<span class="verse" rel="v021001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Utterest vanity! The Speaker declareth: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utterest vanity! All is vanity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 What gain hath a man of all his toil <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereat he toileth under the sun? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 The generations come and go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But evermore the earth abideth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 The sun doth rise, and the sun doth set, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he panteth back to the place of his rising. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 South the wind goeth, and northward it circleth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circling and circling goeth the wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And back on its circling the wind returneth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 All the rivers run into the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nevertheless is the sea not full. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To the place to which the rivers run, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thither they run and run for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 All things are full or weariness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of weariness unutterable, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With all that it sees hath the eye no rest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with all that it hears is the ear unfilled. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 What has been, shall be; what has happened  already, will happen again: there is not a novelty 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 under the sun. When anything occurs that one is  disposed to call really new, it will be found to have 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 happened already – ages before us. Nobody  remembers (to-day) the people of the olden time,  and similarly the people of the after-time will not  be remebered by anybody who comes after them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 I, the Speaker, was king over Israel in Jerusalem; 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 and I gave my mind to the philosophic study and  investigation of all that goes on under the sun. But  a sorry business it is that God has given men to 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 busy themselves with. From my observation of  all that goes on under the sun, I have come to the  conclusion that it is all nothing but an illusion and  a chasing of the wind. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 That which is crooked can never be straightened, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that which is lacking can never be counted. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Then I said to myself, Let me take my own case.  I have amassed wisdom beyond all my predecessors  in Jerusalem, and my experience of wisdom and of 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 knowledge has been a wide one; but after applying  my mind to the study of wisdom and knowledge, madness  and folly, I am convinced that this also is a chasing of the wind; for 
<span class="verse" rel="v021001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Who is rich in wisdom is rich in vexation, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And increase of knowledge brings increase of pain. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> I said to myself, Well now, I will experiment with  pleasure and indulge myself; but I discovered with 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Surprise that this, too, was an illusion. I concluded  that laughter was madness and joy a sterile thing. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 I turned over in my mind how to cheer my senses  with wine – preserving at the same time, however,  my habitual wisdom – and how to embrace folly,  until I should discover what satisfaction may be  procured by men under heaven during the days 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 of their brief lives. I went in for enterprises on an  impressive scale. I had houses built and vineyards 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 planted. I had gardens laid out and parks planted 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 with all sorts of fruit trees, I had reservoirs con-  structed to water the trees that formed the plan- 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 tations. I bought male and female slaves in addition  to the other that had been born in my house. I had  cattle and sheep in abundance – far beyond my 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 predecessors in Jerusalem. Further, I amassed  silver and gold and treasure from (tributary) kings  and from the provinces. I procured male and female  singers and sensuous delighs – concubines in 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 abundance; and richer and richer I grew beyond  all my predecessors in Jerusalem – taking care, how- 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 ever, to retain my wisdom. I refused my eyes  nothing that they longed for, and I did not abstain  from pleasure of any kind, for there was a pleasure  attached to all my effort, and the reward of all my 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 effort I found in that. But when I looked at all  the things my hands had made, and at the effort  that I had spent upon them, it all turned out to be  nothing but an illusion and chasing of the wind: 
<span class="verse" rel="v02100212b" id="00212b" >12b</span>
 here was no profit under the sun. For what will  the king’s successor do but just what has been done  before? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v02100212a" id="00212a" >12a</span>
 Then I turned to the consideration of wisdom and 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 madness and folly, and I saw that wisdom is as  superior to folly as light to darkness; for 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 While the wise have their eyes in their head, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fool walketh in darkness.  Still, I am well aware that in their fate they are 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 both alike. So I said to myself, The fate of the fool  shall be my fate also; and what, in that case, am  I the better for my pre-eminent wisdom? So I 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 said to myself, Here is another illusion. For through  all time the wise man is not remembered any more  than the fool, seeing that in the days to come every  one will be soon forgotten. Alas! the wise man 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 dies just like the fool. So life became odious to  me, because I was vexed with all that goes on under  the sun; for it is all an illusion and a chasing of the wind, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Yes, all the effort that I had spent under the sun  became odious to me, because I should have to 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 leave it to my successor; and who can tell whether  it will be a wise man or a fool that will have the  disposal of the results of all my wise and earnest  toil under the sun? Here is another illusion. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 Then I felt like yielding to despair because 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 of all my laborious toil under the sun; for it  may happen that a man who has toiled with  wisdom, knowledge, and skill has to bequeath the  results of it to another who has done no work upon  it at all. Here, in this great evil, is another illusion. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 For what does a man get from all the striving 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 and the strain of his work under the sun? His days  are all a torture, and his business a vexation: why,  even the night brings no rest to his mind. Here is 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 another illusion. There is, then, no satisfaction for  a man beyond eating and drinking and enjoying  himself as he works. This I saw to be from God’s 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 own hand; for how can there be eating or enjoyment  apart form Him? 
<span class="verse" rel="v021002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 For the man who pleases Him He gives wisdom,  knowledge and happiness; to the sinner, on the other  hand, He gives the task of gathering and amassing,  that it may be given (in the end) to the man who pleases  God.  Here is another illusion and chasing of the wind.  Order of the World <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Everything has its reason appointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every affair under heaven has its time. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 A time to be born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to die. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to plant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to uproot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 A time to slay, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to heal. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to tear down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to build up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 A time to weep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to laugh. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to dance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 A time to scatter stones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to clear them away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to embrace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to refrain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 A time to seek, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to lose. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to preserve, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to throw away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 A time to tear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to sew. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to be silent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to speak. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 A time to love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time to hate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time for war, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time for peace. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 What does the worker gain by all his toil (thought 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 I) as I looked at the tasks that God has assigned  to men to busy themselves with? 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 It is a beautiful orfer that He has established–  evrything at its appointed time. Besides, He has  planted in the human heart (the instinct for) eternity;  only men cannot discern the whole range – from begin-  ning to end – of the work which God is carrying on. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 I am convinced that the only satisfaction that can  be theirs is to be happy and prosperous, while 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 they live. Besides, it is God’s own gift, when a man  is priviledged to eat, drink, and experience happiness  in all his work. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 I am convinced that all that God does is eternal;  it is capable neither of increase nor of diminution:  and God has ordained this, in order to inspire men  with reverence. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Whatever is, has happened already; and what  is yet to happen, already is: for that which has  drifted (into the past) God seeketh out again. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Once more, in the course of my observation under  the sun, I saw that, in the place where judgments  were delivered, there was injustice – yes, injustice  in the very place where justice should have been  administered. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 I said to myself, Yes, but God will judge the just and  the unjust: for He hath appointed a time for every  matter and for every act. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 I said to myself, It is for men’s sake, that God  may show them in their true light, and lead them 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 to see that they are but beasts. For the fate of  men is the fate of beasts: their fate is one and the  same. The one dies like the other. One breath  is in them all, and man is no way superior to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 beasts. For all is but an illusion. All are on their  way to the same place. All sprang from the dust, 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 and to the dust they shall all return. Who can tell  whether the human spirit goes upward and the 
<span class="verse" rel="v021003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 spirit of the beast downward to the earth? So O  recognised that there is no greater satisfaction for  a mn that to be happy in his work – that is his  reward; for, as to what is to happen after him–  who can give him a glimpse of that? <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Once more, I considered all the oppression that  goes on under the sun. I saw the tears of the  oppressed, who have no one to comfort them–  power brutally wielded by the oppressors, and not 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 a soul to comfort them. Happy, thought I, were  the dead who are already dead rather than the 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 living who are still alive; but happier than either  the creature that has never been born, to look upon  the evil work that goes on under the sun. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Then I observed that all the laborious and skilful  work of men has its origin and issue in their jealousy  of one another. Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 The fool foldeth his hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his own flesh he devoureth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Better a single handful of quiet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a chasing of the wind. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Here is another of the illusions that I have 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 observed under the sun. Take, for example, a  lonely man, with no one by his side – he has neither  son nor brother: yet he toils on endlessly; his  eye can never see money enough. "And yet, whom  am I toiling for, and beggaring myself to happi-  ness? "Here is another illusion, a sorry business  indeed. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Two are better than one, for their toil is happily 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 rewarded. If, for example, one should fall, his  comrade helps him to his feet: but woe betide the 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 man who falls, with nobody to help him up. Again,  if two lie together, they get warm: but how can a man 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 get warm by himself? Again, while a solitary  man may be overpowered, two can stand up to an  assailant; while a cord that has three strands  is not lightly snapped. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 A Young man that is poor but wise is better than  a foolish old king who can no longer take a warning. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 There was one such who passed from prison to the  throne, though in the (old king’s) reign he had been 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 born poor; and I obseved that every man alive  that walketh under the sun supported his youthful 
<span class="verse" rel="v021004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 successor. Endless were the people who looked  up to him as leader; and yet in later years their  enthusiasm for him had vanished. Here is another  illusion and a chasing of the wind.  Discharge of Religious Duties <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> walk warily, when you go to the house of God:  to participate in the worship with attentive ear is  better than the sacrifices offered by fools, who are  only versed in the practice of wickedness. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Do not be rash with your tongue, and do not let  your feelings hurry you into speech before God:  for God is in heaven, while you are on earth; your  words ought therefore to be few. For 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 As dreams proceed from multiplied cares, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the din of fools from multiplied words. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 When you make a vow to God, pay it without  delay; for fools incur His displeasure. Pay 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 therefore what you vow. Better not vow than vow 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 and not pay. Do not allow your tongue to involve  you in guilt and punishment; and do not have to  explain to the official that it was a case of inadver-  tence (on your part). Why should you say things  that must provoke God to bring your enterprises 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 To ruin? for multiplied dreams and words bring  multiplied vanities. But hold God in reverence. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Do not be astonished when you see a poor man  crushed, or right and justice plundered in a pro-  vinced; for high officials are perpetually spying upon  one another, and over them are others higher  still. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 It is in every way an advantage to a land to  have a king devoted to the cultivation of the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Who loves money can never have money enough, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lover of riches no increase can satisfy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is another illusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 Increase of wealth bringeth increase in those that consume it: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What gain hath is owner save gazing on it with his eyes? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 Sweet is the sleep of the toiler, whether he eat  much or little; but the satiety of the wealthy  man will not let him sleep. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 One of the grievous evils that I have observed  under the sun is this – wealth hoarded up to its 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 owner’s ruin. The wealth vanishes in some sorry  adventure; and so, after becoming a father, he 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 finds himself with nothing at all. Naked as he  came from his mother’s womb must he go again,  just as he came. For all his toil he can take  nothing away with him that he can carry in his 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 hand. This also is a grievous evil, that he must go  away just as he came; and what has he gained 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 by toiling for the wind? Yes, all his days are  spent in darkness and mourning, in deep vexation,  sickness and anger. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 I claim, as the result of my observation, that it  is an excellent and comely thing (for a man) to eat,  drink, and enjoy himself amid all his laborious  toil under the sun during the days of the brief life 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 which God gives him: for that is his lot. Yes,  when God gives a man wealth and riches and power  to enjoy them, to take his share and be happy in 
<span class="verse" rel="v021005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 his work – this is a gift of God. Such a man will  not think much about the brevity of his life; for  his heart is touched by God to a glad response. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> One of the vexatious things that I have seen under 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 the sun to press heavily upon men is this. Take  the case of a man to whom God has given wealth,  riches, honour, everything heart can desire except  the opportunity to enjoy it– that opportunity falling  to some stranger. Here is a grieveous and painful  illusion. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 If a man be the father of a hundred sons, and live  for many long years, but without having enjoyed  any true satisfaction from his prosperity and without  the honour of burial (in the end), then such a man,  I maintain, is not so fortunate as an untimely 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 birth, which, coming as a futility, departs in dark- 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 ness with its name enveloped in darkness, never  having has sight or knowledge of the sunlight.  It is this, rather than the other, that enjoys rest. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 Though the man should live a thousand years twice  over, yet enjoy no experience of happiness, are not  both on their way to same place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 The toil of man is all for his mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the appetite is unfilled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 What gain hath the wise man more than the fool, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the poor man who walks through the world with discretion? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Better a glimpse with the eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the roaming of the appetite. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 The character of what is has already been deter-  mined, and the destiny of man is already fore-  ordained: he cannot contend with one mightier 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 than himself. For multiplied words mean but  multiplied vanities; and what is man the better? 
<span class="verse" rel="v021006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 Who can tell what is good for man during his life-  time all the days of the brief and empty life that he  passes like a shadow? Who can declare to a man  what is to happen after him under the sun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> A fair name is better than precious ointment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the day of death the day of one’s birth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 It is better to go the house of mourning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to go to the banquetting-house; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch as that is the end of all men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the living should lay it to heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 Vexation is better than laughter; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, when the face is sad, it is well with the heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the heart of the fool in the house of mirth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to lend one’s ears to the song of a fool. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 For like crackling of nettles under kettles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so is the cackle of fools. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is another illusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 Extortion maketh the wise man mad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a bribe destroyeth the character. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 The end of a thing is better than the beginning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the patience is better than pride. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 Do not be hastily vexed in thy temper; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vexation doth lodge in the bosom of fools, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such a question is not of wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 As good as an inheritance is wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gainful to those who behold the sun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 Wisdom defends, even as money defends; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But herein is the greater gain of knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a wisdom is life unto those that possess her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 Consider well the work of God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For who can make straight that which He hath made crooked? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 In happy days be happy, and in the day of misfor-  tune consider: for God has balanced the one against  the other, in order to prevent men from discovering  anything of the future. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 In the course of my illusory life I have witnessed  all sort of things – honest men ruined by their  very honesty, and unprincipled men who owe their 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 long life to their very lack of principle. Do not  be over-pious or over-wise: why court destruction? 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 But neither be over-wicked, nor play the fool: 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007018" id="007018" >18</span>
 why die before your time? It is good, while cling-  ing to the one, not to relax your grasp of the  other; for true religion avoids the excesses of  both. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007019" id="007019" >19</span>
 Wisdom is a mightier protector to the wise than 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 ten men who are in authority over a city. For  there is not a single righteous man upon earth–  a man who does nothing but good and never falls  into sin. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007021" id="007021" >21</span>
 Further, pay no attention to current gossip, in  case you may hear that your servant has cursed 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007022" id="007022" >22</span>
 you; for your conscience tells you that you too  hace cursed others many a time. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007023" id="007023" >23</span>
 I subjected all this to the test of wisdom. I resolved  to acquire wisdom, but she remained remote. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 Yes, the essence of things remained remote – deep  down in depths unfathomable. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 Then, casting about, I gave my mind to the  understanding and investigation of wisdom, to  search after her for results, and to study the folly 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 of wickedness and the madness of folly. And a  thing that I find to be more bitter than death is  woman: for she is a veritable net, with her heart  of snares and her hands of fetters. The man who  enjoys the favour of God escapes her, but the sinner 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007027" id="007027" >27</span>
 is caught by her. Now mark this, says the Speaker.  Putting one thing with another in order to arrive 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007028" id="007028" >28</span>
 at a conclusion – which, however, I have long and  earnestly sought in vain – this at least I have dis-  covered: that there is one man in a thousand–  that I have discovered – but never a woman in all 
<span class="verse" rel="v021007029" id="007029" >29</span>
 that number have I found. This only have I  found-mark it well: that men were created  upright by God, but they have sought out many  contrivances of their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> Who is like the wise man? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is skilled in interpretation? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A man’s wisdom illumines his face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a face that is harsh is transfigured. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 Obey the king’s commands; but, remembering 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 your oath to God, do not be drawn into hasty  action. Leave his presence, and do not embark  upon any hurtful course; for a king can do any- 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 thing he pleases, seeing that his royal word is  authorative, and his conduct unchallengeable. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 He who keeps the commandment will never  come to harm. The wise man knows in his heart 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 that there is an hour of judgment; for everything  has its hour for judgment – and men will be crushed 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 beneath the weight of calamity. For they are  ignorant of the future: who can tell what form it 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 will take? No man can control the day of his  death, any more than he can control or restrain  the wind. In war there is no discharge. Wrong  will secure no immunity for the wrong-doer. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 All this I saw, as I applied my mind to all that  goes on under the sun, at a time when men were  wielding their power over other men to ruin  them.  and there is No Other <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Thereafter I saw wicked men borne to the tomb  from the holy place – men who usde to go about  amid plaudits in the very city where they had so  behaved. Here is another illusion. 
<span class="verse" rel="v02100811f" id="00811f" >11f</span>
 Because sentence is not swiftly executed upon deeds  of wickedness, but a sinner may enjoy a long life thought  he do evil a hundred times over, men’s hearts swell  with the impulse to do evil; though sure I am that it  will be well with those who fear God – I mean those 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 who really reverence Him – but it will not be well with  the wicked: his life will be short as a shadow, because  he has no reverence for God. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 Here is another of the anomalies to be found upon  the earth – honest meb who fare as if they had been  scoundrels, and scoundrels who fare as if they had  been honest men. Here, methought, is another 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 futility. Then I commended mirth – for the only  human satisfaction under the sun is to eat, drink,  and be merry: these are the things that should  accompany men during the days of the laborious  life with God has given them under the sun. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 When I gave my mind to the study of wisdom  and to the observation of the business that is trans-  acted in the world – for day and night one never 
<span class="verse" rel="v021008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 gets a glimpse of sleep – then I recognised that man  is impotent to discover the meaning of all the work  of God that goes on under the sun. However  laboriously men search, they will never discover  it. A wise man may imagine he is on the point of  understanding it, but he can never find it out. <span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> For all this I laid to heart, and my heart observed  it all, that the just, the wise, and their doings are  in the hand of God: no man knows whether it is  to be love or hatred. All that lies ahead of them is 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 vapour, inasmuch as the fate of all is alike – of  saint and scoundrel, good and bad, pure and impure,  those who do and those who do not practise sacrifice.  Good man and sinner fare alike, those who take  oaths and those who are afraid to take them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 This is one of the vexing things that go on uni-  versally under the sun, that the fate of all is alike.  Besides, the human heart is full of evil: all their  life long, madness is in men’s heart, and thereafter 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 they join the dead – not a man is left. There is  hope for all who are in life– a live dog even is 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 better than a dead lion- for the living know at  least that they have to die, but the dead have no  knowledge at all, and no further reward is possible 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 for them – their very memory is forgotten. Their  love, hatred, jealousy, all alike have already  vanished, and for all time they have no share in  anything that goes on under the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Go and eat thy bread with joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink thy wine with a merry heart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For what thou doest is God’s good pleasure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 At all times let thy raiment be white, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let not oil on thy head be lacking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 Enjoy thy life with the woman thou lovest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the days of thy fleeting life, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which He hath given thee under the sun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For that is thy reward in thy life of laborious toil <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; under the sun. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v0210090Do" id="0090Do" >Do</span>
 with thy might whatever thou hast in thy  power to do; for nothing can be done or devised,  known or apprehended, in the under-world to which  thou art going. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 Once more: I observed that under the sun it is  not the swift that win the race, nor the strong that  conquer in battle, neither is wisdom rewarded with  bread, nor insight with wealth, nor intellect with  practical appreciation; all alike are the victims of 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 time and chance. Nobody knows his hour. Men are  like fish caught in a net, or birds in a trap. Like  them men are caught in the meshes in an evil hour,  when suddenly it falls upon them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 The following illustrations of wisdom came under 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 my notice, and it greatly impressed me. There was  a small and thinly garrisoned town, which a power-  ful king came and invested by building huge 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 siege-works against it. But there happened to be  in it a man, poor indeed, but endowed with a wisdom  which enabled him to save the town. Not a soul, 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 However, remembered this poor man. So, me-  thought, wisdom of a poor man is held in contempt, and his  words are not listened to. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 Better wise words that are heard in quiet <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the shrieking of one who is lord among fools. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 Better is wisdom than weapons of war, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one single blunder may ruin much good. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span>
<span class="verse" rel="v021010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 Under the sun this evil I have seen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ’twere the blundering order of a Ruler: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 The fool is set upon a lofty height, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While men of wealth must take a lowly seat. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 Slaves have I seen upon horse-back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And princes walking like slaves on the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As a deadly fly causes stench in the perfumer’s ointment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a little folly can ruin the rarest wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 The sense of a wise an leads him to the right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the sense of a fool to the left. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 As he goes on his way, a fool showeth his lack of sense; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every one saith of him, "There goes a fool." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 If a ruler flare up in a passion against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quit not thy post: for composure <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can lull mighty passions to rest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 He that diggeth a pit may fall therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a serpent may bite him that breaks through a wall; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 He that quarrieth stones may be hurt by them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the man who cleaves wood is imperilled thereby. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 If the iron be blunt, and you whet not its edge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must use more strength. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He succeeds who can claim the advantage of wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 If a serpent bite for lack of enchantment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the skillful charmer hath no advantage. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 The words of a wise man’s mouth win him favour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a fool by his lips is brought to ruin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 From the first the words of his mouth are folly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the end of his speech is calamitous madness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 The fool maketh many words. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man knoweth not the future; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And what shall happen after him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who can declare unto him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010015" id="010015" >15</span>

 Alas for thee, land! when thy king is a youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy princes feast in the early morning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 But hail to thee, land! when thy king is a noble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy princes feast at the proper season, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like men and not like sots. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 Through idleness the roof sinks in, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And through slackness of hands does the house fall a-leaking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 Feasts are made for mirth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wine cheers the heart of the living, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And money answereth all things. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 Even in thy thought curse not the king, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And curse not the rich in thy sleeping-chamber; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a bird of the air may carry the sound, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the thing that hath wings may declare the matter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> Cast thy bread on the face of the waters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For after many days thou shalt find it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 Give a portion to seven, yea, even to eight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou knowest not what evil may come on the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 When the clouds are filled with rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They empty it over the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If a tree falls northward or southward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the place where it falls it remains. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 He who always is watching the wind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never gets to his sowing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He who always is scanning the clounds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never gets to his reaping. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor how the child grows in the womb of the mother, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So knowest thou not how God doth work– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He who worketh in all things evermore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 In the morning sow thy seed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And till evening rest not thy hand; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou knowest not which of the two shall prosper, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or whether both shall be good alike.  Age are Many and Sure <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 Sweet is the light, and pleasant it is <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the eyes to behold the sun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For, though a man live many years, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of them filled with gladness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet let him remember the days of darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many shall they be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that cometh is vapour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 Rejoice, young man, in thy youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep thy young heart merry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk in the ways of thy heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in all that allureth thine eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But know that for all these things <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God will bring thee to judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 Put vexation away from thy mind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And banish all gloom from thy body– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For youth and life’s dawn are illusions– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> But keep thy Creator in mind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days of thy prime: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the gloomy days come on, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the years arrive when thou sayest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " No pleasure are they to me:" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 The days when the sun grows dark, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the light, and the moon, and the stars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rain is followed by clouds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And the guards of the house fall a-trembling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mighty men are bent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The grinders cease, being few, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that look through the windows are darkened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 The doors in the street are shut, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sound of the mill is low, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the twitter of birds is faint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the daughters of son are all feeble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012005" id="012005" >5</span>
 Yea, (the old) are afraid of a height, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the road is for them full of terrors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The almond-tree wears it blossoms, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grasshopper limps along, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the caperberry is powerless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the man goes his way to his long, long home, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mourners wander about the streets– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 On the day when the silver cord is snapped, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANd the bowl (with the) golden (oil) is broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the pitcher is shattered over the spring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wheel falls into the cistern broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012007" id="012007" >7</span>
 And the dust goes back to the earth as it was, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the breath returns to the God who gave it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The Speaker, besides being wise, further instructed  the people in knowledge, weighing and searching it  out, and arranging it in the form of copious proverbs. 
<span class="verse" rel="v021012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 The Speaker made it his study to devise sayings  that were at once true and attractive, and to record  them in proper form. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v021012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 The words of wise men, as collected, are like goads,  or like nails driven home; but they are (all) the gift  of one shepherd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012Beyond" id="012Beyond" >Beyond</span>
 these, too, my son, take warning. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Books are so many, their making is endless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this is the essence of all that is human. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v021012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 For God will bring every work to the judgment <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is passed on all secret things, good or bad.
