<span class="verse" rel="v020001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 That people may learn wisdom and discipline, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and understand words of discernment; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 that they may win training in prudence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in right and in justice and rectitude; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 that shrewdness be imparted to the simple, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and knowledge and insight to youth – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 the wise too, who listens, will grow wiser, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the prudent more skilled in direction – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 that proverbs and parables may be plain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even the words of the wise and their riddles </p><h6>The Motto of the Book</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Reverence for the Lord is the basis of knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but wisdom and discipline are scorned by fools. </p><h6>Exhortation and Warning</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Listen, my child, to your father’s instruction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and do not forsake what you mother has taught you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 they will be a garland to your head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a chain for your neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 My son, if sinners entice you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not consent. 
<span class="verse" rel="v020001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 If they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Come with us, let us lurk for the blameless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ambush the innocent for fun – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 let us swallow them up like the grave, alive <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and entire, just as those that go down to the pit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Precious wealth of all sorts will be ours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we will fill our houses with spoil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Cast your lot with us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we will all share what we steal,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Do not go their way, my child. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your foot away from their path. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 For their feet hasten to evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they rush to shed blood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 The net is spread in the sight of the birds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who hungrily take the bait. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Their own is the blood they lurk for. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their own are the lives they ambush. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 So end all who would grasp at gain – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it destroys the life of its owner. </p><h6>The Appeal of Wisdom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Wisdom cries aloud in the streets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the squares echoes her voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 she calls from the top of the walls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the doors of the city gates she says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 ‘How long will you fools love folly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and scoffers delight in scoffing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fools in their hatred of knowledge? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 Respond to my rebuke. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See! I speak my mind to you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell you my thoughts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 Because you refused my call, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gave no heed to my hand when it beckoned you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 rejected all my counsel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and refused my admonition, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 when distress falls on you, I will laugh; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will mock, when your terror comes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 when your terror comes as a storm, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a whirlwind your distress. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001028" id="001028" >28</span>
 Then I will not answer their call; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they may seek, but they will not find me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001029" id="001029" >29</span>
 Because they hated knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rejected the fear of the Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001030" id="001030" >30</span>
 would have nothing of my counsel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but despised all my admonition, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001031" id="001031" >31</span>
 they must eat the fruit of their ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and be filled with their own devices. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001032" id="001032" >32</span>
 By their own choice will the simple be slain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prosperous ease will bring fools to destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020001033" id="001033" >33</span>
 But he who listens to me will live securely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a peace unruffled by fear of calamity.’           </p><h6>The Blessed Fruits of Wisdom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> My child, if you welcome my words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hold close my commandments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 giving heedful ear to wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bending your mind to reason; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 if you seek to invoke understanding. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lift up your voice to reason, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 seeking for her as if for silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and searching for her as if for treasure: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 then the fear of the Lord will be plain to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the knowledge of God you will find. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 For the Lord is the giver of wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The source of knowledge and insight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 He stores up ability for the upright; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he shields the blameless life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 He guards the paths of the just, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he watches the way of the faithful. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Then justice and right will be plain to you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will keep to all paths that are good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 When wisdom will enter your mind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in knowledge you find your pleasure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 discretion will watch over you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and understanding will guard you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 and save you from wicked ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from people of perverse speech, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 who leave the paths of right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to walk in ways of darkness – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 happy in doing wrong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exulting in wicked perverseness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 all crooked in their paths. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and devious in their ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 From the adultress too, it will save you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sinning woman of slippery speech, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 who forsakes the partner of her youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and forgets her bond with her God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 for her house sinks down to death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and her paths lead to the place of the dead. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 None that visit her ever come back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or arrive at the paths of life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 Therefore walk in the way of good people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in the paths of the righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 for the upright will live in the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the blameless alone will enjoy it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 while bad people are cut off from it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the faithless uprooted. </p><h6>The Wisdom of Trusting and Honouring the Lord</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> My son, do not forget my teaching, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep my commandments in mind; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 for a long and happy life <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fulness of peace will they bring you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Let not kindness and faithfulness leave you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind them about your neck; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 so favour and good repute will you find <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alike with God and people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Trust the Lord with all your heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lean not on your own understanding: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 in all your ways acknowledge him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he will smooth your paths. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Do not pride yourself on your wisdom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fear the Lord and turn from evil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Then there will be health to your body, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and refreshment to your bones. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 If you honour the Lord with your wealth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the first-fruits of all that comes in to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 your barns will be filled with corn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with wine will your vats overflow.           </p><h6>The Worth of Wisdom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Reject not, my son, the Lord’s chastening. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not spurn His reproof. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he reproves the child he delights in. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Happy those who find wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they who obtain understanding. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 For she brings a gain fairer than silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a revenue better than gold. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 More precious is she than corals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with her can no treasures compare. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 In her right hand is long life, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in her left are riches and honour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 Her ways are pleasant ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all her paths are peace. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 She is a tree of life to those who grasp her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy they who hold her fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by understanding established the heavens. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 By knowledge he broke up the deeps. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the clouds he made drip with dew.  ************* </p><h6>The Security that comes from Wisdom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Observe, my child, discretion and wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let them never out of your sight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 so will they be life to you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ornament round your neck. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 You will then go your way securely. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without ever striking your foot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 You will sit down unafraid, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your sleep will be sweet where you lie. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 You will fear no sudden terror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor the tempest that falls on the wicked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 For the Lord is the ground of your hope. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will keep your foot from the snare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003027" id="003027" >27</span>
 Withhold from your neighbour no good <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which you have in your power to do them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003028" id="003028" >28</span>
 Do not tell them – when you can afford it – to go <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and come back, with the promise of something tomorrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003029" id="003029" >29</span>
 Devise no mischief against your neighbour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while they are trustfully living beside you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003030" id="003030" >30</span>
 Do not idly quarrel with anyone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has not done you any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003031" id="003031" >31</span>
 Do not envy the violent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or choose any one of their ways. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020003032" id="003032" >32</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v020008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 At the very beginning God fashioned me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the first of His works of old. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008023" id="008023" >23</span>
 In the ancient time was I formed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the first, when the world began. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008024" id="008024" >24</span>
 I was born when as yet no depths were, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no fountains laden with water; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 Ere yet the mountains were sunk, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and before the hills was I born; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008026" id="008026" >26</span>
 Ere the earth and the fields were created, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the first of the clods of the world. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 When He set up the heavens, I was there; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when He vaulted the face of the deep; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008028" id="008028" >28</span>
 When He made firm the skies above, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fixed the deep fast at its sources; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008029" id="008029" >29</span>
 When He set to the sea its bounds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as He marked off the base of the world. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008030" id="008030" >30</span>
 Then beside Him was I as His nursling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I was His daily delight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; playing before Him at all times, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020008031" id="008031" >31</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v020022021" id="022021" >21</span>
 to acquaint you with words of truth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with answers for those who would question you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020022022" id="022022" >22</span>
 Rob not the poor because he is poor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and crush not the weak in the gate; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020022023" id="022023" >23</span>
 For the Lord will defend their cause, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will rob of their lives those who rob them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Do you see a man expert in his business? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will stand in the presence of kings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but before obscure men he will not stand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="023001">23</span> If you sit at a ruler’s table, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consider well who is before you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v020023030" id="023030" >30</span>
 Those that linger over wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those that drink spiced wine with a relish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Look not on the ruddy wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when in the cup it sparkles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoothly it glides down; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The man who deviseth mischief <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is known among men as a schemer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020024009" id="024009" >9</span>

 These also belong to the wise men: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is wrong to be partial in giving of judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020024024" id="024024" >24</span>
 All men will curse and all people will execrate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him who pronounces the guilty man innocent. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Set your business in order without, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make all ready in your fields: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after that you may build up your house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020024028" id="024028" >28</span>

 By the field of the sluggard I passed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the vineyard of one that was foolish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020024031" id="024031" >31</span>
 It was all overgrown with thistles; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its surface was covered with nettles; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its wall of stone was in ruins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020024032" id="024032" >32</span>
 As I looked, I thought upon it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I drew from the sight a lesson. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 ‘Just a little more sleep, a little more slumber, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a little more lying with folded hands.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Better be told, ‘Come up hither,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than be humbled before the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Do not hastily bring up a law-suit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of something your eyes have seen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For what will you do in the end, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when your neighbour has put you to shame? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020025009" id="025009" >9</span>
 Discuss the affair with your neighbour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reveal not his secret to others; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v020025010" id="025010" >10</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v020025014" id="025014" >14</span>
 As clouds and wind that yet bring no rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so is one that boasts of gifts that he gives not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v020031005" id="031005" >5</span>
