<span class="verse" rel="v023001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Hear, you heavens, and give ear, O earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  Himself is the Speaker. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟Sons have I reared and brought up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but rebellious to Me are they grown. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 An ox knows its owner, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and an ass its master’s crib; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but Israel does not know, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my people do not consider.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Ah! sinful nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you people laden with guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you brood of evil-doers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you children all corrupt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that have forsaken the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and spurned the Holy One of Israel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Why would you court more stripes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by straying yet further from Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The head is sick altogether, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the heart is all diseased. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 From the sole of the foot to the head <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no soundness therein: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought but bruises and weals <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wounds that are raw and bleeding, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all unpressed and unbandaged, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all unsoftened with oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Your land is a desolation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your cities are burned with fire; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the fields before your eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are being devoured by aliens. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 And the daughter of Zion is left <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all alone like a booth in a vineyard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a lodge in a cucumber-field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a turret where men keep watch. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Were it not that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had left us a remnant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; our fate has been wellnigh like Sodom’s, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or like to Gomorrah’s. </p><h6>The Futility of a Merely Ceremonial Worship</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Give ear to the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you rulers of Sodom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and hear what our God has to teach you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you folk of Gomorrah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says, ‟What care I <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your multiplied sacrifices? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sick of burnt offerings of rams <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fat of fed beasts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; blood of bullocks, of lambs, or goats, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is no pleasure to Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 When you gather to gaze on My face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has asked you for these things? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Trample My courts no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Bring offerings no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Vain is the smoke of sacrifice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me ’tis abomination. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The new moon and Sabbath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the call to assembly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the fast and the festival <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot (endure). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 They weigh Me down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am tired of the burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 When therefore you spread out your hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will hide from you Mine eyes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; when you make your many prayers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not listen to you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Your hands are full of blood: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash, and make you clean. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Banish out of My sight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wicked things that you do. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Cease to do evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Learn to do well. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let justice be ever your care, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; punish the man of violence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; win for the orphan his rights, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and defend the cause of the widow.’ </p><h6>The Great Alternatives</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 ‟Come,’ says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, ‟and now <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let us reason together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sins, though like scarlet, may yet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become white as the snow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And though they be crimson-red, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they may yet be as wool. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 If you be obedient and willing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall taste the good of the land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 But if you refuse and rebel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟Tis the sword you shall taste: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mouth of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken it.’ </p><h6>Zion’s Present Shame and Future Glory</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 Alas! how the once faithful City <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has turned to be harlot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She that was once full of justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she wherein righteousness lodged, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is now haunted by murderers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 Your silver is now become dross, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your wine mixed with water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 Your rulers are grown to be rebels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the comrades of the thieves- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Every man of them fond of his bribe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunting ever for gifts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; caring nought for the rights of the orphan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the cause of the widow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 Therefore thus says the Lord, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Mighty One of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘From Mine enemies who resist Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will get Me the comfort of vengeance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 I will turn My hand against you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will smelt out your dross in the furnace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all your alloy remove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 Judges, like those of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and counsellors as of yore, I will give you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter shall you called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the City of Justice, the Faithful City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 By justice shall Zion be ransomed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by righteousness her people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001028" id="001028" >28</span>
 But together rebels and sinners be crushed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those that abandon the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall perish. </p><h6>The Heathen Cult and its Doom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001029" id="001029" >29</span>
 For the trees you delight in shall bring you to shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and abashed shall you be for your gardens beloved. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001030" id="001030" >30</span>
 Like a tree with withered leaves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall you be-like a waterless garden. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023001031" id="001031" >31</span>
 Like tow shall the strong man become, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the thing he has wrought like a spark; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and both shall burn together <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a flame that cannot be quenched. </p><h6>Jerusalem the Centre of Blessing to the World; Arbitration, Disarmament, and International Peace</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> The message of Isaiah the son of Amoz: his vision of Judah and Jerusalem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 In the after-time it shall be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the mountain of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be set at the head of the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and exalted above the hills. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All the peoples shall thither stream, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Many nations shall go and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Come, let us go to the mount of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the house of the God of Jacob. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That He in His ways may instruct us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that we in His paths may walk. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For instruction proceeds from Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  from Jerusalem.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 He will judge the disputes of the peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and for manifold nations so justly will arbitrate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that their swords they will beat into ploughshares, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to pruning-hooks their spears. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and war they shall learn no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 O household of Jacob, come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let us walk in the light of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. </p><h6>the </h6><p><span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s Judgement-Day <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 (Get you into the caves of the rocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hide in the holes of the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s dread face, when in glory majestic <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he rises with terror to smile the earth.)  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For He has forsaken His people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the household of Jacob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled is his land from the east with diviners, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with soothsayers like to the Philistines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sorcerers, children of aliens. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Filled in his land full of silver and gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his treasure is endless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled in his land full of horses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his chariots are endless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Filled is his land full of idols, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he worships the work of his hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that his fingers have made. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 So the pride of men shall be humbled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid low shall man’s loftiness be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that day shall the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  alone be exalted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Get you into the rocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hide in the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s dread presence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and glory majestic.  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 For a day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is coming <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon all that is haughty and proud, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon all that is lofty and high- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Upon cedars if Lebanon all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and oaks of Bashan all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Upon all the great mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all the high hills, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Upon all the proud towers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all fortified walls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002016" id="002016" >16</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Then the pride of men shall be humbled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid low shall man’s loftiness be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and that day shall the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  alone be exalted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 The Idols shall all of them vanish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Get you into the caves of the rocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the holes of the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s dread face, when in glory majestic <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he rises with terror to smile the earth.  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 That day shall men cast away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the moles and to the bats <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; their idols of silver and gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which they made for themselves to worship; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 And into the caves of the rocks they shall get them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and into the rents of the cliffs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s dread face, when in glory majestic <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he rises-with terror to smite the earth.  <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Oh cease your trust in man, in whose nostrils is but a breath. Of what account is he? </p><h6>A Reign of Anarchy</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Behold, the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take staff and stay from Jerusalem and Judah- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Soldiers and Warriors, judges and prophets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Deviners and elders, and captains of fifty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; men of distinction, and men of sage counsel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cunning magicians and skilful enchanters. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 And boys I will give then for princes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and men of caprice shall rule over them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 The people shall play the tyrant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each man over his neighbour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The young shall be rude to the aged, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man of low rank to the high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 One shall take hold of his fellow, and say to him: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Your family has a robe; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; come, and do you be our ruler, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and take this ruin in hand.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Then will the other protest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Nay, verily:   I   cannot heal you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In my own house there is no bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor yet is there a robe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall not thrust upon   me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leadership of the people.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Jerusalem is stumbling to ruin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Judah must surely fall; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for by word and by deed they defy the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoking those glorious eyes of His. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Their respecting of persons is witness against them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like Sodom they publish their sin undisguisedly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe unto them! They have wrought their own ruin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Happy righteous! For well they shall fare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall reap the fruit of their doings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 But woe to the wicked! For ill they shall fare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their deeds shall be recompensed unto them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 My people are cruelly governed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extortions rule over them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O My people, your leaders mislead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and confuse the way you should go. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is taking His place for the trial, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stands to judge His people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  summons to judgment <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the elders and princes of His people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Yes,   you   have devoured the vineyard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 What mean you by crushing My people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and grinding the faces of the poor?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; says the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts. </p><h6>The Doom of the Haughty Women</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Moreover the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Because Zion’s daughters are haughty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; walking with heads held high, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and eyes for ever ogling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with dainty little steps, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and anklets ever jingling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 The Lord shall smite with a scab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the head of the daughters of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their shame shall the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lay bare <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 That day the Lord will remove <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the finery of the anklets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the net-bands and the moons, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 The ear-drops and bracelets and veils, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 The head-dresses, armlets, and sashes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the perfume-boxes and amulets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 the signet-rings and the nose-rings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 the state-gowns, the mantles, the shawls, and the satchels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 the gauzes and linens, the turbans and veils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 Sweet scents shall give place unto stench, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the girdle be changed for a rope. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And well-set hair shall be bald, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and for elegant robe shall be sackcloth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for beauty the brand (of a slave). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 Your liegemen shall fall by the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your mighty men in the battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 Her gates shall lament and mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as she sixtieth despoiled on the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 That day shall seven women <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take hold of one man and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Our own bread will we eat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and our rainment will we wear; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but oh, let us bear your name, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and take our reproach away.’ </p><h6>Zion’s Final Glory</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 In that day <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; shall the wild vegetation be glorious and fair, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fruit of the tilled land majestic and comely <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Israel’s sons that escape. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 And those that remain in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those that are left in Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be called by the name of holy- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all who stand in the book of life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 When the Lord shall have washed away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the filth of the daughters of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and rinsed away from her midst <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the blood-stains of Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; by means of the blast of judgment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the blast of extermination, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Then will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and o’er the whole site of mount Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and over all the glory <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Shall cover and canopy be – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A shade by day from the heat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a refuge and shelter from storm and rain. </p><h6>The Song of the Vineyard</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> A song will I sing of my friend, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a love-song touching his vineyard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A vineyard belonged to my friend, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a fertile hill-top he had set it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 He had dug it and cleared it of stones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and choice vines therein he had planted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A tower he had built in the midst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a winepress therein he had hewn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he looked for a yield of good grapes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the grapes that it yielded were wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 Now judge, you that dwell in Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you that are freemen of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; judge between me and my vineyard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 What more could I do for my vineyard <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I had neglected to do? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And why, when I looked for good grapes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did it yield only grapes that were wild? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 So now let me give you to know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what I purpose to do my vineyard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tear off its hedge, that the beasts may devour it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will break through its wall, that they trample it down. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 I will make it waste, all unpruned and unweeded, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with thorns and with briars overgrown shall it be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the clouds I will order to withhold from it rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 For the vineyard of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts is the household of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the freeman of Judah His cherished plantation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of the justice He looked for was bloodshed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead of the right was the cry (of the wronged). </p><h6>The National Sins: Woe!</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Woe unto you who join house unto house <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and who add one field to another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; till no one has room but you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you settle the land by yourselves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts in mine ear has whispered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; surely many a great fine house <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be desolate and empty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but eight gallons, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the harvest shall be but one tenth of the seed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 Woe unto them that rise early <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to give themselves to drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and to those that sit late in the evening, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inflaming themselves with wine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 Whose banquets of wine are enlivened <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with lute, harp, timbrel, and flute; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but all blind to the work of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they see not the things He is doing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 Therefore all unaware shall My people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be swept into exile afar – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their nobleman dying of hunger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their populace parched with thirst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Therefore Sheol with ravenous throat <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opens wide her jaws without measure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And down shall her splendour go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and her noisy tumultuous rabble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with all that in her was exultant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 And there shall lambs graze as at pasture, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fatlings shall feed in her ruins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 Thus through judgment the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts is exalted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the holy God shows Himself holy by righteousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 Woe unto those that draw penalty on <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by their sin, as by stout wagon-ropes drawn by oxen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 That say, ‘Let Him haste, let Him act with speed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in order that we may see it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let the purpose of Israel’s Holy One come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so near that we recognize it.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 Woe unto those that call evil good, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and good evil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to those that turn light into darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and darkness to light; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to those that turn sweet into bitter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bitter to sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005021" id="005021" >21</span>
 Woe unto those that esteem themselves wise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that fancy themselves to be prudent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005022" id="005022" >22</span>
 Woe unto those that are valiant in wine-drinking, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warriors brave at the mingling of drink; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005023" id="005023" >23</span>
 Whom a bribe will induce to acquit the guilty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and innocent men to deprive of their rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005024" id="005024" >24</span>
 As fire licks up the stubble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hay is shrivelled in flame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so their root shall turn to rottenness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their blossom go up in dust; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because they rejected the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s instruction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the message of Israel’s Holy One scorned. </p><h6>A Foreign Army is Coming</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005025" id="005025" >25</span>
 So against His people His anger was kindled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against them He stretched forth His hand and He smote them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains shook, and the dead <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lay like refuse about the streets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For all this His anger is not turned back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but His hand is stretched out still. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005026" id="005026" >26</span>
 To a far-distant nation He raises His signal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and whistles for them from the end of the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; See! hastily, swiftly they come – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005027" id="005027" >27</span>
 None weary, none stumbling among them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsleeping and slumbering never: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The band of their loins never loosed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the thong of their shoes never torn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005028" id="005028" >28</span>
 Their arrows are sharp, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their bows are all bent: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The hoofs of their horses are counted as flint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their wheels as the whirlwind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005029" id="005029" >29</span>
 Their roar is like that of a lioness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and like the young lions they roar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; growling and seizing the prey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bearing it far beyond rescue. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023005030" id="005030" >30</span>
 That day they shall roar over him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a roar like the roar of the sea: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When he looks on the earth, behold! darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the light has grown dark in the clouds. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> In the year that King Uzi died, I had a vision of the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v023006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 the skirts if His robe filled the Temple. Before Him were standing seraphs, each with six wings – two for covering the face, two the loins, and two 
<span class="verse" rel="v023006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 to fly with; and thus they kept calling to one another: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Holy, holy, holy, is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole earth is filled with His glory.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 At the sound of their calling the foundations of threshold shook, and the House began to fill 
<span class="verse" rel="v023006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 with smoke. Then I said <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Woe is me, for I am undone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for a man of unclean lips am I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I dwell in a nation of unclean lips; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and yet mine eyes have seen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the King, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which with tongs he had taken 
<span class="verse" rel="v023006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 from off the altar. With this he touched my mouth, and said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘See, this has touched your lips: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your guilt is past and your sin forgiven.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Then I heard the voice of the Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saying, ‘Whom shall I send? who will go for us?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I said, ‘Here am I, send me.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Then He said, ‘Go and say to this people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Hear ever, but understand never; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see ever, but comprehend never.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 Make the people’s minds dull, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; block their ears and cover their eyes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their minds understand, and their health come again.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 Then I said, ‘Till cities lie wasted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with not an inhabitant left; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; till houses hold men no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the land is left a desolation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 till the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  removes men afar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wide tracts of the land lie forsaken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 And should there be in it a tenth still left, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that too, in its turn, must be given to the fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the stump of an oak or a terebinth felled.’ </p><h6>The Prophet’s World to the Terrified King</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> In the days Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, Rezin King of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched against Jerusalem to attack it: but they were unable to develop an actual assault upon it. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 When news reached the Court that the Aramean army was on Ephraimite soil, the heart of Ahaz and his people shook like forest-trees before the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 wind. Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Isaiah, ‘Go out– you and your son Shear-yashub – to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 Fuller’s Field Road, and say to him: Be careful to keep calm: be not faint-hearted or afraid of this pair of fire-brands that are nothing but smoking stumps. Be not afraid of the fierce anger of Rezin 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Aram and Ephraim with the son of Remaliah have indeed 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 plotted your ruin: their purpose is to invade Judah, and, after reducing her straits, to break into (Jerusalem); then, having overpowered her, they purpose to set the son of Tabeelon the throne. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 But thus says the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’This thing shall not succeed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it shall not come to pass. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 For the head of Aram is Damascus, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the head of Damascus is Rezin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your faith must firmly hold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you would yourselves be held.’’ </p><h6>The Great Refusal and the Sign</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v023007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 One more I addressed Ahaz thus, ‘Ask the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<span class="verse" rel="v023007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 your God for a sign – ask it (if you like) either from the depths of the under-world or from the heights above.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 ‘No,’ replied Ahaz, ‘I will not ask for one: that would be equivalent to submitting the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to a test.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 Then I said, ‘Hear then, you household of David. Is not enough for you to weary mortal men that you must weary my God as well? 
<span class="verse" rel="v023007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 You shall have a sign therefore from the Lord Himself. Behold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A maid is with child, she shall bring forth a son, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shall call his name Immanuel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 Honey and curd shall he eat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when he knows how to choose what is good, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to shun what is evil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 For ere the child shall know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to choose what is good <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to shun what is evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that land shall be deserted <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose two kings you so dreaded. </p><h6>Judah shall also be Ravaged</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall bring upon you your people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on your father’s house <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; such days as have never yet been, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since Ephraim departed from Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007018" id="007018" >18</span>
 That day it shall come to pass <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall whistle for the flies and the bees. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007019" id="007019" >19</span>
 They shall come every one, and then down they <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall settle <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in the steep-walled ravines and in clefts of the rocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on all thorn-hedges and places of pasture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 That day shall the Lord shave bare <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a razor that is hired <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the land beyond the River <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; both the head and hidden hair; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the beard too shall be snipped. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007021" id="007021" >21</span>
 And in that day shall a man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep but two sheep and a cow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007022" id="007022" >22</span>
 Yet the plenteous yield of milk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall supply him fare of curd. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fare of every man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is left upon the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be nought but curd and honey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007023" id="007023" >23</span>
 And in that day every spot <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where were once a thousand vines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; worth a thousand silver pieces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall with thorns and briers be covered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 With bow and with arrow shall men come thither, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all the land shall be thorns and briers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 Fear of thorns and briers shall hold men afar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the hills that used to be hoed with the hoe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There cattle shall wander and sheep shall tread. </p><h6>The Fall of Damascus and Samaria</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, ‘Take a large tablet, and write upon it in the common script ’Speed-spoil 
<span class="verse" rel="v023008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 Hurry-prey;’ and take (two) reliable witnesses, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.’ Then after the prophetess, through my approach to her, had conceived and borne a son, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, ‘Call his name Speed-spoil Hurry-prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 For ere the child shall know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to cry ’My farther! My mother!’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The wealth of Damascus, the spoil of Samaria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be carried away to the king of Assyria.’ </p><h6>The Invasion of Judah</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v023008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 Once more I had a message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – it was this: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 ‘Because this people has spurned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gentle stream of Shiloah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and melt with fear of Rezin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the son of Remaliah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 Therefore, behold, the Lord <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will speedily bring upon them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the waters of the River, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great and mighty River <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it shall rise above all its channels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and overflow all its banks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 On it shall sweep over Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an overflowing flood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that shall reach as high as the neck.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But (the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s) outstretched wings <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall cover the breadth of the land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for with us is God. </p><h6>The Futility of Opposition to Judah</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 You may storm as you will, you nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall be shattered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All you far-distant lands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth, give ear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You may gird yourselves for the fray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you all shall be shattered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 You may forge your plans as you will, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall all be confounded. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Be your resolves what they will, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall not be accomplished; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for with us is God. </p><h6>None is to be Feared but the </h6><p><span class="nd"> Lord </span><br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 These were the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s words to me, as He grasped me with His hand and warned me not to walk in the ways of the people: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 ‘Call you not all a conspiracy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that this people calls conspiracy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share not their fears and their dreads. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts – it is He <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you should count as the great Conspirator. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Him be your fear and your dread. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 A stone and a rock He shall prove, whereon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both houses of Israel shall strike and stumble – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a trap and a snare to the folk of Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 Many among them shall stumble and fall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be broken and snared and taken. </p><h6>Isaiah’s Patient Hope</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v023008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 I will seal my teaching and fasten my message 
<span class="verse" rel="v023008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 in (the heart of) my disciples. I will patiently wait for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who hides His face from the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 household of Israel; I will set my hope in Him. I myself and the children the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given me are in Israel as signs and symbols from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts whose home is on Mount Zion. </p><h6>The Awful Plight of Unbelieving Judah</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v023008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 When they tell you have recourse to ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and mutter, ask them if a nation should not rather have recourse to its God. Why should they consult the dead on behalf 
<span class="verse" rel="v023008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 of the living? Assuredly they shall (one day) clamour for the teaching and the message, when there is no day-break for them any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 They shall range through the land sore pressed and hungry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hunger shall curse their king and their God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 They shall lift up their eyes to the heavens above, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall look to the earth beneath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but nought shall they see save distress and anguish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thick impenetrable gloom. </p><h6>The Great Deliverance and the Glorious King</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> In the former time He brought the territory of Zebulon and Naphtali into contempt, but in the latter time has He covered with glory the ground held by the nations beyond the Jordan on the way to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 The people that walked in darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have seen a glorious light: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that dwelt in the land of gloom – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on them the light has shone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 You have multiplied their gladness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and given them great joy: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The joy they made in Your presence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was like the joy of harvest; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; their gladness was like the gladness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of men who divide the spoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 For the yoke that pressed so heavy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the bar upon their shoulders, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the rod of their taskmasters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have broken as on Midian’s day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 Every boot of thundering warrior, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every war-cloak drenched with blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; is destined for the burning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be fuel for the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 For to us a child is born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unto us a son is given, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; on whose shoulder is dominion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is the name he bears – <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Counsellor most wonderful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; god with the warrior might, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; father everlasting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prince of the reign of peace.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Great is the dominion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and endless is the peace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; upon the throne of David, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and over all his realm: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To establish and uphold it <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the righteousness and justice <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from henceforth and for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The zeal of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall bring this thing to pass. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Israel it shall alight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 With a power all the people shall feel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Ephraim and in Samaria. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have stiffened their neck in pride, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in their stoutness of heart they have said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 ‘The bricks are fallen down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but now we will build with hewn stone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The sycamores are cut down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but with cedars we will replace them.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 So against them the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has stirred up their foes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has spurred their enemies on; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 Syrians east, and Philistines west, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have with open mouth devoured Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet for all this His anger is not turned back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but His hand is stretched out still.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 But the people turned not unto Him that smote them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor did they resort to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 So He cut off from Israel head and tail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palm-branch and rush in a single day. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 The elders and men of repute are the head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the prophets whose teaching is false are the tail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 Those who should lead this people mislead them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those whom they ought to have led are destroyed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 The Lord will therefore not spare 
<span class="verse" rel="v023009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 their youths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on their orphans and widows He teeth no pity <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for each and all are profane and wicked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and every mouth speaks impious folly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet for all this His anger is not turned back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but His hand is stretched out still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 For wickedness blazed like a fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that devours first thorns and briers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; then sets forest thickets aflame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till they roll in columns of smoke. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 By the breath of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the land was scorched, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the people became like cannibals. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 They carved on the right, yet were hungry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devoured on the left, unappeased; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no man did pity his fellow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but each ate the flesh of his neighbour – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and both against Judah together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet for all this His anger is not turned back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but His hand is stretched out still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> Woe unto those that give mischievous verdicts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elaborate scrolls that bring sorrow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 By robbing the weak of their rights <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by plundering the poor of their due, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so that widows become their spoil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and orphans fall a prey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 But what will you do in the Day of Assize <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which will come like a crash from afar? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom will you flee for help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and where will you leave your abundance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 That you crouch not under the prisoners <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or fall among the slain? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet for all this His anger is not turned back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but his hand is stretched out still. </p><h6>The Two Plans – Assyria’s and the Lord’s</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 Oh! Assyria! Rod of mine anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and staff of Mine indignation! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 Against an impious people I send Him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a nation that sore has provoked Me to wrath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and I solemnly charge him to spoil and to plunder <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and trample them down like the mire of the streets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 Not such, however,   his   fancy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor such the thought of his heart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but his thought is the utter destruction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of nations not a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 ‘Are my captains,’ he says, ‘not all kings? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Is not Calno’s fate like Carchemish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and Hamath’s fate like Arpad’s, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Samaria’s like Damascus? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010010" id="010010" >10</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 And shall I not do to Jerusalem <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to her images also, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as I have done to Samaria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to her idols also? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 When the Lord has accomplished all His work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, He will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his lofty looks. For the Lord has said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 By the strength of my hand have I done it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by my cunning discernment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; removing the bounds of the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and plundering their treasures. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I have brought down cities to ashes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to dust those that dwell therein. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 I thrust my hand in the wealth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the nations, as into a nest; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and all the earth have I gathered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as one gathers eggs that are left: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not a wing that fluttered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; none opened the mouth or chirped.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Shall an axe boast over the man that wields it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or saw treat with insolence him that handles it? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As if ever a rod could swing him that lifts it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or staff of wood could brandish a man! </p><h6>The Fate of Assyria and Judah</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 So into his fat shall the Lord <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts send leanness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and under his splendour a burning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall burn like the burning of fire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 That flaming fire is the Holy One, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he that is Israel’s Light; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it shall blaze and devour his thorns <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his briers in a single day. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 His glorious forest and gardens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall vanish, body and soul, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a sick man pinning away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 That day it shall come to pass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that no more shall the remnant of Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; or those that escape of the household of Israel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lean upon him that smote them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall loyally lean on the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy One of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 A remnant shall return, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even a remnant of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unto the mighty God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 For though your people, O Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be even as the sand of the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the remnant of them shall return. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Destruction is decreed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking in like a flood of judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For destruction, fixed and final, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts will accomplish <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the midst of all the earth. </p><h6>The Consolation of Zion: Assyria will assuredly fall</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For we, too, writhed in pangs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but we brought forth nothing but wind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We achieved for the land no deliverance; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the denizens of the world <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fell not (in battle) before us. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 By dismissal and exile alone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doth (the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ) contend with   her  : <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He has swept her away by His blast <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that blows fierce in the day of sirocco. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 On this condition therefore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall Israel’s guilt be forgiven – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When she puts away her sin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the issue thereof shall be this – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That all the stones of her altars <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she shall grind, like chalk, to powder; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that sacred poles and sun-pillars <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she never shall raise again. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For the fortified city is desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a homestead forsaken, forlorn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a pasture: there browses the calf – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there he lies, consuming the branches; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And there, when the dry boughs are broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come women who use them for fuel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the people would not reflect; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and so from their Maker they win no pity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no favour from their Creator. </p><h6>Warnings and Promises to Jerusalem</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="028001">28</span> Woe to the coronet proud of the drunkards of Ephraim! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to the fading flower of her glorious beauty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which crowns the heads of the men that are prostate with wine! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Therefore thus says the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behold! I am laying in Zion a stone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a tried and precious foundation stone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he that believeth shall not give way. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028017" id="028017" >17</span>
 And I will make justice the measuring-line, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and righteousness the plummet. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the refuge of lies shall swept by hail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the shelter deluged by water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028018" id="028018" >18</span>
 Your league with Death shall be clean disannulled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your compact with Sheol shall no wise stand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When the flood swept on, it will trample you down; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each time that it passes, ’twill bear you away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028019" id="028019" >19</span>
 It shall pass every morning – by day and by night – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the word, grasped at last, shall bring nothing but terror. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028020" id="028020" >20</span>
 For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out in, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cover too narrow to wrap himself round. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028021" id="028021" >21</span>
 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall rise as He rose on mount Perazim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blazing with wrath as in Gibeon’s vale, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to perform His task – that task so strange, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to accomplish His work – that work so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028022" id="028022" >22</span>
 Now scoff you no more, lest your bands become tighter; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for this have I heard from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a decree of destruction o’er all the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028023" id="028023" >23</span>
 Listen, and hear you my voice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attend and give ear to my speech. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028024" id="028024" >24</span>
 Doth the ploughman keep ploughing for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep opening and harrowing his ground? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028025" id="028025" >25</span>
 Doth he not, after levelling its surface, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scatter broadcast fennel and cummin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and plant there wheat and barley, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and, for its border, spelt? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028026" id="028026" >26</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  it is that has trained him aright, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his God it is that has taught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028027" id="028027" >27</span>
 Men thresh not fennel with sledges, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor are cart-wheels rolled over cummin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but fennel is threshed with a staff, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cummin with a flail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023028028" id="028028" >28</span>
 Do we ever crush bread-corn to pieces? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, we do not keep threshing for ever; </p><h6>The Fate of Jerusalem</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="029001">29</span> Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city where David encamped. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let one or two years pass by, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cycle of festivals more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029002" id="029002" >2</span>
 and distress I will bring upon Ariel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moaning and lamentation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and you shall be Ariel indeed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029003" id="029003" >3</span>
 I will camp, like David, against you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and circle there round with entrenchments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and set up forts against you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029004" id="029004" >4</span>
 And low from the ground shall you speak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your words from the dust shall rise humbly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with voice like a ghost’s from the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with twittering speech from the dust. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029005" id="029005" >5</span>
 But the horde of your foes shall become like fine dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the horde of the tyrants like flying chaff. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then swiftly and suddenly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts will visit you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with thunder and with earthquake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with din stupendous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with whirlwind and with tempest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and flame of devouring fire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029007" id="029007" >7</span>
 But the horde of all the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that fight against Ariel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with all their entrenchments and forts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all the hosts that distress her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be as a dream, as a vision of night. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029008" id="029008" >8</span>
 Like a man that is hungry, who dreams that he eats <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wakes to find his desire unappeased; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a man that is thirsty, who dreams that he drinks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wakes all faint, with his thirst unquenched: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so shall it be with the horde of all nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that fight against Mount Zion. </p><h6>The Spiritual Torpor and Religious Formality of the People</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Utterly dazed shall you be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly blind shall you be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and drunken, though not with wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reeling, though not with strong drink. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has poured upon you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a spirit of slumber deep; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the prophets, your eyes, He has sealed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the seers, your heads, He has covered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029011" id="029011" >11</span>
 so that the sight of all this is to you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the words on a scroll that is sealed. <br /><br /> If put into the hands of a scholar with the request that he read it, he will reply, ‟I cannot, it is sealed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023029012" id="029012" >12</span>
 If, however, it be put into the hands of a man who is no scholar, with the request that he read it, he will reply, ‟I cannot, I am no scholar.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029013" id="029013" >13</span>
 And the Lord said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because these people praise me with words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; honouring Me with their lips, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while their hearts are far away – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; their religion only a mockery, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formulate learned by rote – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029014" id="029014" >14</span>
 I will deal with them therefore once more <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a fashion so wondrous strange <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that their wise men’s wisdom shall perish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their prudent men’s prudence shall vanish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029015" id="029015" >15</span>
 Woe to them who conceal <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their deep designs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; doing their deeds in the dark, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unseen, unperceived – so they think! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 O perverse that you are! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the potter no more than the clay? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the thing that is made maintain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that it has not been made by its maker? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the thing that is fashioned deny <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the potter has understanding? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029017" id="029017" >17</span>
 Soon Lebanon’s forests will become an orchard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and orchards will be considered useless forest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029018" id="029018" >18</span>
 In that day even the deaf <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall hear words read from a scroll, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and out of the gloom and darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of the blind shall see. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029019" id="029019" >19</span>
 And then shall the humble win <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new joy in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the poorest shall exult <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Holy One of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Thus therefore says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the God of the household of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abraham’s redeemer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No longer will Jacob be ashamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer will faces grow pale with embarrasment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For the moment he beholds his children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what My hands have wrought in his midst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall count My name as holy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy One of Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they then shall count as holy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in awe hold the God of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023029024" id="029024" >24</span>
 Those that had erred in spirit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall then win understanding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and those that had grumbled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will willingly learn the truth. </p><h6>The Embassy to Egypt</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="030001">30</span> Ha! you refractory sons, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that follow a purpose I did not inspire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and that make an alliance that   I   did not sanction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thus heaping sin upon sin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 They start on their journey to Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without consulting Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to flee to the shelter of Pharaoh shall turn to your shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the shadow of Egypt shall prove your confusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 All of them laden with gifts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a people that cannot avail them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that brings no help or profit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but only disgrace and shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Now go and write it down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on a roll inscribe it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that it may be for the after-time, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a testimony for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For a rebel people are they, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sons that are utterly false, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sons that refuse to listen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the teaching of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023030010" id="030010" >10</span>
 That forbid the seers to see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the prophets to prophesy truth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟Speak to us smooth things,’ they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟And prophesy illusions. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 This therefore is the message <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Holy One of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟Because you reject this word, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and trust in guile and craft, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lean your weight thereon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023030013" id="030013" >13</span>
 This guilt of yours shall be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a rift in a lofty wall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that bulges, ready to fall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; till suddenly and swiftly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down it comes with a crash – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023030014" id="030014" >14</span>
 A crash like that of a pitcher <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so ruthlessly dashed in pieces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that not a shred can be found <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among the scattered fragments <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; wherewith to take fire from the heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or to draw from the cistern water.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And though the Lord may give unto you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scant measure of bread and scarceness of water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; yet your Teacher no more shall withdraw, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but your eyes shall behold your Teacher. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 With breadth like a rushing torrent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that reaches even to the neck, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to sift till the nations are sifted to nothing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to bridle their jaws and to lead them to ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023030029" id="030029" >29</span>
 Then a song you shall sing like the song <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the night of a holy festival; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and gladness of heart shall be yours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as is his, who, to sound of flute, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sets forth for the Mount of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to (worship) the Rock of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And each stroke of the rod of destiny, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lays upon him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; shall fall to the music of timbrel and lute; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with brandished arm shall He fight against them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For already a pyre is prepared, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constructed wide and deep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; piled high with blazing wood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fired by the breath of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as by a stream of brimstone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="031001">31</span> Woe to those that journey <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the land of Egypt for help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who rely on the throngs of her horses and chariots, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and trust in the eminent strength of her horsemen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but never turn their eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Holy One of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ask not the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  for counsel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031002" id="031002" >2</span>
 Yet He too is wise, and He brings disaster; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his threats He has not recalled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He will rise to contend with the household of miscreants, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with those whom the wicked would summon to help them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031003" id="031003" >3</span>
 The people of Egypt are men, not God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their horses are flesh, not spirit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  but stretch forth His hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the helper will stumble, the holpen will fall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and both shall perish together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031004" id="031004" >4</span>
 For thus has the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  declared to me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like as a lion growls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a young lion over his prey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; when against him the shepherds are summoned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to come in all their strength – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At the shout he is undismayed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at their noise he is nothing daunted – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts shall come down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to fight against Mount Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and against the hill thereof; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031005" id="031005" >5</span>
 Then like fluttering birds (shall they flee). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw His shield around Jerusalem; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he will shield her and deliver her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he will spare her and bring her to safety. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031006" id="031006" >6</span>
 O turn, you men of Israel, to Him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whom deeply you have offended. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031007" id="031007" >7</span>
 In that day each will disdain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gold and silver idols <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his guilty hands have made. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031008" id="031008" >8</span>
 Assyria shall fall by no mortal sword; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sword, but not man’s, shall devour him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the face of that sword he shall flee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his youths shall be put to task-work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023031009" id="031009" >9</span>
 In his fear he will flee past his rocky retreat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his princes shall run from the standard in panic. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  whose fire is in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose furnace is in Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="032001">32</span> Behold there cometh a King <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who shall rule in a spirit of justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and princes who govern with equity – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032002" id="032002" >2</span>
 Each like a shelter from the wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a refuge from storm of rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; or like streamlets of water in dry parched places, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or shade of great rock in a weary land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032003" id="032003" >3</span>
 Then the eyes that see shall not be sealed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the ears that hear shall not be heedless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032004" id="032004" >4</span>
 The mind of the rash shall judge with discernment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stammering tongue shall be fluent and plain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032005" id="032005" >5</span>
 No more shall a fool be called ‟noble,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more shall a knave be named ‟princely.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032006" id="032006" >6</span>
 For the fool speaks folly for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his mind evermore plots mischief; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; his doings are profane, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and error he speaks of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaves the hungry unsated, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and drink he withholds from the thirsty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032007" id="032007" >7</span>
 The tricks of the evil are vile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and villainies he plans – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To ruin the humble with lies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the poor, though his plea may be just. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032008" id="032008" >8</span>
 But the plans of the ‟noble’ are noble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by nobleness shall he endure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032009" id="032009" >9</span>
 You women that are at ease, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arise and hear my voice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you carelessly confident daughters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give ear to what I say. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032010" id="032010" >10</span>
 In little more than a year <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall shudder, for all your confidence; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the vintage shall surely fail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fruit shall not be garnered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032011" id="032011" >11</span>
 Tremble, you women at ease, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you that are confident, shudder; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; strip you, and make you bare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gird (sackcloth) upon your loins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032012" id="032012" >12</span>
 And beat upon your breasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in lament for the pleasant fields, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and for the fruitful vines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032013" id="032013" >13</span>
 And for the land of my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overgrown with thorns and briers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a house of mirth shall be left <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all the jubilant city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032014" id="032014" >14</span>
 The palace shall be forsaken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the thronging city deserted; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; watchtower and hill shall become <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an everlasting waste. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032015" id="032015" >15</span>
 But yet from the heavenly height <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall a spirit be poured upon us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the desert become like a garden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the garden be counted a forest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032016" id="032016" >16</span>
 Then justice shall dwell in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and righteousness live in the garden-land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023032017" id="032017" >17</span>
 Of justice the fruit shall be peace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the outcome of righteousness safety <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and quietness for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Forlorn are the highways, the wayfarer ceases. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He has broken the compact and mocked at its witnesses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly reckless of human kind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The earth mourns and languishes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lebanon withers in shame: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharon is now like a desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Bashan and Carmel are leafless. </p><h6>The Deliverance</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The sinners in Zion are filled with terror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shuddering seizes the souls profane. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟O who can dwell with devouring fire? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who cab dwell with eternal flame?’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Who walks in righteousness, speaks with honesty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scorns the gain that is won by oppression; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; whose hand refuses to clutch at a bribe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who stops his ears at a tale of blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who closes his eyes at the sight of evil: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023033016" id="033016" >16</span>
 He it is that shall dwell on impregnable heights. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On a fastness of rock shall his stronghold be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where his bread is provided, his water is sure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Look on the city of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the home of our festal assemblies; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a home of ease, a tent unremoved, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; whose pegs shall never be plucked from the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and not one of whose cords shall be snapped asunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ears of the deaf unstopped; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023035006" id="035006" >6</span>
 Then the lame shall leap like a hart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For waters break out in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and torrents in the wilderness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The parched land becomes a pool, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the thirsty land springs of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the haunts of (wild cats and of) jackals <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Your flocks and your herds) shall rest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the court (where the ostriches camp) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be filled with reeds and rushes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023035008" id="035008" >8</span>
 And there a pure highway shall rise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be called ‟The Holy Way’; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the unclean shall not pass over it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fools shall not wander therein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 No lion shall be there, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no ravenous beast shall ascend it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but there shall the ransomed walk, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yea, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s redeemed shall come home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023035010" id="035010" >10</span>
 They shall come unto Zion with singing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and crowned with unending joy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for at last joy and gladness have found them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sorrow and sighing are fled. </p><h6>Historical Appendix</h6><p></p><h6>First Narrative</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="036001">36</span> In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, after having assaulted and captured all the fortified cities of Judah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036002" id="036002" >2</span>
 despatched his Chief Officer from Lachish with a large force against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. Near the conduit of the upper pool, where he had taken up his position on the Fuller’s Field Road, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036005" id="036005" >5</span>
 he was visited by a deputation consisting of Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023036004" id="036004" >4</span>
 The Chief Officer began: ‟This is the message from the Great King, the King of Assyria: I desire 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036005" id="036005" >5</span>
 you to deliver it to Hezekiah. ’What sort of confidence is this that you cherish? Do you imagine that in war a mere word of the lips is the equivalent of wisdom and strength? Now who is it you are 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036006" id="036006" >6</span>
 trusting in, that you presume to rebel against me? Of course you are trusting to Egypt, that staff of broken reed, which will enter and piece the hand of the man that leans upon it: that is all that Pharaoh King of Egypt will prove to those who 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036007" id="036007" >7</span>
 trust to him. If, however, you tell me you are trusting to your God the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, why, that is the very god whose sanctuaries and altars Hezekiah has abolished, commanding the people of Judah and Jerusalem to confine their worship to the altar at this 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036008" id="036008" >8</span>
 place? Now, make a wager, if you like, with my lord the King of Assyria: I am prepared to furnish you with two thousand horses, if you on your part 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036009" id="036009" >9</span>
 can supply them with riders. (But if you cannot), how do you propose to repel the onset of one of the least of my lord’s officers? yet you trust to Egypt 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036010" id="036010" >10</span>
 for chariots and horsemen. And now do you imagine that I have not the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s sanction for invading this land with a view to its destruction? Why, it is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  Himself who commissioned me to invade this land and destroy it.’’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023036011" id="036011" >11</span>
 Thereupon Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked the Chief Officer to be good enough not to speak to them in Hebrew, in the hearing of the people on the wall, but in Aramaic, which they assured him 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036012" id="036012" >12</span>
 they understood. ‟Nay,’ replied the Officer, ‟it is not to your lord and yourself that my lord has sent me with this message, but precisely to the men on the wall, whom your policy is likely to reduce to eating their own filth and drinking their own water. ’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023036013" id="036013" >13</span>
 Then the Chief Officer came forward and cried aloud in Hebrew, ‟Listen to the words of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036014" id="036014" >14</span>
 Great King, the King of Assyria. Thus says the King: Do not let yourselves be imposed upon by 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036015" id="036015" >15</span>
 Hezekiah, for he is powerless to deliver you; and do not let yourselves be induced to trust to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  by Hezekiah’s assurances that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will unquestionably save you, and that this city will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036016" id="036016" >16</span>
 Give no heed to Hezekiah; for thus says the King of Assyria to you, Make your peace with me and surrender, and then everyone shall eat of his own vine and fig-tree, and drink water from his own 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036017" id="036017" >17</span>
 cistern, till I come and take you to a land like your own – a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036018" id="036018" >18</span>
 vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you with assurances that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will save you. Has the god of any nation ever rescued his land from the grasp 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036019" id="036019" >19</span>
 of the King of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods Sepharvain? And where are the gods of the land of Samaria? Have they rescued Samaria from 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036020" id="036020" >20</span>
 his grasp? Which of all these national gods has succeeded in rescuing his land from my grasp, that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  should now rescue Jerusalem from my 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036021" id="036021" >21</span>
 grasp?’ To this they answered not a word, they remained silent; for the King had expressly told 
<span class="verse" rel="v023036022" id="036022" >22</span>
 them not to answer him. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder, tore their garments, and returned to Hezekiah, telling him what the Chief Officer had said. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="037001">37</span> When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037002" id="037002" >2</span>
 into the Temple; and he despatched Eliakim, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037003" id="037003" >3</span>
 to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, to whom they spoke as follows: ‟A message from Hezekiah! This is a day of trouble, chastisement, and disgrace: for children are come to the birth, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037004" id="037004" >4</span>
 and there is not strength to bear them. But it may be that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God will hear the words of the Chief Officer, whom the King of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will punish the word which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God has heard: so lift up 
<span class="verse" rel="v0230375,6" id="0375,6" >5,6</span>
 your prayer for those that remain.’ And this was the answer that Isaiah returned to the deputation of King Hezekiah’s ministers: ‟Tell your master,’ he said, ‟that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message to him is this: he is not to be afraid of the blasphemous words he has heard from the minions of the King of Assyria. 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037007" id="037007" >7</span>
 ’ Behold,’ says He, ’I will inspire him with such a spirit (of panic) that on the strength of a rumour he will return to this own land, and there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall a victim to the sword.’’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023037008" id="037008" >8</span>
 Then the Chief Officer returned and found the King of Assyria engaged in the siege of Libnah, for he had heard that he had moved his camp from Lachish. 
<span class="verse" rel="v02303709a" id="03709a" >9a</span>
 When the news reached him that Tirhakah King of Ethiopia was advancing to give him battle … <br /><br /> So Sennacherib, King of Assyria, broke up camp and returned to Nineveh, where he settled. Subsequently, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch his god, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer. They, however, made good their escape to Armenia, and he was succeeded by Esar-haddon his son. </p><h6>Second Narrative</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02303709b" id="03709b" >9b</span>
 Then he sent messengers to Hezekiah with the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037010" id="037010" >10</span>
 following instructions. ‟This,’ said he, ‟is what you are to say to Hezekiah King of Judah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037011" id="037011" >11</span>
 Do not let the god you trust in delude you with his assurance that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. You are well aware of the ruin the King of Assyria has brought upon all lands, and are   you   to escape? 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037012" id="037012" >12</span>
 Were the nations which my father destroyed saved by their gods – Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037013" id="037013" >13</span>
 Edenites in Telassar? Where is the King of Hamath and the King of Arpad and the King of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023037014" id="037014" >14</span>
 Hezekiah received the letter at the hands of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037015" id="037015" >15</span>
 Temple and spread it before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and to 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037016" id="037016" >16</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  thus he prayed: ‟O the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts, You God is Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, You are God alone over all the kingdoms of the earth: You are the Creator of heaven and earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037017" id="037017" >17</span>
 Incline Thine ear, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and hear; open Thine eyes, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and see; and hear the message of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037018" id="037018" >18</span>
 the living God. True it is, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, that the Kings of Assyria have devoted all nations and 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037019" id="037019" >19</span>
 their lands to destruction, and thrust their gods in the fire, for no gods were they at all, but wood and stone, fashioned by human hands and so they were 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037020" id="037020" >20</span>
 destroyed. But now, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are God.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037021" id="037021" >21</span>
 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent this answer back to Hezekiah: ‟Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib, King of Assyria. 
<span class="verse" rel="v023037022" id="037022" >22</span>
 This is the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  concerning him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemns you and mocks you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; behind you Jerusalem’s daughter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is shaking her head. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037023" id="037023" >23</span>
 Against whom have you lifted your voice <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in reviling and blasphemy? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, your eyes you have lifted to heaven <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against Israel’s Holy One. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037024" id="037024" >24</span>
 You have reviled, by your minions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Lord, and have said, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟With my chariots I climb the high hills, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the recesses of Lebanon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; her towering cedars I fell, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and her cypresses choice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and I pierce to her furthest retreat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where the forest is thickest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037025" id="037025" >25</span>
 Wells, too, (in the desert) I dig, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I drink of strange waters; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with the sole of my foot I dry up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the Nile-streams of Egypt.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037026" id="037026" >26</span>
 Hast you not heard that all this <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I prepared long ago? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the old I had planned it, and now <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have brought it to pass: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So ’tis your to lay fortified cities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in desolate heaps. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037027" id="037027" >27</span>
 Their inhabitants, impotent all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are dismayed and confounded, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; become like the grass of the field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the green tender grass; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they are like unto grass on the roofs <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the east wind has blasted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037028" id="037028" >28</span>
 Your sitting and rising I know, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your going and coming; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037029" id="037029" >29</span>
 Your raging and uproar against Me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are come to Mine ears. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So My ring I will put through your nose <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and My bit in your lips, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and (thus led) I will make you return <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the way that you came. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037030" id="037030" >30</span>
 And the sign unto you shall be this: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This year you shall eat that which grows of itself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the next that which springs therefrom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but the third you shall sow and reap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plant vineyards and eat of their fruit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037031" id="037031" >31</span>
 And those that escape of the household of Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall again take root downward, and upward bear fruit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037032" id="037032" >32</span>
 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and forth from Mount Zion all such as escape. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The zeal of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall bring this thing to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037033" id="037033" >33</span>
 Therefore thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  concerning the King of Assyria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he shall not come into this city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor shoot an arrow there; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he shall not come before it with shield, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor cast up a mound against it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037034" id="037034" >34</span>
 But back he shall go by the way that he came, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and into this city he shall not enter; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023037035" id="037035" >35</span>
 For I will protect and deliver this city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Mine own sake and David My servant’s sake. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023037036" id="037036" >36</span>
 Then the angel of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  went forth and slew in the camp of Assyria one hundred and eighty-five thousand men: when they rose in the morning, behold! every man was a lifeless corpse. </p><h6>Hezekiah’s Sickness</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="038001">38</span> In those days Hezekiah was seized with a mortal sickness: and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said, ‟the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  commands you to set your household affairs in order; for you will 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038002" id="038002" >2</span>
 not recover, you are to die.’ Then, turning his face to the wall, Hezekiah offered this prayer to 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038003" id="038003" >3</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: ‟Remember, O the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I beseech You, how I have lived in Your presence with a faithful and undivided heart, and done the thing that pleased You.’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Then 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038004" id="038004" >4</span>
 there came to Isaiah this message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038005" id="038005" >5</span>
 ‟Go and say to Hezekiah: This says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of David your father, ’I will add to your life fifteen 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038006" id="038006" >6</span>
 years more. You and this city together I will rescue from the grasp of the King of Assyria, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038021" id="038021" >21</span>
 this city I will protect.’’ Then Isaiah said, ‟Let them take a cake of figs and press it on the boil, to 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038022" id="038022" >22</span>
 ensure his recovery.’ And Hezekiah said, ‟What is the sign that I shall yet go up to the Temple?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023038007" id="038007" >7</span>
 ‟Take this,’ he replied, ‟as a sign from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<span class="verse" rel="v023038008" id="038008" >8</span>
 that He will do what He has promised. Watch the shadow that the descending sun has cast on the step-clock of Ahaz: I will bring that shadow ten steps backward.’ and the sun did indeed go back on the step-clock the ten steps it had gone down. </p><h6>Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v023038009" id="038009" >9</span>
 A psalm of Hezekiah King of Judah, to celebrate his recovery from the sickness which had overtaken him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038010" id="038010" >10</span>
 Me thought I was doomed to depart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when my life was at noon-tide – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Consigned to the portals of Sheol <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rest of my years. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038011" id="038011" >11</span>
 I had thought to see Jah nevermore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the land of the living, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and never again to behold <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any man in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038012" id="038012" >12</span>
 Like the tent of a shepherd, my home <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is plucked up and stripped from me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he has rolled up my life like a web, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the thrum He has cut me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To pain I am doomed night and day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038013" id="038013" >13</span>
 And I cry till the morning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; while all my bones, like a lion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he crushes in pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038014" id="038014" >14</span>
 I scream as screams a swift, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a dove do I moan; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; mine eyes look tearfully heavenward: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O think on me, Lord, be my surety. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038015" id="038015" >15</span>
 What can I utter or say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since ’tis He has done it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I toss all the time of my slumber – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my soul is so bitter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038016" id="038016" >16</span>
 O rest You my spirit, refresh me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and let me recover. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038017" id="038017" >17</span>
 "Tis You that have kept my soul <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the pit of destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind Your back You have cast <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mine iniquities all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038018" id="038018" >18</span>
 For Sheol can give You no thanks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor can Death sing Your praises; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they that go down to the pit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot hope for Your love. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023038019" id="038019" >19</span>

 eunuchs to him with a present. Hezekiah, delighted, proceeded to display to them his treasure- house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, the armoury, and the whole range of his treasures: there was nothing in his place or indeed in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v023039003" id="039003" >3</span>
 Then came the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah and said, ‟Where do these men come from, and what have they said?’ ‟They have come,’ said Hezekiah, ‟from a distant land, from Babylon.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v023039004" id="039004" >4</span>
 ‟What have they seen in your palace?’ said Isaiah; and Hezekiah answered, ‟Everything: there is none of my treasures that I have not shown them.’

 ‟Listen, then,’ said Isaiah, ‟to the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>

 Sing a new song to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his praise form the end of the earth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let the sea and its fullness roar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the islands and those that dwell there. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042011" id="042011" >11</span>
 Let the desert rejoice with her cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the villages Kedar inhabits; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let Sela’s inhabitants sing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let them shout from the top of the mountains. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042012" id="042012" >12</span>
 Let them give to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  glory, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tell forth His praise in the islands. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042013" id="042013" >13</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  goes forth like a hero, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he stirs His rage like a warrior; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he shouts His fierce battle-cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he engages His foes like a hero. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042014" id="042014" >14</span>
 Long time have I held My peace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and restrained Myself in silence; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but now, like a woman in travail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I groan, I pant and gasp. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042015" id="042015" >15</span>
 Mountains and hills I will waste, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will dry up all their herbage; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the streams I will turn into sand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the pools I will clean dry up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042016" id="042016" >16</span>
 The blind I will lead and guide, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by ways and by paths unfamiliar; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; their gloom I will turn into light, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the ground that is rough I will level <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; these are the things I will do, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall not be left undone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042017" id="042017" >17</span>
 But those that put trust in an idol, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and call an image their god, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall backward be driven in shame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042018" id="042018" >18</span>
 Hearken. you that are deaf; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you blind, look up, that you see; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042019" id="042019" >19</span>
 Who is blind but My Servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and who is deaf as My Messenger? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is blind as Mine Envoy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the deaf as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s Servant? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042020" id="042020" >20</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023042021" id="042021" >21</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to make His instruction great and glorious. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042022" id="042022" >22</span>
 Yet it is still a people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plundered and despoiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all of them snared in dungeons, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hidden away in prisons – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A prey without prospect of rescue, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a spoil of which none says ‟Restore.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042023" id="042023" >23</span>
 Which of you now will give ear unto this, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will attend and hear for the time to come? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042024" id="042024" >24</span>
 Who gave up Jacob to plunderers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Israel to them that despoiled him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023042025" id="042025" >25</span>
 And poured His hot anger upon him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in fury of war so intense <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that it blazed round about him – he knew not why – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it burned him, yet never heart did he lay it? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="043001">43</span> But now – thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your Creator, O Jacob, your Maker, O Israel – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear not, for I have redeemed you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and called you by name: you are Mine. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043002" id="043002" >2</span>
 When you pass through waters, then I will be with you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no rivers shall bear you away in their flood: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When you walk through fire, you shall no wise be scorched, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the flames shall not kindle upon you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your Deliverer, Israel’s Holy One; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; egypt I give as your ransom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yea, Seba and Cush in your stead <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Because in My sight you are precious, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both honoured and beloved, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; those lands I will give as your ransom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those peoples in your stead. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043005" id="043005" >5</span>
 Therefore fear not, for I am with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will bring your seed from the sunrise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and gather you out of the sunset; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043006" id="043006" >6</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023043009" id="043009" >9</span>
 The nations are all assembled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the peoples are gathered together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of them all can declare such a thing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or announce to us such in advance? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them prove themselves right by the witness they bring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who shall say, when they hear, ‟It is true.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043010" id="043010" >10</span>
 But   you   are My Witnesses – thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my Servants, whom I have chosen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that they may acknowledge and trust Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and learn I am ever the same. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No god was formed before Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and after Me shall be none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 I, even I, am the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Saviour beside Me is none. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043012" id="043012" >12</span>
 It was I, and no strange god among you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who announced and declared and delivered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You are My witnesses – thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I am God from of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043013" id="043013" >13</span>
 From henceforth ever the same. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none that can snatch from My hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and who can reverse what I do? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your Redeemer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy One of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For your sake I send unto Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and down will I bring them in flight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will lay the Chaldeans low, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and turn their rejoicing to mourning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043015" id="043015" >15</span>
 For I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your Holy One, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Creator of Israel, your King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043016" id="043016" >16</span>
 Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who of old made a way through the Sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a path through the mighty waters; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043017" id="043017" >17</span>
 Who chariot and horse led forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the warriors and war-host together – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They lay down, but they rose no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were quenched and put out like a wick – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043018" id="043018" >18</span>
 Think of those old things no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor give heed to those deeds of the old time. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043019" id="043019" >19</span>
 For see! I am doing a new thing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; already it springs to view: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you not recognize it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, a path I will make through the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rivers in the wilderness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043020" id="043020" >20</span>
 The wild beasts shall render Me honour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the jackals and the ostriches. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For with water I dower the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wilderness with streams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to yield drink to My chosen people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043021" id="043021" >21</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023043022" id="043022" >22</span>
 Yet you have not called upon Me, O Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor wearied yourself about Me, O Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043023" id="043023" >23</span>
 You have not brought unto Me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burnt offerings of sheep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor did honour Me with your sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I burdened you not with offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor wearied you with frankincense; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043024" id="043024" >24</span>
 You brought Me no sweet cane with your money, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you sated Me not with the fat of your sacrifice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But you by your sins have burdened Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and through your transgressions have wearied Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043025" id="043025" >25</span>
 Yet I, even I, am He <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that blots out your transgressions; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your sins I remember no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Call to My mind your merits, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let us urge our several pleas; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; reckon up all that you canst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to prove yourself in the right. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043027" id="043027" >27</span>
 Thine ancient sire was a sinner, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your prophets were rebels against Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023043028" id="043028" >28</span>
 My Temple your princess profaned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so Jacob I gave to destruction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Israel to reviling. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="044001">44</span> Yet hear now, Jacob My Servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Israel, whom I have chosen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your Maker, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who formed you and helped you from birth: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear not, Jacob My Servant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jeshurun, whom I have chosen: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044003" id="044003" >3</span>
 For water I will pour on the thirsty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rills on the ground that is dry, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On your sons I will pour out My spirit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my blessing upon their offspring: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044004" id="044004" >4</span>
 And then shall they grow like the grass among waters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like willows by water-courses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044005" id="044005" >5</span>
 And one shall declare, ‟I belong to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>;’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another shall call himself Jacob: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Another shall write on his hand, ‟To the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And add to his own name the surname of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044006" id="044006" >6</span>
 Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the King of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his Redeemer, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the First, I too am the Last, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beside Me is no god at all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Who is like Me? Let him stand and proclaim <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and declare it and set it in order before Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has announced from of old things to come? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them tell us the things that shall yet come to pass. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044008" id="044008" >8</span>
 Be not disquieted, be not afraid: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have not I from the old time proclaimed and declared it? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You are my Witnesses: is there a God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a Rock beside Me at all? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044009" id="044009" >9</span>
 Makers of idols are all an illusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and profitless all are the idols they dote on; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no vision or insight have whose adore them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so in the end they shall come but to shame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044010" id="044010" >10</span>
 (The fool who believes) he has fashioned a god, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has but fashioned a profitless metal image. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044011" id="044011" >11</span>
 The magical arts are all put to shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the words of enchantment are only human. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The worshippers all, when they stand assembled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall tremble and come to confusion together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044012" id="044012" >12</span>
 The smiths prepare it over the coals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and into the shape that is fitting he hammers it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working it up with his sturdy arm. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then hunger comes over him – feeble he grows, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or faint, if so be that he drinks no water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044013" id="044013" >13</span>
 The carpenter stretches his measuring-line, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with s stylus he traces the shape of the image, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and carves it with tools human likeness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fair human likeness, to rest in a chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044014" id="044014" >14</span>
 Forth a man goes to cut himself timber; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the forest he chooses a plane or an oak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; which the Lord did plant, and the rain has nourished <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for men to make use of as fuel for kindling. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044015" id="044015" >15</span>
 He sets it ablaze and he warms himself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or he kindles a fire, and bakes bread; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; or he makes it into a god and bows down to it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fashions an image and falls down before it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044016" id="044016" >16</span>
 One half of the wood in the fire he burns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then he roasts flesh on the embers therefrom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; whereafter he eats the roast to his fill, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then he warms himself, and he says, ‟Ha! ha! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am warm, I feel the glow.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044017" id="044017" >17</span>
 The rest of it then he makes into a god – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to an image, and bows down prostate before it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He prays to it, and his prayer is this: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟Deliver you me, for you are my god.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044018" id="044018" >18</span>
 No insight has he, and no power of discernment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his eyes are besmeared, that he cannot see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his mind is sealed past understanding. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044019" id="044019" >19</span>
 He suffers never his thoughts to ponder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has not the sense or the insight to say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟One half thereof in the fire I have burned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bread I have baked on the embers therefrom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh I have roasted and eaten: and then <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the rest shall I make a detestable image, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bow myself down to a block of wood?’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023044020" id="044020" >20</span>
 Who takes delight in combustible idols <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is led far astray by delusion of heart: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He cannot deliver himself, and confess <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that his hand has been grasping an utter delusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Remember these things, O Jacob; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yea, Israel, for you are My Servant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I made you, My Servant are you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Israel, you must not renounce Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 That frustrates the omens of soothsayers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making diviners like fools, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; thrusting the wise to the background, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and turning their science to folly; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 But the words that   My   servants have spoken I confirm, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the purpose My messengers urge I fulfil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I say to Jerusalem, ‟You shall be peopled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 They crouch, they are bowed down together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unable to rescue their load, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they themselves are gone into captivity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046003" id="046003" >3</span>
 Hearken to Me, house of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you of Israel’s house that remain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all you that from birth have been carried <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upheld since the day you were born. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046004" id="046004" >4</span>
 Till old age I am ever the same; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till your hair is grey, I will carry you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is I that have borne the burden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is I that will carry it still; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is I that will carry and save you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046005" id="046005" >5</span>
 To whom will you liken or equal Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom will you set as My peer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 They that freely give gold from a purse <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that weigh in a balance the silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; hire a goldsmith to fashion a god of it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then they fall down and worship it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046007" id="046007" >7</span>
 They carry the load on their shoulder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and set it down on its base, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where it stands, in its place, unmoved. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It answers no man’s cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it saves no man in his trouble. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046008" id="046008" >8</span>
 Reflect, then, and own yourselves guilty; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you rebels, lay it to heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 From the first I declare the issue, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from ancient times things yet to be done; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I declare that My purpose shall stand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will execute all My pleasure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 I have called a wild bird from the sunrise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man of My purpose from a far distant land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will usher in what I promised, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and accomplish the thing that I planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v023046013" id="046013" >13</span>
 The triumph I bring you is near, not far, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my deliverance shall not tarry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set the deliverance in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lavish My glory on Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="047001">47</span> Come down, and sit in the dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o virgin daughter of Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sit on the ground unthroned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o daughter of the Chaldeans: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For you shall be called no more <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Tender and the Dainty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Let your nakedness be uncovered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and let your shame be seen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For vengeance I will take, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; irrevocable vengeance – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 True, I was wroth with My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my heritage I profaned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and I gave them into your hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you showed no pity upon them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you laid upon the aged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thine exceeding heavy yoke. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047007" id="047007" >7</span>
 You said, ‟I shall live for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and be Mistress evermore;’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; These things you did lay not heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor did think how it all would end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047008" id="047008" >8</span>
 Hear this now, Lady of pleasure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who sits so securely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and says in your heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟It is I, there is none beside me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall never sit as a widow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor know the loss of children.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047009" id="047009" >9</span>
 These two things shall come upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full swift in a single day – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The loss of your husband and children <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall suddenly come upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; despite your many spells, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despite your enchantments many, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047010" id="047010" >10</span>
 Despite your trust in your wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your fancy that no one can see you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold your wisdom and knowledge – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis they that have led you astray; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and you in your heart did say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‟It is I, there is none beside me.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047011" id="047011" >11</span>
 So disaster shall come upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which no knowledge of your can avert; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction shall fall upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which you have no power to appease; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sudden ruin shall come upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which you have no knowledge (to banish). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047012" id="047012" >12</span>
 Abide, then, by your enchantments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abide by your sorceries many, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherein you have toiled from your youth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance you may somewhat avail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perchance you may yet strike terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047013" id="047013" >13</span>
 You have wearied yourself with your counsellors; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now let them stand up and save you – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Those men that divide up the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directing their gaze to the stars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and month by month make known <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what things are coming upon you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047014" id="047014" >14</span>
 But see! they are all like stubble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fire burns them up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not even themselves can they save <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the mighty power of the flame: – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no glowing coal to warm at, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no fire to sit before. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023047015" id="047015" >15</span>
 Such then have they proved unto you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in whose cause you have toiled from your youth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; your flee staggering, each his own way – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a man of them all to save you. </p><h6>The New Prophecies will be Fulfilled as Surely as the Old</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="048001">48</span> Hear this, O household of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; called by the name of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sprung from the loins of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that swear by the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and celebrate Israel’s God – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but neither with justice or truth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023048002" id="048002" >2</span>
 For they call themselves after the Holy City, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lean on the God of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose name is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of Hosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023048003" id="048003" >3</span>
 Of old I announced predictions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and uttered them forth from My lips: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a sudden I wrought, and they came. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023048004" id="048004" >4</span>
 But I knew that you wast stubborn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a neck like an iron band, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a forehead all of brass; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023048005" id="048005" >5</span>
 So I told it you long ago: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere it came to pass, I informed you: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In case you should claim that your idol had wrought it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thine images – molten or graven – appointed it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023048006" id="048006" >6</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023046002" id="046002" >2</span>
 Like a sharp sword made He my mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the shadow of His hand did He hide me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he made me a polished shaft, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in His quiver He concealed me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046003" id="046003" >3</span>

 My God became my strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023046004" id="046004" >4</span>
 But I said, ‟I have laboured in vain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent my strength on an empty nothing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; yet safe is my cause with the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my recompense with my God.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And now – thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who formed me from birth for His Servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to bring Jacob back unto Him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that Israel to Him might be gathered – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 He grew like a sapling before us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a shoot out of ground that was dry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no beauty had he to attract us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="052001">52</span> No figure to win our regard; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 He was marred beyond human semblance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02305214c" id="05214c" >14c</span>

 He was spurned and forsaken of men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar with suffering and pain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as one from whom men hide their faces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was spurned and we heeded him not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023053004" id="053004" >4</span>
 But   ours   was the pain that   he   bore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sorrows he carried were ours; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; yet by   us   he was counted as smitten <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tortured by God’s own hand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023053005" id="053005" >5</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v023053007" id="053007" >7</span>
 Though outraged, he was submissive, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he opened not his mouth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or sheep that with shearers is dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023053008" id="053008" >8</span>
 He was dragged away by injustice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and who gave a thought to his fate? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He was torn from the land of the living, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and smitten to death for the sins that were ours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For this he shall win with the great an inheritance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he with the strong shall divide the spoil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because he had poured out his soul unto death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and had suffered himself to be numbered with rebels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; though the sins that he bore were the sins of the world, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and for those very rebels he had offered his prayer.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="054001">54</span> Sing, you barren, that did not bear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you that travailed not, break forth into singing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for more are the sons of the woman forlorn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the sons – says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – of her that is married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Of whom wast you then in such abject terror <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that you did play the traitor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and gave no thought to Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor did lay your duty to heart? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I hid Mine eyes in silence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Me you did not fear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057012" id="057012" >12</span>
 But I will expose your doings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this ‘righteousness’ of your. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057013" id="057013" >13</span>
 When you cry, your hateful idols <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall profit you nothing, nor save you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the wind shall lift them all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a breath shall take them away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But who trusts in Me shall possess the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and inherit My holy Mountain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057014" id="057014" >14</span>
 O raise, raise a highway, and clear you a path, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take the stumbling-blocks out of the way of My people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057015" id="057015" >15</span>
 For thus says He that is high and exalted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose throne is for ever, whose name is Holy: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘On high as the Holy One sit I enthroned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with him that is crushed, that is lowly in spirit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to quicken the spirit of them that are lowly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the heart of all such as crushed to revive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057016" id="057016" >16</span>
 For not for ever will I contend, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor cherish Mine anger evermore; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for then would the spirits faint before Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the souls that I Myself have made. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057017" id="057017" >17</span>
 Because of his sin I was worth for a moment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smote him in anger and hid My face: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But he kept to the way of his rebel heart – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057018" id="057018" >18</span>
 I have noted his ways,’ says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘But now will I bring to him healing and rest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and requite him with full consolation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057019" id="057019" >19</span>
 The lips of his mourners shall blossom with praise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when to far and to near I bring peace and prosperity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023057021" id="057021" >21</span>
 So peace there is none, says my God, to the wicked. </p><h6>Fasting</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="058001">58</span> Cry with full throat and refrain not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lift up your voice like a trumpet; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; declare to My people their sins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their guilt to the household of Jacob. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058002" id="058002" >2</span>
 Daily indeed they consult Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their joy is to learn My ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a nation that doeth the right <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and forsaken not the law of its God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They ask Me to guide then aright, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they delight to draw nigh unto God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058003" id="058003" >3</span>
 ‘Why look You not when we fast?’ (they say) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Why heed You not our self-chastening?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But on fast-days you think of your business, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you drive all your workmen like slaves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058004" id="058004" >4</span>
 See! you fast for strife and contention, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you smite the poor with your fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Such fasting as yours to-day <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not carry your prayers on high. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058005" id="058005" >5</span>
 Can such be the fast of My choice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a day for self-mortification? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To bow one’s head like a bulrush, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lie upon sackcloth and ashes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this what you call a fast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a day that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  accepts? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058006" id="058006" >6</span>
 Thus says the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the fast of My choice not this – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To loose the unjust fetters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to undo the bands of the yoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to let those that are crushed go free, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to snap each yoke in sunder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058007" id="058007" >7</span>
 To break your bread to the hungry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to bring the homeless home: – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When you see the naked, to cover him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to hide not yourself from your kinsmen? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058008" id="058008" >8</span>
 Then shall your light break forth as the dawn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your wounds shall be speedily healed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In front shall your righteousness march, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s own glory behind you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058009" id="058009" >9</span>
 Then, when you call, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall answer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and say, when you cry for help, ‘Here am I.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If from your midst you remove the yoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the finger of scorn and the speech that is mischievous; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058010" id="058010" >10</span>
 If to the hungry you give your bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the soul that is bowed you dost satisfy: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in the darkness your light shall arise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your gloom shall be as the noonday: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058011" id="058011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall guide you for evermore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your soul in the land that is parched He will satisfy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your strength He will make new again, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you like a well-watered garden shall be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a fountain of water, whose waters fail not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058012" id="058012" >12</span>
 The ancient ruins your sons shall rebuild, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall rear once again the foundations of old; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and you shall be called the Repairer of Ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who makes waste places a home again. </p><h6>The Sabbath</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058013" id="058013" >13</span>
 If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from doing your business on My holy day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and calls the Sabbath a sheer delight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the holy (day) of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  honourable, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and honours it by not doing your wont, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor heeding your business, nor speaking idly: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023058014" id="058014" >14</span>
 Then shall you have your delight in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and over the heights of the earth shall you ride; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you the portion of Jacob your father <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in full to enjoy, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has promised. </p><h6>The Sins</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="059001">59</span> Behold, the hands of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not too short to save, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor His ear too dull to hear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059002" id="059002" >2</span>
 Your iniquities are the barrier <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between your God and you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; your sins have hidden His face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and therefore He will not hear you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059003" id="059003" >3</span>
 For your hands are stained with blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your fingers with iniquity; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; your lips have uttered falsehood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your tongue mutters depravity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059004" id="059004" >4</span>
 No one sues the integrity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one with honesty pleads; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they trust in pretence and lies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceive trouble and bring forth mischief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059005" id="059005" >5</span>
 Basilisks’ eggs they hatch, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and spiders’ webs they weave: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who eats their eggs shall die, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the egg that is crushed breaks out as a viper. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059006" id="059006" >6</span>
 Their webs cannot serve as a garment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with that which they fabricate no man can clothe himself; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for evil is what they fabricate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hands work deeds of violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059007" id="059007" >7</span>
 Their feet run to evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they haste to shed innocent blood; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; their thoughts are thoughts of mischief, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their paths are Wreck and Ruin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059008" id="059008" >8</span>
 The ways of peace they know not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no justice is in their tracks: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For their own selfish ends they have twisted their paths; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who treads thereon is a stranger to peace. </p><h6>The Confession</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059009" id="059009" >9</span>
 For this cause our right remains far, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and no victory yet overtakes us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; we look for the light, but lo! darkness – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for brightness, but walk in the gloom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059010" id="059010" >10</span>
 We grope, like the blind, by the wall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yea, like men that are sightless we grope; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; we stumble at noon as in twilight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in darkness we dwell like the dead. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059011" id="059011" >11</span>
 We all of us roar like bears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like doves we sadly mourn; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; we look – but in vain – for justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; salvation is far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059012" id="059012" >12</span>
 Our transgressions before You are many, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our sins do witness against us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; our transgressions are ever with us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we know our iniquities well – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059013" id="059013" >13</span>
 Rebellion, denial of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and turning away from our God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking revolt and perverseness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and uttering lies from the heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059014" id="059014" >14</span>
 Justice is driven back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and righteousness stands afar; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in the market-place truth stumbles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rectitude cannot enter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059015" id="059015" >15</span>
 So truth is not to be found, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and insight departs from the city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sight was the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  displeased, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was angry that justice was lacking. </p><h6>The Deliverance</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059016" id="059016" >16</span>
 He saw with utter amaze <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a man to interpose; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so His own arm wrought Him deliverance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his righteous might upheld Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059017" id="059017" >17</span>
 He put on the breastplate of righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on His head the helm of salvation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he put on the garments of vengeance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the mantle of passion He clothed Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059018" id="059018" >18</span>
 He renders recompense matching desert – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrath to His enemies, shame to His foes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059019" id="059019" >19</span>
 So shall those in the west fear the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those at the sunrise behold His glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall come like a pent-up stream, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which the breath of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  drives. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059020" id="059020" >20</span>
 But to Zion He comes as Redeemer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and removes transgressors from Jacob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023059021" id="059021" >21</span>
 This covenant with them I make, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit that is upon you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the words I have put in your mouth – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not depart form your mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor from the mouth of your children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; nor yet from the mouth of your children’s children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, from the henceforth and evermore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="060001">60</span> Arise, shine, for your light is now come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on   you   is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s own glory arisen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060002" id="060002" >2</span>
 For, though darkness covers the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the nations are wrapped in gloom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; yet on   you   the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shines forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over   you   His glory appears. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060003" id="060003" >3</span>
 And nations shall come to the light that   you   shed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and kings to the brightness that streams from   you  . <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060004" id="060004" >4</span>
 Lift up your eyes round bout and behold <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how they flock to you, all of them gathered together – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sons coming in from afar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the arms of their nurses your daughters. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060005" id="060005" >5</span>
 At the sight of them you shall be radiant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your heart shall tremble and throb; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the wealth of the sea shall be turned unto you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unto you shall the nations come in with their treasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060006" id="060006" >6</span>
 A stream of camels shall cover you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young camels of Midian and Ephah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all those of Sheba shall come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laden with gold and frankincense, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tell of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s renown. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060007" id="060007" >7</span>
 All the flocks of Kedar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall gather unto you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the rams of Nebaioth shall seek you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall mount with acceptance Mine altar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my House of Prayer shall be radiant with beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060008" id="060008" >8</span>
 Who are these that fly like a cloud, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or like doves to their latticed cotes? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060009" id="060009" >9</span>
 For ships unto Me are gathering – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vessels of Tarshish in front – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring your sons from afar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with them their silver and gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Holy One of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because He has girt you with glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060010" id="060010" >10</span>
 Strangers shall build your walls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their kings unto you shall be ministers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the wrath that moved Me to smite you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is turned into favour and pity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060011" id="060011" >11</span>
 Your gates shall ever be open, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not shut by day or nigh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that the wealth of nations be brought you – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their kings at the head of the train. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060012" id="060012" >12</span>
 For the nation and the kingdom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that serve you not shall perish: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, utterly waste shall those nations be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060013" id="060013" >13</span>
 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pine-tree, the plane, and the cypress together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that the House where My holiness dwells may be fair, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the place where I walk may be covered with glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060014" id="060014" >14</span>
 The sons of those that afflicted and scorned you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall come unto you, all lowly bending, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and give you the name of ‘the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s own City, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Zion of Israel’s Holy One.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060015" id="060015" >15</span>
 Whereas you have been forsaken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unvisited, abhorred, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; an eternal pride I make you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a joy unto all generations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060016" id="060016" >16</span>
 You shall suck the milk of nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yea, royal breasts shall you suck; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and then shall you know that I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, am your Saviour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and He that redeems you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the Mighty One of Jacob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060017" id="060017" >17</span>
 For brass I will bring in gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and silver instead of iron, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; brass in the place of wood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and iron in place of stones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and Peace I will set to govern you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Justice to be your lord. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060018" id="060018" >18</span>
 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor rapine nor ruin within your borders; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but a Sure Defence you shall call your walls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your gates you shall name Renown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060019" id="060019" >19</span>
 The sin shall no more be your light by day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor yet shall the moon shed her brightness upon you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall be your eternal Light, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your God shall be your glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060020" id="060020" >20</span>
 Your sun shall set no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your moon shall wane no more; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall be your eternal Light, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the days if your grief shall be ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060021" id="060021" >21</span>
 Your people shall all be righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessing the land for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the shoot of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s planting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the work of His hands, for His glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023060022" id="060022" >22</span>

 ‘Surely My people are they,’ He said, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Sons that will not prove false.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And so He became their Saviour <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from all that did distress them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023063009" id="063009" >9</span>
 No envoy was it or angel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but His own very presence that saved them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In His love and in His pity <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did Himself redeem them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he took them up and carried them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the days of old. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v023065015" id="065015" >15</span>
 Behold, you shall leave your name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for My Chosen to curse by: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, by a far other name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall My Servants be called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065016" id="065016" >16</span>
 He that prays in the land for a blessing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall appeal to the God of truth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and he that swears in the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall swear by the God of truth – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When the former distress is forgotten <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hidden from Mine eyes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065017" id="065017" >17</span>
 For behold I will soon create <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the heavens and the earth anew. </p><h6>The Glorious Future</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The past shall not be remembered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor come into mind again; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065018" id="065018" >18</span>
 But men shall for ever rejoice and exult <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over this My (new) creation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For behold! I will straightway create <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jerusalem a rejoicing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and her people an exultation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065019" id="065019" >19</span>
 For I will exult in Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in My people rejoice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No more shall be heard within her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the voice of weeping or crying; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065020" id="065020" >20</span>
 No more shall be found therein <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a babe of (a few brief) days, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; or an old man who has not completed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the full tale of his days; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but he that dies the youngest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall have lived for a hundred years, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and he that dies less than a hundred <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be counted a man accursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065021" id="065021" >21</span>
 They shall dwell in the homes they have built, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eat the fruit of the vines they have planted; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065022" id="065022" >22</span>
 No others shall dwell in the homes your have built, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor shall others enjoy what they planted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the days of My folk shall be many <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the days of the life of a tree, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the work that their hands have achieved <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall My Chosen enjoy to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065023" id="065023" >23</span>
 They shall not labour in vain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor rear their children to perish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for a race that is blest of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  are they, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their offspring shall live by their side. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065024" id="065024" >24</span>
 I will answer or ever they call, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will hearken while still they are speaking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023065025" id="065025" >25</span>
 The wolf and the lamb shall then pasture together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the lion eat straw like the ox: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the serpent – its food shall be dust. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; None shall do hurt, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, or havoc, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on all My holy Mountain. </p><h6>Doom Pronounced upon those who Purpose to Build a Rival Temple</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="066001">66</span> Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; what manner of house would you build Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What manner of home would you rear? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066002" id="066002" >2</span>
 For all this is the work of My hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and these things are all Mine, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is the man I regard – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the afflicted and broken in spirit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who trembles at My word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066003" id="066003" >3</span>
 Oxen they kill forsooth – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but men they also slay; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and sheep they sacrifice – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but dogs they also strangle: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They offer their oblations – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but also the blood of swine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they bring their memorial incense, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but they also bless the idol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Such are the ways   they   have chosen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foul rites are the joy of their soul; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066004" id="066004" >4</span>
 So   I   choose that   they   shall be harassed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that they dread I will bring on them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, when I called, none responded; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they listened not, when I spoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but did that which was vile in My sight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and made choice of the things that displeased Me. </p><h6>The Faithful Cheered by the Prospect of Zion’s Prosperity</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066005" id="066005" >5</span>
 Hear you the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you that at   His   word tremble: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your brethren, that hate you and loathe you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for My name’s sake, have said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Let the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  show forth His glory <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we too may look on your joy:’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But   they   shall put to shame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066006" id="066006" >6</span>
 Hark! from the City an uproar. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! from the Temple it cometh. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! ’tis the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  Himself <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dealing recompense unto His foes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066007" id="066007" >7</span>
 But   she   has brought forth a son <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before her hour of travail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; before her pains came upon her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a man-child was she delivered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066008" id="066008" >8</span>
 Who has heard the like? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has seen aught like this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it be that a single day <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may see the birth of a people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that a nation be born all at once? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For no sooner had Zion travailed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than she brought her sons to the birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066009" id="066009" >9</span>
 Shall   I   not help to bring forth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what I bring to the birth, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or shall I, having brought to the birth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then close up the womb, says your God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066010" id="066010" >10</span>
 O Jerusalem, rejoice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and exult in her, all you that love her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Be joyful with her exceedingly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all you that mourned over her; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066011" id="066011" >11</span>
 That so you may suck to the full <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the breasts of her consolations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and drain to your heart’s delight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the milk of her rich mother-bosom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066012" id="066012" >12</span>
 For thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set prosperity flowing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; towards her, like a river in spate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the wealth of the world like a torrent. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your babes shall be borne on the side <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and dandled upon the knees; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066013" id="066013" >13</span>
 And as one whom his mother comforts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so will I comfort you: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jerusalem you shall be comforted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066014" id="066014" >14</span>
 Your heart shall rejoice at the sight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your bones shall flourish like grass; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and then shall men perceive <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  loves His Servants, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how wroth He can be with His foes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066015" id="066015" >15</span>
 For behold, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  shall come like a fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with chariots like the whirlwind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to render His anger in burning heat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his rebuke in flames of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066016" id="066016" >16</span>
 For judgment the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will hold on all flesh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by fire and by His sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s slain shall be many. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066017" id="066017" >17</span>
 Those that devote themselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by rites of purification <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to (worship in sacred) gardens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with one in the centre to lead them – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That eat the flesh of swine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of creatures that crawl, and mice – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066018" id="066018" >18</span>
 Their works and their thoughts, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall come to an end together. </p><h6>The Lord’s Glory Announced throughout the World: The Complete Restoration and Perpetuity of Israel</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, the time is come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to gather all nations and tongues; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall come and behold My glory, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066019" id="066019" >19</span>
 And a sign I will set among them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And those that escape (the judgment) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will send unto distant coasts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; such as have not heard of My fame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor yet have seen My glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall tell to the nations My glory; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066020" id="066020" >20</span>
 And out of all the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they shall all your brethren bring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; unto My holy Mountain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to Jerusalem, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as an offering unto the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the offerings brought to the Temple <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Israel in vessels pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066021" id="066021" >21</span>
 Some I will also take, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Levitical priests, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066022" id="066022" >22</span>
 For as surely as the heavens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the earth I create anew <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; shall abide, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, before Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your name and your race shall continue. </p><h6>The Fearful Fate of the Apostates</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066023" id="066023" >23</span>
 From one new moon to another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one Sabbath to another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; shall all flesh come to worship <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before Me, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v023066024" id="066024" >24</span>
 And forth they shall go, and look <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the corpses of the men <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that have rebelled against Me – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose worm never dies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose fire is never quenched: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are held by all flesh in abhorrence.
