<span class="verse" rel="v027001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  handed King Jehoiakim over to him, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them off to the land of Shinar to the temple of his god, and placed them in the temple treasury. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The king commanded Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring to him some of the Israelite princes and nobles. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 They were to be young men who were without physical defect and handsome, comfortable with all types of knowledge, well taught and quick to learn and able to serve in the king’s palace. They were to be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 The king gave to them each day some of his rich food and some of the wine which he drank. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 He also commanded that they should be taught for three years, and that at the end of that time they should enter the royal service. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Among these young men were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah; 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 but the chief of the king’s eunuchs gave other names to them. To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abednego. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 But Daniel made up his mind not to become ritually unclean by being contaminated by the rich food of the king nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked the chief of the king’s eunuchs to help him avoid it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 God helped Daniel to win the kindness and favor of the chief. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, ‘I fear that my lord, the king, who has given you your food and your drink, will see that your faces are sadder than those of young men who are your own age, and so you will endanger my head with the king.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 So Daniel went to the guardian whom the chief of the eunuchs had put over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and said 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 ‘Test us for ten days; and let us have vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Then compare the way we look with that of the young men who eat of the king’s rich food. Then do to us as seems best.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 So he did as they asked and tested them for ten days. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 At the end of ten days they looked better and they were healthier than all the young men who ate the king’s rich food. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 So the guardian took away their rich food and the wine and gave them vegetables. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 To these four young men God gave knowledge, learning, and wisdom; and Daniel understood all kinds of visions and dreams. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 On the date which the king had fixed for introducing all the young men to the court, the chief of his eunuchs brought them to Nebuchadnezzar, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 and the king talked with them. But not one of all the young men was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve the king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 On every subject which called for wisdom and understanding and about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the wise men and magicians who were in his entire kingdom. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 Daniel remained at the court until the start of the reign of King Cyrus. </p><h6>A king’s strange dream</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Nebuchadnezzar in the second year of his reign had dreams, and his mind was so troubled that he could not sleep. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Then the king sent for the magicians and the wise men, and the Chaldaens (who studied the stars) to tell him what his dreams meant. So they came in before the king, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 and he said to them, ‘I have had a dream and my mind is troubled, for I want to know what the dream means.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Then those who studied the stars said to the king in Aramaic: ‘O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will tell you what it means.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 The king answered, ‘What I now say is certain: if you do not tell me the dream and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be maderuins. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 But if you tell the dream and what it means, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honors; therefore tell me the dream and what it means.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 They answered the second time, ‘Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will tell what it means.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 The king replied, ‘I see clearly that you wish to gain time, for you know that what I have said is certain, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 and that if you do not tell the dream to me, you will all suffer the same punishment. So you have planned to speak lying and false words before me, until the time when it is to happen has passed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me what it means.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 The Chaldeans answered the king, ‘There is no man on earth who can do what the king asks, for no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any wise man or magician, or of one who studies the stars. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 What the king asks is too hard. There is no one else who can tell it to the king, except the gods, who do not live among mortals.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 This made the king very angry and he ordered all the wise men of Babylon put to death. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 So the command was given that the wise men were to be put to death. Search was made for Daniel and his friends that they too might be put to death. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Then Daniel approached Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to put the wise men of Babylon to death, and quietly and carefully asked, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 ‘Why is the king’s command so harsh?’ When Arioch told Daniel the facts, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 he went to the king and asked that he give him time to tell what the dream meant. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Then Daniel went to his house and told the facts to his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, so that they might beg the God of heaven to be kind to them and to tell Daniel this secret, so that they might not die with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Then the secret was told to Daniel in a vision at night, and he praised the God of heaven and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v027002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 ‘Blessed be the name of God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from everlasting to everlasting! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For wisdom and power are his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v027002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 He controls the seasons and times, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he removes and installs kings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He gives wisdom to the wise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and knowledge to those who have insight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v027002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 He shows the deep, secret things; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he knows what is in the darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the light of truth dwells in him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v027002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 God of my fathers: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give you thanks and praise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For you gave me wisdom and strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and havemade known the things we asked; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You have made known to us the king’s secret!’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had commanded to kill the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, ‘Do not kill the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel to the king and said to him, ‘I have found a man among the captives from Judah who will tell you what this dream means.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 The king said to Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar), ‘Can you make known to me the dream which I have had and what it means?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 Daniel answered, ‘The secret which the king asks is something that neither wise men, magicians, nor those who study the stars can make known to him; 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 but there is a God in heaven who tells secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will come in the future. Your dream and the visions which you had as you lay asleep are these: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 ‘The thoughts which came into your mind on your bed concerned what will happen in the future. The one who reveals secrets has made known to you what will come to pass. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 This secret was not revealed to me because I am wiser than other living people, but so that the king might learn the interpretation: so that you might understand the thoughts that have come to you. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 ‘You, O king, had a vision and saw a great image. That image was large and it was exceedingly bright as it stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 The head of the image was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its body and its thighs of bronze, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002033" id="002033" >33</span>
 its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002034" id="002034" >34</span>
 You looked at it until a stone was cut out, not by human hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002035" id="002035" >35</span>
 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff which blows from the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away so that nothing was left of them. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the earth. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002036" id="002036" >36</span>
 ‘This is the dream, and we will tell the king what it means: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002037" id="002037" >37</span>
 O king, you are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the rule, the power, the strength, and the glory. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002038" id="002038" >38</span>
 Over the whole world he has given into your power, people, the wild beasts and the birds, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002039" id="002039" >39</span>
 ‘After you will rise another kingdom not so strong as you are, and a third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over the whole earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002040" id="002040" >40</span>
 A fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, for iron breaks in pieces and shatters all things, and like iron which crushes, it will break in pieces and crush all things. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002041" id="002041" >41</span>
 As you saw the feet and toes, part clay and part iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it some of the strength of the iron, for you saw the iron mixed with clay. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002042" id="002042" >42</span>
 As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly broken. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002043" id="002043" >43</span>
 You saw the iron mixed with clay, for the ruling families will arrange marriage alliances between each other, but they will not stick together, just as iron does not stick to clay. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002044" id="002044" >44</span>
 ‘During the reigns of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will the power be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and destroy all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002045" id="002045" >45</span>
 This is shown by the fact that you saw a stone cut out of the mountain, but not with human hands<>. It broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. <br /><br /> ‘The great God has made known to the king what is to come, and the dream is real and this meaning true.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027002046" id="002046" >46</span>
 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and ordered that a sacrifice and sweet odors should be offered to him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002047" id="002047" >47</span>
 The king also said to Daniel, ‘Your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and one who tells his secrets to his servant, for you have been able to tell this great secret.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002048" id="002048" >48</span>
 Then the king gave Daniel a high position and many costly gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief over all the wise men in Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027002049" id="002049" >49</span>
 But at Daniel’s request the king placed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the province of Babylon; while Daniel stayed in the king’s court. </p><h6>The test by fire</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Nebuchadnezzar, the king, made a statue of gold ninety feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Then he sent for the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 So the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces all came together for the dedication and stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Then the herald cried aloud, ‘To you it is commanded, peoples, nations: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 The moment you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you must fall down and worship the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 So when all the people heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and the speakers of all languages fell down and worshipped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 But at that time certain Chaldeans came near to the king and made this accusation against the Jews: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 ‘O king, live forever! O king, you have commanded that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble must fall down and worship the golden statue, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 There are certain Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, whom you have placed in charge of the province of Babylon. These men, O king, have not obeyed your command; they do not serve your gods nor worship the golden statue which you have set up.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury gave command to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 When they were brought before the king, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, ‘Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my god nor worship the golden statue which I have set up? 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 If you are now ready, as soon as you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, to fall down and worship the statue which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you will at once be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace. Where is there a god who can deliver you out of my hands?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, ‘O king, there is no need of our answering you about this. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 Our God whom we serve is able to save us from the burning, fiery furnace; he will save us out of your hand, O king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 But if not, know, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry and the appearance of his face changed, as he looked at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 He also commanded certain strong men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and throw them into the burning, fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their robes, and their other garments, and were thrown into the burning, fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 As the king’s command was urgent and the furnace very hot, the flames destroyed the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the midst of the burning, fiery furnace. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was so astonished that he rose up hastily and said to his counsellors, ‘Did we not throw three men, bound, into the fire?’ They answered, ‘True, O king.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 He said, ‘Now I see four men, unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unhurt, and the fourth looks like a god.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the door of the burning, fiery furnace and said, ‘Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out.’ Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003027" id="003027" >27</span>
 The officers, governors, and counsellors who were there saw that the fire had no power over the bodies of these men, and that the hair of their heads was not singed and that their cloaks were not harmed, and that there was no smell of fire. And 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003028" id="003028" >28</span>
 Nebuchadnezzar said, ‘Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel to save his servants who trusted in him and refused to obey the king’s command and have offered their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003029" id="003029" >29</span>
 Therefore I command that every people, nation, and speaker of every language that says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut in pieces and their house will be made a ruin, for there is no other god who is so able to save as is this one.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027003030" id="003030" >30</span>
 Then the king gave high positions, in the province of Babylon, to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. </p><h6>The king’s madness</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May your peace be great. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 How great are his signs! And how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rule lasts from generation to generation. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and prosperous in my palace. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 I saw a dream that made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told the dream to them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 But at last there came before me Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream to him: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 ‘Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the secret visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 The tree grew and was strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it could be seen to the end of the earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; the animals of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens nested in its branches, and every kind of living being was fed from it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 I saw in the visions of my head on my bed a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 He cried aloud, “Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the animals get away from under it, and the birds from its branches. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, with a band of iron and bronze; bound with iron and bronze he will be fed with the grass of the field, and wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion will be with the animals. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 His mind will be changed so that it will not be that of a man, and an animals’s mind will be given to him, and seven times will pass over him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the affair by the word of the holy ones, that the living may know that the Most High rules over human kingdoms of gives them to whoever he will, and can set up as ruler the humblest of people. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, O Belteshazzar, must declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dumfounded for a moment, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, ‘Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation trouble you.’ Belteshazzar answered, ‘My lord, I wish the dream applied to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries! 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 The tree which you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 whose leaves were fair, and whose fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which the animals sheltered, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their nests, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004022" id="004022" >22</span>
 is you, O king – you who are great and strong; and your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004023" id="004023" >23</span>
 You saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, and saying. Hew down the tree and destroy it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004024" id="004024" >24</span>
 This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004025" id="004025" >25</span>
 You will be driven from people, and your dwelling will be with the animals of the field, and you will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he will. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004026" id="004026" >26</span>
 And as they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, so your kingdom will be secure to you as soon as you recognize that the heavens do rule. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004027" id="004027" >27</span>
 Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteous works, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; then perhaps there may be a continuation of your prosperity.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027004028" id="004028" >28</span>
 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004029" id="004029" >29</span>
 At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004030" id="004030" >30</span>
 The king said, ‘Is not this great Babylon which I have built for a residence, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004031" id="004031" >31</span>
 While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven: ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has passed away from you, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004032" id="004032" >32</span>
 and you will be driven from people, and your home will be with the animals of the field; you will be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whom he will.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004033" id="004033" >33</span>
 The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from people, and ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles” feathers and his nails like birds” claws. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027004034" id="004034" >34</span>
 At the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom lasts generation to generation; 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004025" id="004025" >25</span>
 and all the inhabitants of the earth are considered as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and no oone can stay his hand, or say to him. What are you doing? 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004036" id="004036" >36</span>
 At that same time my reason returned to me, and for the sake of my royal honor, my majesty and my kingly appearance were restored to me. Then my counsellors and my nobles sought eagerly for me; and I was established in my kingdom, and still greater power was added to me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027004037" id="004037" >37</span>
 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble. </p><h6>The handwriting on the wall</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Belshazzar, the king, made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine before them all. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Under the influence of wine, he gave command to bring the gold and silver utensils which his father, Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the temple at Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines might drink from them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 So they brought the golden vessels which were taken from the temple of God which was at Jerusalem. The king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines drank from them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote opposite the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Then the king grew pale, and fear filled his mind, his legs trembled and his knees knocked together. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 He called for the magicians and the Chaldeans (who study the stars) and said to the wise men of Babylon, ‘Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold about his neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing nor tell the king what it meant. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 So King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face grew pale, and his nobles were thrown into confusion. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Now the queen, because of what the king and his nobles had said, came into the banquet-house and said, ‘O king, live forever; let not your thoughts trouble you nor let yourself grow pale. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the days of your father he was found to have light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, put him in charge of all the magicians, Chaldeans and those who study the stars. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 for an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, the interpreting of dreams and explaining of riddles and the solving of difficulties were found in this same Daniel, whose name the king changed to Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will tell what it means.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 So Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king said to him, ‘Are you that Daniel, one of the men who were carried away captive, whom the king, my father, brought from Judah? 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have understanding and great wisdom. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 The wise men and the magicians have been brought in before me to read this writing and to tell what it means; but they are not able. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 I have heard that you can tell what dreams mean and answer hard questions. Now if you can read the writing and tell what it means, you will be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about your neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 Then Daniel answered the king, ‘Keep your gifts and give your rewards to another. Without them I will read the writing to the king, and tell what it means. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar, your father, the kingdom and power, glory and majesty. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 Because of the power that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and races trembled and feared him. He killed or kept alive as he wished; and he raised up or put down whom he pleased. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 But when he became proud and haughty, he was made to come down from his kingly throne and his glory was taken from him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005021" id="005021" >21</span>
 and he was driven away from men, and his mind became like that of the beasts, and he lived with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over the realm of humanity and that he sets up over it whom he will. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005022" id="005022" >22</span>
 ‘But you, his son Belshazzar, have not been humble, though you knew all this, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005023" id="005023" >23</span>
 but you have raised yourself against the Lord of heaven, and have had the utensils of his temple brought before you, and you, your nobles, your wives, and the others of your household have drunk wine from them. You have given praise to the gods of silver, of gold, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which cannot see nor hear nor know; and you have not praised the God in whose control are your very breath and all that you do.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005024" id="005024" >24</span>
 ‘Then the hand was sent out before him and traced this writing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v027005025" id="005025" >25</span>
 MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005026" id="005026" >26</span>
 ‘This is what it means: Mene: God has numbered the days your kingdom and brought it to an end. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005027" id="005027" >27</span>
 Tekel: you are weighed in the scales and found wanting. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005028" id="005028" >28</span>
 Upharsin: your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027005029" id="005029" >29</span>
 Then at Belshazzar’s command Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold was put about his neck, and he was proclaimed the third ruler in the kingdom. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005030" id="005030" >30</span>
 But on that very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027005031" id="005031" >31</span>
 and Darius, the Mede, who was sixty-two years old, received the kingdom. </p><h6>Daniel in the lions” den</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty officers who ruled the whole kingdom, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 and over them three chief officials, of whom Daniel was one, so that these officers might report to them and that the king should lose nothing. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 Daniel was better than the other chief officials and the officers, for he had a fine spirit; and the king intended to set him over the whole empire. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 Then the chief officials and the officers tried to find a way to accuse Daniel of not having done his duty, but they could not find anything against him, for he was faithful and was not guilty of any mistake or wrong-doing. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 Then these men said, ‘We will not find any way to accuse this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 So these chief officials and officers all went to the king, and said to him, ‘King Darius, live forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 All the chief officials of the kingdom, the counsellors and the officers, the judges and the governors, have consulted together to have the king make a law and give a strong command that whoever will ask a petition of any god or person for thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into a den of lions. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Now, O king, give the command and sign the law that, like the law of the Medes and Persians, it may not be changed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 So King Darius signed the law and the command. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 When Daniel learnt that the law was signed, he went into his house. His windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem, and he knelt upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks to his God as he had done before. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 Then these men rushed in and found Daniel praying and calling upon his God. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 So they went before the king and spoke to him about the royal command: ‘Have you not signed a command, that everyone who asks a petition of any person or god within thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?’ The king answered, ‘The rule is fixed according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 Then they went on to say to the king, ‘Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, nor to the command that you have signed, but prays three times a day.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 When the king heard these words, he was greatly displeased, and set his heart on saving Daniel, and he worked until the sun set to save him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 Then these men all went to the king and said to him, ‘Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no command nor law which the king gives may be changed.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 So the king gave his command, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, ‘Your God, whom you always serve, will save you.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 Then a stone was brought and laid at the entrance to the den; and the king sealed it with his own seal-ring and with those of his nobles, that no change might be made so as to rescue Daniel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fastingalone; he could not sleep. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king rose and hurried to the den of lions. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he called anxiously, ‘Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to save you from the lions?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 Daniel said to the king, ‘O king, live forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006022" id="006022" >22</span>
 My God has sent his angel and has closed the lions” mouths, and they have not hurt me, for I was innocent before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006023" id="006023" >23</span>
 Then the king was very glad and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and it was found that he was not injured, for he had trusted in his God. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006024" id="006024" >24</span>
 Then the king commanded that those men who had accused Daniel should be brought and thrown into the den of lions, with their wives and children. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions pounced on them and tore them to pieces. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006025" id="006025" >25</span>
 King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and races in all his kingdom, ‘May your peace be great! 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006026" id="006026" >26</span>
 I make a law that throughout all my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and is the same forever, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed; and his rule will be without end. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027006027" id="006027" >27</span>
 He saves and rescues, and does wonderful things in heaven and earth; it is he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027006028" id="006028" >28</span>
 So Daniel was successful and happy during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian. </p><h6>Vision of the great beasts</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 ‘I saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. I looked until its wings were stripped off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a person; and a human heart was given to it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 And I saw a second beast, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth, between its teeth; and they said to it: “Arise, devour much flesh.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 After this I saw another like a leopard, which had upon its sides four wings of a bird; and the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 After this I saw in the night-visions a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the rest with its feet; and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 While I considered the horns, another little horn came up among them, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; in this horn were eyes, like human eyes, and a mouth speaking arrogrant things. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 ‘I waited until thrones were set up, and an aged one took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and his hair like spotless wool, his throne was fiery flames, its wheels burning fire. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 A fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books were opened. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 ‘I looked at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words which the horn spoke – I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to be fuel for the fire. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 Also the rule of the rest of the beasts was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a fixed time and season. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 ‘I saw in the night-visions that there came with the clouds of heaven one like a human being, and he came even to the Aged One, and was brought near before him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 There was given him dominion and glory, and sovereignty, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away, and his sovereignty one which will not be destroyed.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved by reason of this, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me the interpretation of the things: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 ‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise out of the earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007018" id="007018" >18</span>
 But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, and possess the sovereignty for ever, for ever and ever. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007019" id="007019" >19</span>
 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet: 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three horns fell – it that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, and it appeared to be greater than the rest. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007021" id="007021" >21</span>
 I looked, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007022" id="007022" >22</span>
 until the Aged One came, and judgment was given to the holy one of the Most High, and the fixed time came that the holy ones possessed the sovereignty. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027007023" id="007023" >23</span>
 Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms; and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the holy ones of the Most High; and he will think to change the fixed times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his kingdom, to consume and to destroy finally. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007027" id="007027" >27</span>
 The sovereignty, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will surely be given to the holy people of the Most High; his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and all dominions will serve and obey him.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027007028" id="007028" >28</span>
 Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and I turned pale, but I kept the matter in my mind. </p><h6>Vision of the ram and goat</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision came to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me previously. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 I saw in a vision – and when I saw, I was in the Shushan, the royal palace, which is in the province of Elam – and I saw in a vision, and I was by the River Ulai. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 Then I looked up and saw standing before the river a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could escape, but he did as he pleased and exulted himself. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 As I was observing, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 He came to the ram that had two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was angered against him, and stuck the ram, and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to stand before him, but he threw him down to the ground and trampled upon him, and none could rescue the ram from him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 The he-goat exulted himself exceedingly; and when he had become strong, the great horn was broken. In its place there came up four other horns toward the four winds of heaven. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 Out of one of them came another little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host, and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 It exulted itself even to the prince of the host, and took away from him the daily sacrifice, and threw down the place of his sanctuary, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 and it set up the sacrilegious tithing over the daily sacrifice, and threw down truth to the ground, and did it and prospered. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one who spoke, ‘For how long will the vision be that the daily sacrifice will be taken away and the appalling sacrilege set up and the sanctuary and the host trampled under foot?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 He answered, ‘For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then will the sanctuary be justified.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and suddenly there stood before me one who had the appearance of a man. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 I heard a human voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, ‘Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 So he came near where I stood; and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face, but he said to me, ‘Understand, mortal, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright in my place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 He said, ‘I will make you know what will be in the time of wrath, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 The ram which you saw, with the two horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 The he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between his eyes is the first king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 As for that which was broken so that four stood up in its place, four kingdoms will arise out of his nation, but not with his power. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008023" id="008023" >23</span>
 In the later days of their rule, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king defiant and skilled in dissimulation will stand up. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008024" id="008024" >24</span>
 His power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will utter monstrous things, and will achieve, and will destroy the mighty ones. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 His cleverness will be directed against the holy people; he will succeed through deceit, and devise great things, and he will destroy many unawares; he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be destroyed, but not by human hands. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027008026" id="008026" >26</span>
 The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but hide the vision for it belongs to many days to come.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for days; then I rose up and did the king’s business and I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it. </p><h6>Vision of the seventy weeks</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived by the books the number of years concerning which the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Jeremiah the prophet, that they should be completed while Jerusalem stood in ruins – namely seventy years. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 I turned my face to the Lord God, to apply myself to prayer and supplication, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 I prayed to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God, and made confession, and said, ‘Oh, Lord, the great and the terrible God, who keeps the covenant and shows mercy to those who serve him and keep his commands, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 we have sinned and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances; 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but shame belongs, as at this day, to the people of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel who are near, and those who are afar off, in the lands where you have driven them, because of their crimes which they have committed against you. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 ‘Lord, to us belongs shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our ancestors, because we have sinned against you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 To the Lord our God belongs compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 neither have we obeyed the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God, to walk in his teachings which he set before us by his servants the prophets. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 All Israel have transgressed your law and have turned so as not to obey your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us, and the oath which is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God; for we have sinned against him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great misfortune; for under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done as has been done to Jerusalem. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favour of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and discern your faithfulness. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has watched over the evil and brought it upon us, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 ‘Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gained renown as at this day, we have sinned and we have done wickedly. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 O Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath, I beg you, be turned away from your city, Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of reproach to all who are round about us. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 Listen, our God to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and show favor to your sanctuary, which is desolate, for the sake of your servants, O Lord. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which bears your name; for we do not present our supplications before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great compassion. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and perform; defer not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.’ <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing, my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God for the holy mountain of my God, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen earlier in the vision, being made to fly swiftly, approached me about the time of the evening offering. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 He came, and talked with me, and said, ‘ Daniel, I have now come forth to give you wisdom and insight. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 At the beginning of your supplications the command went forth, and I have come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved; therefore heed the word, and understand the vision. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 ‘Seventy weeks have been decreed upon your people and upon your holy city, to make an end of the sacrilege, and to complete the sin, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the command to repeople and rebuild Jerusalem to the anointed one, the prince, will be seven weeks; sixty-two weeks will it be rebuilt, with broad places and streets. At the end of times 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 (even after the sixty-two weeks) an anointed one will be cut off without judicial trial; and the city and the sanctuary will be destroyed together, and his end will come with a flood and even to the end there will be war, a sentence of desolations. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 The covenant will be annulled for many for one week; and in the midst of the week the sacrifice and the offering will cease, and in its place will be an appalling abomination and that until the ruin determined upon, is poured out upon the appalling thing.’ </p><h6>Vision of the kings of north and south</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a a revelation came to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, and it means great distress. He gave heed to the words, and understood the vision: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 ‘In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 I ate no pleasant bread, neither did any meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were past. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 I looked up, and there was a man clothed in linen, with a belt of pure gold of Ophir; 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 his body also was like the chrysolith, and his face like lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling seized them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, for my fresh appearance was changed to pallor. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 Yet when I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 ‘Suddenly, a hand touched me, which set me trembling upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 He said to me, “Daniel, greatly beloved, give heed to the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for to you have I now been sent.” When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to gain insight, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the prince of the kings of Persia. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 Now I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010015" id="010015" >15</span>
 When he had said these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground, and was dumb. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 Then one who looked human touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him who stood before me, “My Lord, because of the vision my pangs have come upon me, and I retain no strength, 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 for how can this the servant of my Lord talk with my Lord? For as for me, henceforth there remains no strength in me, nor is there breath left in me. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v027010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 ‘Then another in appearance like a person touched me, and strengthened me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v027010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 He said, “Greatly beloved, fear not; peace be to you; be strong, be bold.” When he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my Lord speak; for you have strengthened me.”
