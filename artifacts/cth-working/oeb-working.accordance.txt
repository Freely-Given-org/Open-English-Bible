Gen 1:1 In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, <br>		
Gen 1:2 the earth was still unformed and chaotic, <br>		with darkness on the surface of the abyss, <br>		and the spirit of God hovering over the waters. <br>		
Gen 1:3 God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. <br>		
Gen 1:4 God saw that the light was good. <br>		He separated the light from the darkness, <br>		
Gen 1:5 calling the light ’day’ and the darkness ’night’. <br>	There was an evening and a morning, making the first day. <br><br>	
Gen 1:6 Then God said, ‘Let there be a dome between the waters, <br>		and let it separate the waters from the waters.’ <br>		
Gen 1:7 So God made the dome to separate the waters below <br>		from the waters which were above it. <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:8 God called the dome the ’sky’. <br>	There was an evening and a morning, making the second day. <br><br>	
Gen 1:9 Then God said, ‘Let the waters under the sky be gathered together, <br>		and let the dry ground appear.’ <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:10 God called the dry ground ’land’ <br>		and he called the gathered waters ’seas’. <br>			God saw that it was good. <br><br>	
Gen 1:11 God said, ‘Let the earth put forth vegetation: <br>		Plants on the earth which yield their own kind of seed, <br>		and trees that bear fruits in which are their own seed.’ <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:12 The earth sprouted vegetation: <br>		seed-bearing plants, <br>		and trees with seed-bearing fruit. <br>			God saw that it was good. <br>	
Gen 1:13 There was an evening and a morning, making the third day. <br><br>	
Gen 1:14 Then God said, ‘Let there be lights in the dome of the sky <br>		to separate the night from the day. <br>		Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years. <br>		
Gen 1:15 Let them be lights in the dome of the sky to light the earth.’ <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:16 So God made the two great lights: <br>		The greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night. <br><br>	God made the stars also. 
Gen 1:17 He placed all these lights in the dome of the sky <br>		to shed light upon the earth, <br>		
Gen 1:18 to rule over the day and over the night, <br>		and to separate light from darkness. <br>			God saw that it was good. <br>	
Gen 1:19 There was an evening and a morning, making the fourth day. <br><br>	
Gen 1:20 Then God said, ‘Let the waters teem with living creatures, <br>		and let birds fly over the earth in the open dome of the sky.’ <br>		
Gen 1:21 God created the great sea monsters, <br>		all kinds of living, moving creatures with which the waters teem, <br>		and all kinds of winged birds. <br>			God saw that it was good. <br>		
Gen 1:22 He blessed them, saying, ‘Be fruitful, <br>		increase, fill the oceans, <br>		and let the birds increase on the land.’ <br>	
Gen 1:23 There was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day. <br><br>	
Gen 1:24 Then God said, ‘Let the earth produce all kinds of living creatures: <br>		cattle and reptiles and wild beasts.’ <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:25 So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts, <br>		and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground. <br>			God saw that it was good. <br><br>	
Gen 1:26 Then God said, ‘Let us make humans who are images of us, who are like us. <br>		Let them rule over the fish of the sea, <br>		the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts, <br>		and all the reptiles that crawl upon the ground.’ <br>		
Gen 1:27 So God created humans in his image, <br>			he created them in the image of God. <br>		He created them male and female. <br><br>	
Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them, and said to them: <br>		‘Be fruitful, grow in number, <br>		fill the earth and govern it; <br>		rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, <br>		and over every living thing that crawls on the ground,’ <br><br>	
Gen 1:29 God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant <br>		throughout all the earth, <br>		and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit. <br>		They will be food for you, <br>		
Gen 1:30 and to every wild beast and to every bird of the sky, <br>		and to everything that crawls on the earth - <br>		everything with the breath of life in it, <br>		I give every green plant for food.’ <br>			It was so. <br>		
Gen 1:31 When God saw all that he had made, <br>		he perceived that it was very good. <br>	There was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day. <br><br>	
Gen 2:1 So the heavens and the earth were finished, and everything in them. <br>		
Gen 2:2 When on the seventh day God finished the work which he had done, <br>		he rested that day from all his work. <br>		
Gen 2:3 God blessed the seventh day and set it apart, <br>		for in it he rested from all the creative work which he had done.  ¶ 
Gen 2:4 This is the story of the heavens and earth when they were created. <br> ¶ At the time when the  <c>Lord</c> God made earth and heaven, 
Gen 2:5 there were not yet any plants on the earth, and no vegetation had sprung up; for the  <c>Lord</c> God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the soil. 
Gen 2:6 A mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground.  ¶ 
Gen 2:7 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God moulded a human being out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living being. 
Gen 2:8 The  <c>Lord</c> God planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and placed the human he had formed there. 
Gen 2:9 From the soil the  <c>Lord</c> God made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food, with the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil.  ¶ 
Gen 2:10 A river flowed out of Eden and watered the garden, and from there branched into four. 
Gen 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon, which flows round the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
Gen 2:12 The gold of that land is pure and there is aromatic gum and the onyx stone. 
Gen 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows round the whole land of Cush, 
Gen 2:14 and the name of the third river is the Tigris, which heads toward the east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.  ¶ 
Gen 2:15 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God took the human and placed him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it. 
Gen 2:16 The  <c>Lord</c> God also gave the human this command: ‘You may freely eat from every tree of the garden, 
Gen 2:17 except from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you must not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.’  ¶ 
Gen 2:18 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God said, ‘It is not good for the human to be alone; I will make a helper suited to him.’ 
Gen 2:19 So out of the ground the  <c>Lord</c> God formed all the wild beasts and birds, and made them come to the human to see what he would call them. Whatever he called each living creature, that was its name. 
Gen 2:20 So the human, Adam gave names to all cattle and all the wild birds and beasts. But there was no companion suitable for him.  ¶ 
Gen 2:21 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God caused the human to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. 
Gen 2:22 With the rib which he had taken from the human, the  <c>Lord</c> built up a woman and brought her to the human. 
Gen 2:23 Then the human said, ‘This now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, for from man she was taken.’ 
Gen 2:24 For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two become one flesh.  ¶ 
Gen 2:25 The man and his wife were both naked, yet felt no shame.  ¶ 
Gen 3:1 Now the snake was craftier than any other wild beast that the  <c>Lord</c> God had made. It said to the woman, ‘Has God really said, “You must not eat from any tree of the garden”?’ 
Gen 3:2 The woman answered, ‘We are allowed to eat the fruit of all the trees of the garden; 
Gen 3:3 it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God has said, “You must not eat from it, nor should you touch it, for if you do, you will die.”’ 
Gen 3:4 Then the snake said to the woman, ‘You will not die! 
Gen 3:5 God knows that on the day you eat some of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing what is good and what is evil.’  ¶ 
Gen 3:6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, attractive to look at and desirable for acquiring wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.  ¶ 
Gen 3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they  that they were naked, so they sewed fig-leaves together to cover themselves. 
Gen 3:8 But when they heard the sound of the  <c>Lord</c> God walking in the garden in the evening breeze, the man and his wife hid from him among the garden trees.  ¶ 
Gen 3:9 When the  <c>Lord</c> God called to the man, ‘Where are you?’ 
Gen 3:10 he replied, ‘I heard you in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.’ 
Gen 3:11 The  <c>Lord</c> God said, ‘Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree from which I ordered you not to eat?’ 
Gen 3:12 The man answered, ‘The woman you placed beside me, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.’ 
Gen 3:13 The  <c>Lord</c> God said to the woman, ‘What is this that you have done?’ The woman replied, ‘The snake deceived me, and I ate.’  ¶ 
Gen 3:14 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God said to the snake: <br>	‘Because you have done this, <br>	you will be more accursed than all cattle <br>	and all the wild beasts. <br>	You will crawl on your belly <br>	and eat dust <br>	all your life. <br>	
Gen 3:15 I will establish hostility between you and the woman, <br>	between your offspring and hers, <br>	who will wound your head, <br>	and you will wound their heel.’  ¶ 
Gen 3:16 To the woman he said, <br>	‘I will greatly increase your anguished toil in pregnancy; <br>	with pain will you bear children. <br>	<br>	You will yearn for your husband, <br>	but he will rule over you.’  ¶ 
Gen 3:17 To Adam he said, <br>	‘Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, <br>	and ate from the tree <br>	about which I ordered you: <br>	’You must never eat from it’ <br>	the ground will be cursed because of you; <br>	as long as you live, you will earn a living only by anguished toil. <br><br>	
Gen 3:18 The ground will always bring forth thorns and thistles, <br>	and you will eat the plants of the field. <br>	
Gen 3:19 By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread, <br>	until you return to the ground, <br>	for from it you were taken; <br>	for dust you are, <br>	and to dust you will return!’  ¶ 
Gen 3:20 The man, Adam, named his wife Eve <sup>[ Heb Havvah, that is, Life. ]</sup>; because she was the mother of all living people. 
Gen 3:21 The  <c>Lord</c> God made clothes from animal skins for Adam and his wife and dressed them.  ¶ 
Gen 3:22 Then the  <c>Lord</c> God said: ‘The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not reach out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.’ 
Gen 3:23 So the  <c>Lord</c> God sent him out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken. 
Gen 3:24 He drove out Adam and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the blazing whirling sword, to bar the way to the tree of life.           ¶ 
Gen 4:1 Adam lay with his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain, and she said, ‘I have created a man with the help of the  <c>Lord</c>!’ 
Gen 4:2 She also gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, while Cain was a farmer.  ¶ 
Gen 4:3 In the course of time Cain brought some of the ground’s produce as an offering to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
Gen 4:4 Abel too brought some of the choicest animals of his flock and sacrificed their fat pieces. The  <c>Lord</c> looked with approval on Abel and his offering 
Gen 4:5 but he could not receive Cain and his offering with approval.  ¶ Cain burned with anger and his face fell. 
Gen 4:6 So the  <c>Lord</c> said to Cain, ‘Why are you angry and why do you scowl? 
Gen 4:7 If you do what is right and good, can’t you hold your head up high? But if you do wrong, sin crouches at the door and longs to have you, but you must master it.’  ¶ 
Gen 4:8 Cain said to his brother Abel, ‘Let us go into the field.’ While they were there, Cain attacked his brother and killed him.  ¶ 
Gen 4:9 Then the  <c>Lord</c> asked Cain, ‘Where is your brother Abel?’ He answered, ‘I do not know! Am I my brother’s keeper?’  ¶ 
Gen 4:10 ‘What have you done?’ the  <c>Lord</c> replied, ‘Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. 
Gen 4:11 Even now you are cursed by the very ground that has opened to receive your brother’s blood shed by your hand. 
Gen 4:12 From now on when you till the ground, it will no longer yield its best to you. You will be a vagabond and a wandering refugee upon the earth.’  ¶ 
Gen 4:13 Then Cain said to the  <c>Lord</c>, ‘My punishment is too much for me to bear. 
Gen 4:14 Look! Today you banish me from the ground. I must hide in your presence. I will be a wandering refugee upon the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me!’  ¶ 
Gen 4:15 But the  <c>Lord</c> said to him, ‘If any one kills you, the crime shall be avenged sevenfold.’ So the  <c>Lord</c> placed a distinctive mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him. 
Gen 4:16 Cain departed from the  <c>Lord</c>’s presence and lived east of Eden in the land of Wandering.  ¶ 
Gen 4:17 Cain lay with his wife. She became pregnant, giving birth to Enoch. Cain built a city, and named it after his son Enoch. 
Gen 4:18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.  ¶ 
Gen 4:19 Lamech took two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
Gen 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the ancestor of the people who live in tents and have cattle. 
Gen 4:21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of the people who play the harp and flute. 
Gen 4:22 As for Zillah, she gave birth to Tubal-cain, who forged all sort of tools from copper and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.  ¶ 
Gen 4:23 Lamech said to his wives: <br>	‘Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; <br>		wives of Lamech, listen to my speech; <br>	because I have slain a man for wounding me, <br>		and a young man for bruising me. <br>	
Gen 4:24 If Cain is to be avenged sevenfold, <br>		then Lamech will be seventy and sevenfold.’  ¶ 
Gen 4:25 Adam lay with his wife again and she bore a son. She named him Seth: ‘because God gave me another son for Abel, who was killed by Cain.’ 
Gen 4:26 Seth too had a son. He named him Enosh. That was when people began worshipping in the name of  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
Gen 5:1 This is the list of the descendants of Adam. On the day that God created human beings, he made them in his own image. 
Gen 5:2 He created them male and female created, and blessed them, and called their name Adam.  ¶ 
Gen 5:3 Adam lived for a hundred and thirty years, and had a son in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth. 
Gen 5:4 Adam lived for eight hundred years after he had Seth; and he had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:5 In total, Adam lived for nine hundred and thirty years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:6 Seth lived for a hundred and five years, and fathered Enosh. 
Gen 5:7 Seth lived a further eight hundred and seven years after he had Enosh, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:8 In total, Seth lived for nine hundred and twelve years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:9 Enosh lived for ninety years, and fathered Kenan. 
Gen 5:10 Enosh lived a further eight hundred and fifteen years after he had Kenan, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:11 In total, Enosh lived for nine hundred and five years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:12 Kenan lived for seventy years, and fathered Mahalalel. 
Gen 5:13 Kenan lived for eight hundred and forty years after he had Mahalalel, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:14 In total, Kenan lived for nine hundred and ten years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:15 Mahalalel lived for sixty and five years, and fathered Jared. 
Gen 5:16 Mahalalel lived for eight hundred and thirty years after he had Jared, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:17 In total, Mahalalel lived for eight hundred ninety and five years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:18 Jared lived for a hundred sixty and two years, and fathered Enoch. 
Gen 5:19 Jared lived for eight hundred years after he had Enoch, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:20 In total, Jared lived for nine hundred sixty and two years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:21 Enoch lived for sixty and five years, and fathered Methuselah. 
Gen 5:22 Enoch walked with God for three hundred years after he had Methuselah, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:23 In total, Enoch lived for three hundred sixty and five years. 
Gen 5:24 Enoch walked with God, and then he was gone; because God took him.  ¶ 
Gen 5:25 Methuselah lived for a hundred eighty and seven years, and fathered Lamech. 
Gen 5:26 Methuselah lived for seven hundred eighty and two years after he had Lamech, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:27 In total, Methuselah lived for nine hundred sixty and nine years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:28 Lamech lived for a hundred eighty and two years, and had a son. 
Gen 5:29 He named him Noah, saying: ‘He will bring us relief from our work and the toil of our hands which comes from the ground the  <c>Lord</c> cursed.’ 
Gen 5:30 Lamech lived for five hundred ninety and five years after he had Noah, and had sons and daughters. 
Gen 5:31 In total, Lamech lived for seven hundred seventy and seven years; and then he died.  ¶ 
Gen 5:32 When Noah was five hundred years old, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  ¶ 
Gen 6:1 When people began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, 
Gen 6:2 some of the heavenly beings saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful; and they took them as wives, whoever they chose. 
Gen 6:3 But the  <c>Lord</c> said: ‘My spirit shall not abide in people forever, because they are flesh; therefore they will live for only a hundred and twenty years.’ 
Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days (and later too) when the heavenly beings lay with the human daughters who had their children. These were the mighty heroes of old, men of renown.  ¶ 
Gen 6:5 When the  <c>Lord</c> saw that people’s wickedness was increasing in the world, and that the trend of their thoughts was at all times toward evil, 
Gen 6:6 he was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made people on the earth. 
Gen 6:7 Therefore the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘I will destroy all living beings from off the ground — people, animals, creeping things, and birds — because I regret that I have made them.’ 
Gen 6:8 But Noah had won the  <c>Lord</c>’s favour.  ¶ 
Gen 6:9 This is the story of Noah. Among the people of his time, Noah was righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God. 
Gen 6:10 Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
Gen 6:11 God saw that the earth was corrupt and full of violence. 
Gen 6:12 God looked at the earth and saw that it was corrupt; all living things on the earth had become corrupt in their ways.  ¶ 
Gen 6:13 So God said to Noah, ‘I have determined to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with their acts of injustice; I am going to destroy them from the earth. 
Gen 6:14 Make yourself an ark of cypress wood. Construct rooms in the ark, and coat it within and without with pitch. 
Gen 6:15 This is how you shall build it: the length of the ark shall be five hundred feet, its breadth eighty feet, and its height fifty feet. 
Gen 6:16 Make a roof for it and place the door on the side. Construct it with lower, second, and third storeys. 
Gen 6:17 For I am about to bring floods of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven every living thing in which is the breath of life; every thing that is on the earth shall die.  ¶ 
Gen 6:18 ‘But I will make a solemn agreement with you. Go into the ark with your sons, your wife and their wives, 
Gen 6:19 and take with you into the ark two of every kind living thing, a male and a female, 
Gen 6:20 birds, animals and creeping things, so that they might be kept alive. 
Gen 6:21 Take and store food for them and you.’  ¶ 
Gen 6:22 Noah did all this. He did everything that God told him to.  ¶ 
Gen 7:1 Then the  <c>Lord</c> said to Noah, ‘Enter with all your household into the ark; for I see that in this age you are living before me an upright life. 
Gen 7:2 Take seven of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are not fit for food and sacrifice take only two, the male and the female; 
Gen 7:3 and of the wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice take seven, to keep the species alive on the earth. 
Gen 7:4 After seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made.’  ¶ 
Gen 7:5 Then Noah did all that the  <c>Lord</c> commanded him. 
Gen 7:6 He was six hundred years old, and when the waters of the flood came upon the earth 
Gen 7:7 he, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood 
Gen 7:8 together with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground. 
Gen 7:9 Two by two, male and female, they entered the ark as God had commanded Noah.  ¶ 
Gen 7:10 After seven days, the flood waters came. 
Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day, all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened — and 
Gen 7:12 it rained for forty days and forty nights. 
Gen 7:13 That was the day that Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, and 
Gen 7:14 every type of animal, and cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and bird 
Gen 7:15 went with Noah into the ark, two by two of every kind of living thing. 
Gen 7:16 They went in, male and female, as God had commanded Noah; and the  <c>Lord</c> shut Noah in the ark.  ¶ 
Gen 7:17 The flood continued for forty days, and the waters increased and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth. 
Gen 7:18 It floated on the surface as the waters rose higher over the land. 
Gen 7:19 Higher the waters rose over the land — until the highest mountains were covered 
Gen 7:20 by more than twenty feet.  ¶ 
Gen 7:21 All creatures on the land, bird and cattle and animals, every creature that swarms on the ground, every person, 
Gen 7:22 everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life, died. 
Gen 7:23 The  <c>Lord</c> destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and creeping things, and the birds of the heavens, and Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark.  ¶ 
Gen 7:24 The waters did not start to go down for a hundred and fifty days.  ¶ 
Gen 8:1 Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood subsided, 
Gen 8:2 the fountains of the deed were stopped and the windows of heaven closed, and the rain from heaven ceased, 
Gen 8:3 and the waters withdrew more and more from the land for a hundred and fifty days. 
Gen 8:4 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 
Gen 8:5 The waters continued to go down until, on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains could be seen.  ¶ 
Gen 8:6 After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark, 
Gen 8:7 and sent out a raven; and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
Gen 8:8 He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the ground; 
Gen 8:9 but the dove found no rest for her foot, and so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the surface of the whole earth. So he reached out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark.  ¶ 
Gen 8:10 Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark. 
Gen 8:11 The dove came in to him at dusk and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. 
Gen 8:12 He waited seven days more and sent out the dove; but it did not return to him again.  ¶ 
Gen 8:13 So it was that in the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the waters had dried up. Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 
Gen 8:14 It was the twenty-seventh day of the second month.  ¶ 
Gen 8:15 God said to Noah, 
Gen 8:16 ‘Leave the ark with your wife and sons and their wives. 
Gen 8:17 Bring out every living creature, every bird, cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they can spread over the earth, and be fruitful and multiply.’ 
Gen 8:18 So Noah left the ark with his sons and his wife and his son’s wives, 
Gen 8:19 and every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird came out one kind after another. 
Gen 8:20 Noah built an altar to the  <c>Lord</c> and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. 
Gen 8:21 When the  <c>Lord</c> smelled the pleasing odour, he said to himself, ‘I will never again curse the ground because of people because the inclination of their heart is evil from their youth, nor will I again destroy every living thing, as I have done. 
Gen 8:22 While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.’  ¶ 
Gen 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‘Bear children and multiply and repopulate the earth. 
Gen 9:2 Every wild beast and bird and everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea shall fear and dread you; into your hand they are given. 
Gen 9:3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as I gave the green herbs, I give them all to you. 
Gen 9:4 Only you shall not eat flesh while the life is in it, that is, the blood.  ¶ 
Gen 9:5 ‘Moreover, your own life-blood will I require for a person’s life; from every beast will I require it, and from everyone who takes another’s life. 
Gen 9:6 Whoever sheds a person’s blood, by people shall their blood be shed; for God made people in his own image. 
Gen 9:7 But you are to bear children and repopulate the whole earth and subdue it.’  ¶ 
Gen 9:8 God also said to Noah and to his sons with him, 
Gen 9:9 ‘Now I make this solemn agreement with you and with your descendants 
Gen 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you, with the birds, the cattle, and every wild animal that is with you of all that have gone out of the ark, even with every beast of the earth. 
Gen 9:11 This is my solemn agreement: No living thing will ever again be cut off by the waters of the flood, and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.’  ¶ 
Gen 9:12 God said, ‘This is the symbol of the solemn agreement that I make for all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you: 
Gen 9:13 I have placed my bow in the cloud and it shall be the symbol of the solemn agreement between me and the inhabitants of the earth. 
Gen 9:14 Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud, 
Gen 9:15 I will remember the agreement which is between me and you and every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all living things. 
Gen 9:16 Whenever the bow is seen in the cloud, I will see it and remember the everlasting agreement between God and every living creature on earth,’ 
Gen 9:17 God said to Noah, ‘it is the sign of the solemn agreement which I have made with everything that lives on earth.’  ¶ 
Gen 9:18 The sons of Noah, who left the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan. 
Gen 9:19 The descendants of these three sons of Noah spread over the whole earth.  ¶ 
Gen 9:20 Now Noah, the farmer, was the first to plant a vineyard. 
Gen 9:21 When he drank the wine he became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent. 
Gen 9:22 Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers about it. 
Gen 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward to cover the nakedness of their father, their faces being turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. 
Gen 9:24 When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
Gen 9:25 he said, <br>	Cursed be Canaan; <br>	may he be a slave of slaves to his brothers.  ¶ 
Gen 9:26 Also he said: <br>	Blessed of the  <c>Lord</c> be Shem; <br>		and let Canaan be a slave to him. <br>	
Gen 9:27 God enlarge Japheth <br>		and let him live in the tents of Shem. <br>	Let Canaan be a slave to him as well.  ¶ 
Gen 9:28 Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
Gen 9:29 All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died. 
Gen 10:1 Now these are the descendants of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and to them were sons born after the flood. 
Gen 10:2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
Gen 10:3 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
Gen 10:4 The sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
Gen 10:5 From the descendants of these were the peoples of the coasts and islands divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
Gen 10:6 The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 
Gen 10:7 The sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. 
Gen 10:8 Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be known as a mighty one in the earth. 
Gen 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the  <c>Lord</c>; which is why people say: ‘Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the  <c>Lord</c>.’ 
Gen 10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
Gen 10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, 
Gen 10:12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah — which is the great city. 
Gen 10:13 Mizraim fathered Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
Gen 10:14 and Pathrusim, and Casluhim — from whom went forth the Philistines — and Caphtorim. 
Gen 10:15 Canaan fathered Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 
Gen 10:16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 
Gen 10:17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; 
Gen 10:18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 
Gen 10:19 The border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha. 
Gen 10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. 
Gen 10:21 To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 
Gen 10:22 The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 
Gen 10:23 The sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
Gen 10:24 Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber. 
Gen 10:25 To Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 
Gen 10:26 Joktan fathered Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; 
Gen 10:27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; 
Gen 10:28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; 
Gen 10:29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
Gen 10:30 Their settlements were from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, to the mountain of the east. 
Gen 10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
Gen 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.  ¶ 
Gen 11:1 All the inhabitants of the earth had one language and vocabulary; 
Gen 11:2 and as they travelled westward, they found a broad valley in the land of Shinar, and made their home there.  ¶ 
Gen 11:3 Then they said one to another, ‘Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them.’ So they had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar. 
Gen 11:4 They said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will touch the heavens. We will make a landmark, so that we are not scattered over all the earth.’  ¶ 
Gen 11:5 But when the  <c>Lord</c> came down to see the city and tower that people had built, 
Gen 11:6 he said, ‘See, they are one people and all have one language. This is only the beginning of their activity, and now nothing that they propose to do will seem too difficult for them. 
Gen 11:7 Come, let us go down there and confuse their language, so that they do not understand each other’s speech.’  ¶ 
Gen 11:8 So the  <c>Lord</c> scattered them from there over all the earth; and they ceased building the city. 
Gen 11:9 That is why they named it Babel <sup>[ Confusion ]</sup>, for there the  <c>Lord</c> confused the language of all the inhabitants of earth and scattered them over the whole world.  ¶ 
Gen 11:10 These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood. 
Gen 11:11 Shem lived for five hundred years after he fathered Arpachshad, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:12 Arpachshad lived for five and thirty years, and fathered Shelah. 
Gen 11:13 Arpachshad lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Shelah, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:14 Shelah lived for thirty years, and fathered Eber. 
Gen 11:15 Shelah lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Eber, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:16 Eber lived for four and thirty years, and fathered Peleg. 
Gen 11:17 Eber lived for four hundred and thirty years after he fathered Peleg, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:18 Peleg lived for thirty years, and fathered Reu. 
Gen 11:19 Peleg lived for two hundred and nine years after he fathered Reu, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:20 Reu lived for two and thirty years, and fathered Serug. 
Gen 11:21 Reu lived for two hundred and seven years after he fathered Serug, and fathered sons and daughters. 
Gen 11:22 Serug lived for thirty years, and fathered Nahor.  ¶ 
Gen 11:23 Serug lived for two hundred years after he fathered Nahor, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:24 Nahor lived for nine and twenty years, and fathered Terah. 
Gen 11:25 Nahor lived for a hundred and nineteen years after he fathered Terah, and fathered sons and daughters.  ¶ 
Gen 11:26 Terah lived for seventy years, and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.  ¶ 
Gen 11:27 Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. 
Gen 11:28 Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees. 
Gen 11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
Gen 11:30 Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
Gen 11:31 Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they nt to Haran, and dwelt there. 
Gen 11:32 In total, Terah lived for two hundred and five years; and died in Haran.  ¶ 
Gen 12:1 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Abram, ‘Go from your country, your relatives and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 
Gen 12:2 I will make of you a great nation; and I will surely bless you and make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing. 
Gen 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you, and all the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like your own.’  ¶ 
Gen 12:4 So Abram set out, as the  <c>Lord</c> had commanded him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. 
Gen 12:5 He took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son and all the slaves that they had acquired in Haran, and started for the land of Canaan.  ¶ 
Gen 12:6 Abram passed through the land to a place called Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites lived there. 
Gen 12:7 The  <c>Lord</c> appeared to Abram and said, ‘To your descendants I will give this land.’ There Abram built an altar to the  <c>Lord</c> who had appeared to him. 
Gen 12:8 From there he moved on to the hill at the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east, and there too he built an altar to the  <c>Lord</c> and prayed to him.  ¶ 
Gen 12:9 Abram moved on, going from place to place toward the Nagreb. 
Gen 12:10 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there; because the famine was severe in the land. 
Gen 12:11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, ‘You are a beautiful woman; 
Gen 12:12 so that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, “She is his wife”; and they will kill me, but let you live. 
Gen 12:13 Say you are my sister, so that everything may go well for me because of you and my life will be spared.’ 
Gen 12:14 W hen Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Serai was very beautiful. 
Gen 12:15 The officials of Pharaoh, when they saw her, praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh’s household. 
Gen 12:16 He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, and oxen and donkeys, and male and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels. 
Gen 12:17 But the  <c>Lord</c> sent great plagues to Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 
Gen 12:18 Pharaoh called Abram and said, ‘What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 
Gen 12:19 Why did you say, “She is my sister,” so that I took her to be my wife? Here she is, take her and go.’ 
Gen 12:20 Pharaoh gave his men orders to send him on his way with his wife and all his possessions.  ¶ 
Gen 13:1 So Abram and his wife and all his possessions left Egypt and went to the Negreb and Lot went with him. 
Gen 13:2 Abram was now very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
Gen 13:3 He journeyed on from the Negreb in stages towards Bethel, to the place where he had earlier pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai 
Gen 13:4 and had set up the alter to worship the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
Gen 13:5 Lot, who went with Abram, also had so many flocks and herds and tents 
Gen 13:6 that the land was not fertile enough to support them both. They had too many animals to live in the same place. 
Gen 13:7 At that time, the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land. So when there was a quarrel between Lot’s herdsmen and Abram’s herdsmen, 
Gen 13:8 Abram said to Lot, ‘There should be no quarrels between me and you, or between my herdsmen and yours, because we are relatives. 
Gen 13:9 Is not the whole land before you? Let’s separate. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.’  ¶ 
Gen 13:10 Then Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of the  <c>Lord</c>. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
Gen 13:11 So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan and went on to the east; and they separated from one another. 
Gen 13:12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan and Lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
Gen 13:13 (But the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinned against the  <c>Lord</c>.)  ¶ 
Gen 13:14 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Abram, after Lot had gone away from him, ‘Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward and westward, 
Gen 13:15 for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever. 
Gen 13:16 I will make your descendants as many as the dust of the earth, so that if someone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted. 
Gen 13:17 Rise, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.’  ¶ 
Gen 13:18 Then Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
Gen 14:1 I n the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
Gen 14:2 they went to war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
Gen 14:3 All these joined forces together in the valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).  ¶ 
Gen 14:4 For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaonier, but in the thirteenth year they had rebelled. 
Gen 14:5 So in the fourteenth year Chedorlaonier, and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim, 
Gen 14:6 and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, to El-Paran, which is on the edge of the wilderness. 
Gen 14:7 Then they returned and came to En-Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and laid waste all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-Tamar.  ¶ 
Gen 14:8 So the king of Sodom went out together with the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar); and they set themselves in battle array against them in the valley of Siddim; 
Gen 14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 
Gen 14:10 Now the valley of Siddim is full of bitumen pits; so when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but those who remained fled to the mountain. 
Gen 14:11 Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions and went their way. 
Gen 14:12 They also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who was living in Sodom, and his goods and departed.  ¶ 
Gen 14:13 But one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were supporters of Abram. 
Gen 14:14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. 
Gen 14:15 Then, dividing his band in order to attack the kings by night, he with his servants attacked them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 
Gen 14:16 So he brought back all the goods, and also his kinsman Lot, with his goods, as well as the women and the people.  ¶ 
Gen 14:17 Then the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Vale). 
Gen 14:18 Melchizedek king of Salem also brought out bread and wine; and he was priest of God Most High. 
Gen 14:19 He blessed him saying: <br>	Blessed be Abram before God Most High, <br>		possessor of heaven and earth. <br>	
Gen 14:20 Blessed be God Most High, <br>		who has delivered your foes into your power. <br> ¶ Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.  ¶ 
Gen 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, ‘Give me my people, and take the goods for yourself.’ 
Gen 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, ‘I have lifted up my hand to the  <c>Lord</c>, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, 
Gen 14:23 that I would not take a thread nor a sandal-thong nor anything that is yours, so that you could not say, “I have made Abram rich.” 
Gen 14:24 By no means! Only that which the servants have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre — let them take their portion.’  ¶ 
Gen 15:1 After these things God spoke to Abram in a vision saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield. Your reward will be exceedingly great.’ 
Gen 15:2 But Abram said, ‘Lord  <c>God</c>, what can you give me? I am childless, and the person who will be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus, 
Gen 15:3 to me you have given no offspring, and, so a slave born in my house is my heir.’ 
Gen 15:4 The word of the  <c>Lord</c> came to him, ‘This man will not be your heir, but a child of your own will be your heir.’  ¶ 
Gen 15:5 Then God brought him outside and said, ‘Look now toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them! So will your descendants be.’ 
Gen 15:6 Abram believed in the  <c>Lord</c>; and the  <c>Lord</c> reckoned it to him as righteousness, 
Gen 15:7 and said to him, ‘I am the  <c>Lord</c> who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give to you this land to inherit it.’  ¶ 
Gen 15:8 Abram said, ‘Lord  <c>God</c>, how will I know that I will inherit it?’  ¶ 
Gen 15:9 The  <c>Lord</c> said to him, ‘Bring me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.’ 
Gen 15:10 Abram brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds he did not divide. 
Gen 15:11 The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.  ¶ 
Gen 15:12 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a horror of great darkness fell on him. 
Gen 15:13 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Abram, ‘Know certainly that your descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there; and they will be held there for four hundred years. 
Gen 15:14 But I will judge that nation, whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many goods. 
Gen 15:15 But you will go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried in a good old age. 
Gen 15:16 In the fourth generation they return here again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.’  ¶ 
Gen 15:17 When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between the pieces of the animals.  ¶ 
Gen 15:18 At that time the  <c>Lord</c> made a solemn agreement with Abram, saying, ‘To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.’ 
Gen 15:19 (This includes the lands of the Kenite, the Kenizzite, the Kadmonite, 
Gen 15:20 the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Rephaim, 
Gen 15:21 the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Girgashite, and Jebusite).  ¶ 
Gen 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar. 
Gen 16:2 Sarai said to Abram, ‘the  <c>Lord</c> has denied me children; Take my slave-girl; maybe I will obtain children by her.’ Then Abram listened to her 
Gen 16:3 so she took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, after Abram had lived for ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife 
Gen 16:4 and Abram lay with Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.  ¶ 
Gen 16:5 Sarai complained to Abram, ‘May the wrong I suffer be on you! I myself gave my slave-girl to you; and now that she sees that she has conceived, I am despised by her; may the  <c>Lord</c> judge between me and you.’ 
Gen 16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, ‘Your maid-servant is in your power, do to her whatever seems right to you.’ Then Sarai ill-treated her so that she fled from her presence.  ¶ 
Gen 16:7 The messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring in the way to Shur. 
Gen 16:8 He said, ‘Hagar, Sarai’s slave-girl, where have you come from? And where are you going?’ She said, ‘I am fleeing from the presence of mistress Sarai.’ 
Gen 16:9 Then the messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> said to her, ‘Return to your mistress and submit yourself to her authority.’ 
Gen 16:10 Moreover the messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> said to her, ‘I will make your descendants so many that they can not be numbered because they are so numerous.’ 
Gen 16:11 The messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> also said to her, ‘You are pregnant, and will have a son; you must call him Ishmael God hears, because the  <c>Lord</c> has heard of your ill-treatment.’ <br>	
Gen 16:12 He shall be like a wild donkey, <br>		his hand against every man, <br>		and every man’s hand against him; <br>	and he will live at odds with all his relatives.  ¶ 
Gen 16:13 Then she called the name of the  <c>Lord</c>, who had spoken to her, El-roi (You are a God who sees me); for she said, ‘Have I seen God and am I still alive after I have looked upon him?’ 
Gen 16:14 Therefore the well is called Beer-lahai-roi <sup>[ Well of the living One who sees me ]</sup>, ( it is between Kadesh and Bered) 
Gen 16:15 Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
Gen 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael.  ¶ 
Gen 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the  <c>Lord</c> revealed himself to Abram and said to him, ‘I am God Almighty, walk before me and be blameless 
Gen 17:2 and I will make my solemn agreement between me and you and will make your descendants exceedingly numerous.’ 
Gen 17:3 Then Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying 
Gen 17:4 ‘I make this solemn promise to you: you will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
Gen 17:5 Neither will your name any longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I will make you the father of a multitude of nations. 
Gen 17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and will make nations of you, and kings shall spring from you. 
Gen 17:7 I will establish my solemn agreement between me and you and your descendants after your throughout their generations, an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your descendants after you. 
Gen 17:8 I will give to you, and to your descendants after your, the land where you are now foreigners, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.’  ¶ 
Gen 17:9 God also said to Abraham, ‘As for you, you must keep the requirements of my solemn agreement, you, and your descendants after you throughout their generations. 
Gen 17:10 This is my solemn agreement, which you must keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you must be circumcised. 
Gen 17:11 Whenever you are circumcised, the flesh of your foreskin shall be a sign of a solemn agreement between me and you. 
Gen 17:12 Every male when he is eight days old, must be circumcised throughout your generations, whether he is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring. 
Gen 17:13 The slave who is born in your house and the one who is bought with your money must be circumcised. The sign of my solemn agreement will be in your flesh — an everlasting agreement. 
Gen 17:14 As for the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that one will be cut off from his people; he has broken my solemn agreement.’  ¶ 
Gen 17:15 Then God said to Abraham, ‘As for Sarai your wife, do not call her name Sarai, but Sarah. 
Gen 17:16 I will bless her, and will give you a son from her: I will bless her, and she will become the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.’  ¶ 
Gen 17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself. ‘Will a child be born to one who is an hundred years old? Will Sarah who is ninety years old bear children?’ 
Gen 17:18 Abraham said to God, ‘If only Ishmael might live with your blessing!’  ¶ 
Gen 17:19 But God said, ‘No. But Sarah your wife is about to bear your a son; call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 
Gen 17:20 However I have heard you regarding Ishmael: I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and his descendants exceedingly many. Twelve princes he will father, and I will make him a great nation. 
Gen 17:21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time next year.’ 
Gen 17:22 When he had finished talking with him, God left Abraham.  ¶ 
Gen 17:23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very same day, as God had said to him. 
Gen 17:24 Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
Gen 17:25 Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
Gen 17:26 On this very same day was Abraham circumcised, with Ishmael his son. 
Gen 17:27 All the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from foreigners, were circumcised with him.  ¶ 
Gen 18:1 The  <c>Lord</c> also appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day; 
Gen 18:2 and, as he looked up, three men stood there before him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed to the ground 
Gen 18:3 and said, ‘Sirs, if you are willing to do me a favour, do not, I beg of you, pass by your servant. 
Gen 18:4 Since you have come to your servant, let a little water be brought, so that you may wash your feet, and lie down under the tree. 
Gen 18:5 And let me bring some food, so that you may refresh yourselves; afterward you may go on your way.’ They replied, ‘Do as you have said.’  ¶ 
Gen 18:6 So Abraham hastened to Sarah’s tent and said, ‘Make ready quickly four measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.’ 
Gen 18:7 Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a calf that was tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he prepared it quickly. 
Gen 18:8 Then Abraham took curd and milk, with the calf that he had prepared, and served them; and he waited on them under the tree, while they ate.  ¶ 
Gen 18:9 Then they said to him, ‘Where is your wife?’ He said, ‘There, within the tent.’ 
Gen 18:10 One of them said, ‘I will surely return to you about nine months from now, and then, Sarah your wife shall have a son.’ But Sarah was listening behind the door of the tent. 
Gen 18:11 Now Sarah and Abraham were advanced in years; 
Gen 18:12 so she laughed to herself, saying, ‘After I and my husband are so old will I have pleasure?’ 
Gen 18:13 But the  <c>Lord</c> said to Abraham, ‘Why did Sarah laugh, saying, “Will I, indeed, even when I am old give birth to a child?” 
Gen 18:14 Is anything too wonderful for the  <c>Lord</c>? At the appointed time about nine months from now, I will return to you and Sarah shall have a son.’ 
Gen 18:15 Sarah was frightened and denied that she had laughed, but he said ‘Yes, you laughed.’  ¶ 
Gen 18:16 Then the men started from there and looked off in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went along with them to start them on their way. 
Gen 18:17 the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘Should I conceal from Abraham that which I am about to do, 
Gen 18:18 since Abraham will become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will want a blessing like his for themselves? 
Gen 18:19 For I have chosen him in order that he may teach his sons and his household after him, and that they may keep the way of the  <c>Lord</c>, by doing righteousness and justice, so that the  <c>Lord</c> may bring on Abraham that which he has promised concerning him.’  ¶ 
Gen 18:20 The  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘The complaint has come that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have committed great and terrible sins. 
Gen 18:21 I will go down and see whether they have done exactly as the complaint comes to me; and if they have not, I will know.’  ¶ 
Gen 18:22 As the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, Abraham remained standing before the  <c>Lord</c>. 
Gen 18:23 Abraham drew near to the  <c>Lord</c> and said, ‘Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
Gen 18:24 Suppose there are within the city fifty people who are righteous. Will you sweep it away and not forgive the place for sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? 
Gen 18:25 Far be it from you to do this: to slay the righteous with the wicked! And that the righteous should be treated as the wicked, far be it from you! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?’ 
Gen 18:26 The  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘If I find in the city of Sodom fifty who are righteous, I will spare the whole place for their sake.’ 
Gen 18:27 Abraham answered, ‘I have dared to speak to the  <c>Lord</c>, even though I am but dust and ashes. 
Gen 18:28 Suppose there be five lacking of the fifty righteous. Will you sweep away all the city for lack of five?’ The  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘I will not sweep it away, if I find forty-five there.’  ¶ 
Gen 18:29 Then Abraham spoke to him again, and said, ‘Suppose forty are found there?’ He replied, ‘For the sake of forty I will not do it.’ 
Gen 18:30 Then Abraham said, ‘Oh, let not the  <c>Lord</c> be angry, but let me speak. Suppose thirty are found there?’ He answered, ‘I will not do it, if I find thirty there.’ 
Gen 18:31 Then Abraham said, ‘You see that I have dared to speak to the  <c>Lord</c>. Suppose twenty are found there?’ He replied, ‘For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.’ 
Gen 18:32 Then Abraham said, ‘Oh, let not the  <c>Lord</c> be angry, but let me speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there?’ And he said, ‘For the sake of the ten I will not destroy it.’ 
Gen 18:33 Then the  <c>Lord</c> went his way, and Abraham returned home.  ¶ 
Gen 19:1 Two messengers came to Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed with his face to the earth 
Gen 19:2 and said, ‘Sirs, turn aside, I beg of you, into your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way.’ They said, ‘No, we will spend the night in the street.’ 
Gen 19:3 But he urged them so strongly that they went with him and entered his house. He made a feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate.  ¶ 
Gen 19:4 But before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. 
Gen 19:5 They called out to Lot, ‘Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can rape them.’  ¶ 
Gen 19:6 Then Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the door after him. 
Gen 19:7 He said, ‘I beg of you, my friends, do not do what is wrong. 
Gen 19:8 See, I have two unmarried daughters; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you desire; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.’ 
Gen 19:9 But they replied, ‘Stand back!’ And they added, ‘This one came in as a foreigner to live here, but now he would set himself up as a judge! We will treat you worse than them.’ They pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the door. 
Gen 19:10 But the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and shut the door. 
Gen 19:11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of searching for the door.  ¶ 
Gen 19:12 Then the men said to Lot, ‘Have you any one else here? Bring your sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city out of this place, 
Gen 19:13 for we are about to destroy it, because great complaint concerning the people has come to the  <c>Lord</c> and he has sent us to destroy it.’ 
Gen 19:14 So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, ‘Up, go out of this place, for the  <c>Lord</c> will destroy the city.’ But his sons-in-law thought he was only jesting.  ¶ 
Gen 19:15 When the dawn appeared, the messengers urged Lot, saying, ‘Get up, take your wife and your two daughters so that you may not be swept away in the punishment of the city.’ 
Gen 19:16 When he hesitated, the men grabbed him by the hand and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for the  <c>Lord</c> was merciful to him.  ¶ 
Gen 19:17 When they had brought them outside, they said, ‘Run for your life; do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the heights, that you may not be swept away!’ 
Gen 19:18 But Lot said to them, ‘Oh, sirs, not so! 
Gen 19:19 See, your servant has found favour with you, and you have shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die. 
Gen 19:20 See now, this village is near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my life will be saved.’ 
Gen 19:21 He answered, ‘I have also granted you this favour, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken. 
Gen 19:22 Make haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.’ Therefore the village was called Zoar <sup>[ Little ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 19:23 The sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar. 
Gen 19:24 Then the  <c>Lord</c> caused brimstone and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah, 
Gen 19:25 and he destroyed those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and all that grew on the ground. 
Gen 19:26 But Lot’s wife, who was following him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.  ¶ 
Gen 19:27 Early in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had stood before the  <c>Lord</c>; 
Gen 19:28 and as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a smelting-furnace. 
Gen 19:29 God had remembered Abraham when he destroyed the cities of the plain and rescued Lot from the destruction.  ¶ 
Gen 19:30 Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. 
Gen 19:31 The older daughter said to the younger, ‘Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world. 
Gen 19:32 Come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.’ 
Gen 19:33 So they made their father drink wine that night; and the older daughter went in and lay with her father. He, however, did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
Gen 19:34 Then in the morning the older daughter said to the younger, ‘Last night I lay with my father. Let us make him drink wine again tonight; and you go in and lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.’ 
Gen 19:35 So they made their father drink wine that night as well. The younger arose and lay with him. He, however, did not know when she lay down nor when she arose. 
Gen 19:36 In this way both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 
Gen 19:37 Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. His oldest daughter bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the present Moabites. 
Gen 19:38 The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi. That one is the father of the present Ammonites.  ¶ 
Gen 20:1 Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negreb, settling between Kadesh and Shur, and staying for a while in Gerar, 
Gen 20:2 where he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
Gen 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him, ‘You will die, because of the woman you have taken, for she is married. 
Gen 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her; so he said, Lord, will you slay an innocent people? 
Gen 20:5 Did Abraham not himself say to me, “She is my sister?” And even she herself said, “He is my brother.” I acted innocently and in good faith.’ 
Gen 20:6 Then God said to him in the dream, ‘I know that you acted innocently and in good faith, and I also prevented you from sinning against me, since I did not allow you to touch her. 
Gen 20:7 Now you must restore the man’s wife — for he is a prophet and he can intercede for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her at once, you will die, together with all your people.’ 
Gen 20:8 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and summoned all his court, and when he had told all these things in their hearing, they were greatly afraid.  ¶ 
Gen 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked him, ‘What have you done to us? What harm have I done to you to make you bring this great sin on me and my kingdom? You have done to me something that ought not to be done.’ 
Gen 20:10 Abimelech said to Abraham, ‘What was your purpose in doing this thing?’ 
Gen 20:11 Abraham answered, ‘Because I thought, “Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.” 
Gen 20:12 Moreover, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
Gen 20:13 So when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, “This is how you can show your loyalty to me: at every place to which we come, say that you are my brother.”’  ¶ 
Gen 20:14 Abimelech then took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him. 
Gen 20:15 Also Abimelech said, ‘My land lies before you; live wherever you please.’ 
Gen 20:16 To Sarah he said, ‘I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silveras compensation for all that has befallen you; and in every respect you are vindicated.’ 
Gen 20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his slave-girls, so that they could have children ( 
Gen 20:18 for the  <c>Lord</c> had made every woman in Abimelech’s household barren, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife).  ¶ 
Gen 21:1 The  <c>Lord</c> remembered what he had told Sarah, and he did as he had promised. 
Gen 21:2 So Sarah had Abraham’s son in his old age at the fixed time of which God had told him. 
Gen 21:3 Abraham named him Isaac <sup>[ Laughter ]</sup>
Gen 21:4 and when he was eight days old he circumcised him as God had told him to. 
Gen 21:5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born. 
Gen 21:6 Sarah said, ‘God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.’ 
Gen 21:7 She added, ‘Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have born him a son in his old age.’  ¶ 
Gen 21:8 When the child grew up, Abraham made a great feast on the day that he was weaned. 
Gen 21:9 But Sarah saw the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. 
Gen 21:10 S he said to Abraham, ‘Drive out this slave-girl and her son, for the son of this slave-girl shall not be heir with my son Isaac’ 
Gen 21:11 This request was very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son. 
Gen 21:12 But the  <c>Lord</c> said to Abraham, ‘Do not be displeased because of the boy and because of your slave-girl. Listen to all that Sarah says to you, for only through the line of Isaac will your name be perpetuated. 
Gen 21:13 But I will also make of the son of the slave-girl a great nation, because he is your son.’  ¶ 
Gen 21:14 Then Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, and he put the boy upon her shoulder and sent her away. So she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
Gen 21:15 When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under one of the desert shrubs 
Gen 21:16 and went a short distance away and sat down and said, ‘Let me not see the death of the child.’ So she sat there and wept.  ¶ 
Gen 21:17 Then the  <c>Lord</c> heard the cry of the boy, and the messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> called to Hagar from heaven and said, ‘What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for the  <c>Lord</c> has heard the boy’s cry. 
Gen 21:18 Rise, lift him up, and hold him fast by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.’ 
Gen 21:19 The  <c>Lord</c> opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. Then she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.  ¶ 
Gen 21:20 The  <c>Lord</c> was with the boy, and he grew up, 
Gen 21:21 and lived in the wilderness of Paran, and became a bowman. His mother secured a wife for him from Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 21:22 It happened at that time that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, ‘God is with you in all you do. 
Gen 21:23 Now therefore take an oath to me here by God that you will not be false to me, nor to my son nor to my descendants; but that you will treat me and the land you have stayed in according to the kindness which I have shown you.’ 
Gen 21:24 Abraham said, ‘I swear it.’  ¶ 
Gen 21:25 Now as often as Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized, 
Gen 21:26 Abimelech said, ‘I do not know who has done this thing, neither have you told me nor have I heard of it until today.’ 
Gen 21:27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and made an agreement with each other. 
Gen 21:28 But when Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves, 
Gen 21:29 Abimelech said to Abraham, ‘What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?’ 
Gen 21:30 Abraham answered, ‘Accept these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that you may be my witness that I dug this well.’ 
Gen 21:31 The place was called Beer-sheba, because it was there they swore their oath. 
Gen 21:32 So they made a solemn agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech arose with Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. 
Gen 21:33 Abraham, however, planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the  <c>Lord</c>, the Everlasting God. 
Gen 21:34 Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.  ¶ 
Gen 22:1 Later the  <c>Lord</c> tested Abraham, saying to him, ‘Abraham’; and he answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
Gen 22:2 The  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will show you.’  ¶ 
Gen 22:3 So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. When he had split the wood for the burnt-offering, he set out for the place of which God had told him. 
Gen 22:4 On the third day, when Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance, 
Gen 22:5 he said to his servants, ‘Stay here with the donkey, while I and the boy go over there. When we have worshipped, we will come back to you.’  ¶ 
Gen 22:6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac, his son. He took the fire and the knife, and they both went on together. 
Gen 22:7 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, ‘My father!’ and Abraham answered, ‘Yes, my son.’ Isaac said, ‘Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?’ 
Gen 22:8 Abraham answered, ‘My son, God will himself provide a lamb for a burnt-offering.’ So the two went on together.  ¶ 
Gen 22:9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood on it and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
Gen 22:10 Then Abraham reached out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. 
Gen 22:11 But the messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> called to him from heaven, saying, ‘Abraham, Abraham!’ and he answered, ‘Here am I.’ 
Gen 22:12 He said, ‘Do not put your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him, for now I know that you love God, for you have not refused to give your son, your only son, to me.’  ¶ 
Gen 22:13 Then Abraham looked up, and he saw a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. 
Gen 22:14 So Abraham took the ram and offered him up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. 
Gen 22:15 He named the place ‘The  <c>Lord</c> will provide’ — and even today people say, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> will provide on his mountain.’  ¶ 
Gen 22:16 The messenger of the  <c>Lord</c> again called to Abraham and said, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> declares, “Because you have done this thing and have not kept back your son, your only son, 
Gen 22:17 I will surely bless you. I will make your children as many as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore, so that they will conquer their enemies. 
Gen 22:18 All the nations of the earth will ask for themselves a blessing like theirs, because you have obeyed my command.”’  ¶ 
Gen 22:19 So Abraham returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba.  ¶ Abraham was living in Beer-sheba. 
Gen 22:20 After these things, Abraham was told, ‘Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor, 
Gen 22:21 Uz his first born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
Gen 22:22 Chesed, Hazo and Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.’ 
Gen 22:23 (And Bethuel fathered Rebekah). These eight Mileah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
Gen 22:24 And his concubine whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maaeah.  ¶ 
Gen 23:1 Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. 
Gen 23:2 When she died in Kiriath-arba (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan, Abraham went to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  ¶ 
Gen 23:3 When Abraham rose up from the presence of his dead, he said to the Hittites, 
Gen 23:4 ‘I am a stranger and a foreigner living among you; give me possession of a burying-place with you, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.’ 
Gen 23:5 The Hittites answered Abraham, 
Gen 23:6 ‘Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the best of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, so that you may bury your dead.’  ¶ 
Gen 23:7 Abraham rose up and bowed before the people of the land, the Hittites, 
Gen 23:8 and said to them, ‘If it is your intention that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and speak for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
Gen 23:9 to give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give to me for the full price in your presence, so that I can own it as a burying-place.’ 
Gen 23:10 Now Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites, and, in the presence of all the Hittites, all who went in and out at the gate of his city he answered Abraham, 
Gen 23:11 ‘No, my lord, hear me. I give the field to you and the cave that is in it I give to you; in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.’  ¶ 
Gen 23:12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land, 
Gen 23:13 and spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, ‘Please, hear me — I will give the price of the field; accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there.’  ¶ 
Gen 23:14 Ephron answered Abraham by saying to him, 
Gen 23:15 ‘My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.’ 
Gen 23:16 Then Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, on the standard weights used by merchants.  ¶ 
Gen 23:17 So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah which was to the east of Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, with all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about, 
Gen 23:18 were transferred to Abraham’s possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all that went in at the gate of his city.  ¶ 
Gen 23:19 After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
Gen 23:20 In this way the field and the cave that is in it were transferred by the Hittites to Abraham that he might possess a burying-place.  ¶ 
Gen 24:1 When Abraham was very old and the  <c>Lord</c> had blessed him in every way, 
Gen 24:2 Abraham said to the eldest of his household servants, who had charge of all his affairs, ‘Put your hand under my thigh, 
Gen 24:3 while I make you promise by the  <c>Lord</c>, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, 
Gen 24:4 but that you will go to my own country and to my relatives and there get a wife for my son Isaac.’ 
Gen 24:5 The servant said to him, ‘Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?’ 
Gen 24:6 Abraham said to him, ‘See to it that you do not take my son back there. 
Gen 24:7 The  <c>Lord</c>, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land and who solemnly promised me, “To your children I will give this land,” will send his messenger before you and there you will get a wife for my son. 
Gen 24:8 But if the woman is not willing to come with you, then you will be free from this promise to me; only never take my son back there.’ 
Gen 24:9 So the servant put his hand under Abraham’s thigh and made the promise.  ¶ 
Gen 24:10 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and set out with precious gifts from his master. So he went to the town of Aram-naharaim, where Nahor lived. 
Gen 24:11 He made the camels kneel down outside the town by the well in the evening, at the time when women go out to draw water. 
Gen 24:12 Then he said, ‘ <c>Lord</c>, God of my master Abraham, give me, I pray, success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
Gen 24:13 Here I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw water. 
Gen 24:14 May that young woman to whom I shall say, “Please let down your water-jar that I may drink”; and who answers, “Drink and I will also water your camels,” may she be the one you have chosen for thy servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown kindness to my master.’  ¶ 
Gen 24:15 Then even before he was through speaking, Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water-jar upon her shoulder. 
Gen 24:16 She was very beautiful and unmarried, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up. 
Gen 24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar.’ 
Gen 24:18 She answered, ‘Drink, sir,’ and quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder upon her hand and gave him a drink.  ¶ 
Gen 24:19 When she had finished giving him a drink she said, ‘I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.’ 
Gen 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 
Gen 24:21 Meanwhile the man was silently gazing at her in order to find out whether the  <c>Lord</c> had made his journey successful or not.  ¶ 
Gen 24:22 As soon as the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring, half a shekel in weight, and put it in her nose, and put on her arms two golden bracelets weighing ten shekels, 
Gen 24:23 and said, ‘Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I beg of you. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?’ 
Gen 24:24 She answered, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel son of of Milcah and Nahor. 
Gen 24:25 We have plenty of straw and feed, and there is a place for you to spend the night.’  ¶ 
Gen 24:26 Then the man bowed his head and worshipped the  <c>Lord</c>, 
Gen 24:27 saying, ‘Blessed be the  <c>Lord</c>, the God of my master Abraham, who has continued to show his mercy and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the  <c>Lord</c> has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.’  ¶ 
Gen 24:28 Then the young woman ran and told these things to her mother’s family. 
Gen 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the spring. 
Gen 24:30 When he saw the bracelets on his sister’s hands and the ring, and when he heard Rebekah say, ‘This is what the man said to me,’ he went to the man, who was still standing by the camels at the spring, 
Gen 24:31 and said, ‘Come in, you who are blessed by the  <c>Lord</c>! Why do you stand outside? For I have cleared the house and have room for the camels.’ 
Gen 24:32 So he brought the man into the house and took the packs off the camels and furnished straw and feed for them, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.  ¶ 
Gen 24:33 But when food was set before him to eat, he said, ‘I will not eat until I have made known my errand.’ They answered, ‘Speak.’ 
Gen 24:34 He said, ‘I am Abraham’s servant; 
Gen 24:35 and the  <c>Lord</c> has blessed my master greatly, so that he has become very rich. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants, and camels and donkeys. 
Gen 24:36 Now Sarah, my master’s wife, had a son when she was old, and my master has given him all that he has. 
Gen 24:37 My master also made me promise, saying, “Do not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
Gen 24:38 but go to my father’s home and to my relatives and there find a wife for my son.”  ¶ 
Gen 24:39 ‘When I said to my master, “What if the woman will not follow me?” 
Gen 24:40 he said to me, “The  <c>Lord</c>, whom I love and serve, will send his messenger with you and make you successful, and you will find for my son a wife from among my relatives and my father’s family. 
Gen 24:41 Then you will be free from your promise to me. But if you go to my family and they do not give her to you, you shall also be free from your promise to me.” 
Gen 24:42 So I came today to the spring and said, “ <c>Lord</c>, God of my master Abraham, see, I am standing by the spring of water. If you will make the errand on which I am going successful, then let the young woman who comes to draw, to whom I say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink”, 
Gen 24:44 and who shall say to me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels”, let that one be the woman whom the  <c>Lord</c> has chosen for my master’s son.”  ¶ 
Gen 24:45 ‘Even before I was through speaking, Rebekah came out with her water-jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. When I said to her, “Please let me drink,” 
Gen 24:46 she quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder and answered, “Drink, and I will also water your camels.” So I drank, and she also watered the camels. 
Gen 24:47 Then I asked her, “Whose daughter are you?” She said, “The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.” So I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 
Gen 24:48 I bowed my head and worshipped and blessed the  <c>Lord</c> God of my master Abraham who had led me on the right way to find the daughter of my master’s brother for his son. 
Gen 24:49 Tell me whether or not you will deal kindly and truly with my master, so that I shall know what to do!’  ¶ 
Gen 24:50 Then Laban and his family answered, ‘The matter is in the hands of the  <c>Lord</c>. We cannot say either “yes” or “no.” 
Gen 24:51 See, Rebekah is before you; take her and go and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the  <c>Lord</c> has said.’  ¶ 
Gen 24:52 When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the  <c>Lord</c>. 
Gen 24:53 Then he brought out gold and silver ornaments and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
Gen 24:54 He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.  ¶ When they rose in the morning, the servant said, ‘Send me away to my master.’ 
Gen 24:55 But Rebekah’s brother and mother answered, ‘Let the young woman stay with us a month or at least ten days; after that she may go.’ 
Gen 24:56 But he said to them, ‘Do not delay me, for the  <c>Lord</c> has given me success. Send me away that I may go to my master.’  ¶ 
Gen 24:57 Then they said, ‘We will call the young woman and ask her.’ 
Gen 24:58 So they called Rebekah and said to her, ‘Will you go with this man?’ She answered, ‘I will go.’ 
Gen 24:59 So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men.  ¶ 
Gen 24:60 They also blessed Rebekah, saying to her, ‘Our sister! May your children and their children become thousands and thousands, may your sons conquer the cities of their enemies!’ 
Gen 24:61 Then Rebekah set out with her maids and, riding upon the camels, they followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went away.  ¶ 
Gen 24:62 Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb. 
Gen 24:63 In the evening, when Isaac had gone out for a walk in the field, he looked up and saw camels coming. 
Gen 24:64 Rebekah too looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she quickly alighted from the camel 
Gen 24:65 and said to the servant, ‘Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?’ When the servant said, ‘It is my master,’ she took her veil and covered her face. 
Gen 24:66 Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done. 
Gen 24:67 Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of Sarah his mother, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.  ¶ 
Gen 25:1 Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
Gen 25:2 She gave him sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
Gen 25:3 Jokshan fathered Sheba, and Dedan. T he sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim; 
Gen 25:4 and the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.  ¶ 
Gen 25:5 Abraham had left all that he had to Isaac. 
Gen 25:6 But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham had given gifts while he was still alive, and had sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.  ¶ 
Gen 25:7 Abraham had lived for one hundred and seventy-five years, 
Gen 25:8 when he breathed his last, dying in a good old age, old and satisfied with living, and was gathered to his forefathers.  ¶ 
Gen 25:9 Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre, 
Gen 25:10 the field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.  ¶ 
Gen 25:11 After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, who settled at Beer-lahai-roi.  ¶ 
Gen 25:12 This is a list of descedents of Ishmael, Abraham’s son whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid-servant gave to Abraham. 
Gen 25:13 These then are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named according to their order of birth: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
Gen 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
Gen 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
Gen 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their peoples.  ¶ 
Gen 25:17 Ishmael lived for one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. 
Gen 25:18 They settled from Havilah to Shur that is east of Egypt, as far as Assyria; he settled down alongside all his people.  ¶ 
Gen 25:19 These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham fathered Isaac. 
Gen 25:20 Isaac was forty years old, when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.  ¶ 
Gen 25:21 Isaac prayed to the  <c>Lord</c> for his wife, because she had no children; and the  <c>Lord</c> heard his prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant with twins. 
Gen 25:22 The children struggled against each other in her womb, and she said, ‘Why is this happening to me? What does it mean?’ She went to ask the  <c>Lord</c>, 
Gen 25:23 who said to her, <br>	‘Two nations are in your womb, <br>		two peoples divided from birth, <br>	One will be stronger than the other, <br>		the elder will serve the younger.’  ¶ 
Gen 25:24 When the time came for her to give birth, she became the mother of twin boys. 
Gen 25:25 The first was from birth red, all over like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau <sup>[ Hairy ]</sup>. 
Gen 25:26 Afterwards his brother came holding Esau’s heel with his hand; so he was named Jacob <sup>[ Supplanter ]</sup>. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.  ¶ 
Gen 25:27 As they grew up, Esau became a skilful hunter, a man who lived out in the fields; but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed about the tents. 
Gen 25:28 Isaac loved Esau, for he had a taste for venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.  ¶ 
Gen 25:29 Once when Jacob was preparing a stew, Esau came in from the fields, and he was very hungry; 
Gen 25:30 so he said to Jacob, ‘Let me swallow some of that red stew, for I am very hungry.’ (This is why he was called Edom.) 
Gen 25:31 But Jacob said, ‘Sell me first of all your right as the eldest.’ 
Gen 25:32 Esau replied, ‘See, I am nearly dead now! So of what use is this birthright to me?’ 
Gen 25:33 Jacob said, ‘First solemnly promise to give it to me.’ So Esau solemnly promised and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
Gen 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils, and when he had finished eating and drinking, he got up and went away. In this way Esau gave away his birthright.  ¶ 
Gen 26:1 Now when a famine came in the land, (not the first famine that was in the days of Abraham), Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.  ¶ 
Gen 26:2 The  <c>Lord</c> appeared to him and said, ‘Go not down into Egypt; settle in the land of which I will tell you, 
Gen 26:3 stay in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you, and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, and will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father: 
Gen 26:4 I will make your descendants as many as the stars of heaven, and give to your descendants all these lands; and all the nations of the earth will invoke for themselves a blessing like that of your descendants, 
Gen 26:5 because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.’ 
Gen 26:6 So Isaac settled in Gerar.  ¶ 
Gen 26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, ‘She is my sister’; for he was afraid to say ‘my wife’; lest the men of the place kill him for Rebekah; because she was beautiful to look at. 
Gen 26:8 But after he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of the window, and saw Isaac just as he was caressing Rebekah his wife.  ¶ 
Gen 26:9 Then Abimelech called to Isaac, and said, ‘Surely she is your wife; why did you say “She is my sister?”’ Isaac answered him, ‘I said it, so that I might not die because of her.’ 
Gen 26:10 Abimelech said, ‘What is this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife and so you would have brought guilt upon us.’ 
Gen 26:11 Abimelech warned all the people, saying, ‘The person who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.’  ¶ 
Gen 26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year an increase of a hundredfold, for the  <c>Lord</c> blessed him. 
Gen 26:13 The man became rich, and grew richer and richer until he became very wealthy; for he had many flocks, and many herds, and a great household; so that the Philistines envied him.  ¶ 
Gen 26:14 Now all the wells which Isaac’s father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. 
Gen 26:15 But Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father — for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he gave them the same names as his father had given them.  ¶ 
Gen 26:16 Abimelech said to Isaac, ‘Go from us; for you are much mightier than we are.’ 
Gen 26:17 So Isaac departed, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there. 
Gen 26:18 Isaac reopened the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and stopped by the Philistines after his death. He called them by the names his father had given them. 
Gen 26:19 When Isaac’s slaves dug in the valley, they found there a well of spring water. 
Gen 26:20 The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, ‘The water is ours.’ So he called the name of the well Esek <sup>[ Contention ]</sup>, because they contended with him. 
Gen 26:21 And when they dug another well, they quarreled over that also. So he called the name of it Sitnah <sup>[ Enmity ]</sup>. 
Gen 26:22 He moved on from these and dug another well; and over that one there was no dispute. So he called it Rehoboth <sup>[ Room ]</sup>, and said, ‘For now the  <c>Lord</c> has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land.’  ¶ 
Gen 26:23 Isaac went up from there to Beer-sheba. 
Gen 26:24 The  <c>Lord</c> appeared to him the same night and said, ‘I am the God of Abraham your father, do not be afraid, because I am with you, and will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham.’ 
Gen 26:25 Isaac built an altar there, and called upon the name of the  <c>Lord</c>, and pitched his tent there. There also Isaac’s slaves dug a well.  ¶ 
Gen 26:26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. 
Gen 26:27 Isaac said to them, ‘Why have you come to me, since you hated me and have driven me away from you?’ 
Gen 26:28 They said, ‘We saw plainly that the  <c>Lord</c> was with you, so we said, “Let there now be a sworn treaty between us — let us make a solemn agreement with you — 
Gen 26:29 so that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.” You are now blessed of the  <c>Lord</c>.’ 
Gen 26:30 And he made them a feast and they ate and drank. 
Gen 26:31 Then in the morning they arose early and took oaths with each other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
Gen 26:32 That same day, Isaac’s slaves came and told him about a well which they had dug, and said to him, ‘We have found water.’ 
Gen 26:33 He called it Shebna <sup>[ Oath ]</sup>, therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.  ¶ 
Gen 26:34 When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, 
Gen 26:35 and they were a source of grief to Isaac and to Rebekah.  ¶ 
Gen 27:1 When Isaac was so old and so nearly blind that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son and said to him, ‘My son.’ Esau answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
Gen 27:2 Isaac said, ‘See, I am old and do not know how soon I may die. 
Gen 27:3 T ake your quiver and your bow and go out into the fields and hunt venison for me 
Gen 27:4 and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat and that I may bless you before I die.’  ¶ 
Gen 27:5 Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went into the fields to hunt venison, 
Gen 27:6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, ‘I just now heard your father say to your brother Esau, 
Gen 27:7 “Bring me venison and prepare for me savory food that I may eat it and bless you before I die.” 
Gen 27:8 Now, my son, do as I tell you: 
Gen 27:9 Go to the flock and bring me from there two good young goats, and I will make of them savory food for your father, such as he loves. 
Gen 27:10 Then take it to him, so that he may eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.’ 
Gen 27:11 But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, ‘You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am smooth. 
Gen 27:12 Perhaps my father will touch me; then I will appear to him to be a deceiver, and I will bring blame upon me and not a blessing.’ 
Gen 27:13 But his mother said to him, ‘Let the curse be on me, my son; only obey me and go, bring the goats to me.’ 
Gen 27:14 So he went and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food such as his father loved.  ¶ 
Gen 27:15 Rebekah also took the fine clothes of her older son Esau, which she had with her in the tent, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
Gen 27:16 Then she put the skins of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck, 
Gen 27:17 and she placed the savory food and the bread which she had prepared in his hand, 
Gen 27:18 and he went to his father and said, ‘My father.’ Isaac answered, ‘Here I am; who are you, my son?’ 
Gen 27:19 Jacob said, ‘I am Esau your oldest son. I have done as you commanded me. Sit up and eat some of my venison, so that you may bless me.’ 
Gen 27:20 Isaac said to his son, ‘How very quickly you have found it, my son.’ He answered, ‘Yes, because the  <c>Lord</c> your God gave me success.’  ¶ 
Gen 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, ‘Come here, my son, that I may touch you to find out whether you are really my son Esau or not.’ 
Gen 27:22 So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
Gen 27:23 Are you really my son Esau?’ Jacob answered, ‘I am.’ Isaac did not recognise him, for his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s. So he blessed him. 
Gen 27:25 Then Isaac said, ‘Bring the food to me, that I may eat some of my son’s venison and bless you.’ So he brought it to him, and he ate. Jacob also brought him wine, and he drank.  ¶ 
Gen 27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, ‘Come near now and kiss me, my son.’ 
Gen 27:27 As he came near and kissed him, he smelled the smell of his garment, and blessed him: <br>	See, the smell of my son <br>		is as that of fields blessed by the  <c>Lord</c>. <br>	
Gen 27:28 May God give you dew from heaven, <br>		a share in the earth’s fertile places, <br>		and plenty of corn and wine. <br>	
Gen 27:29 May peoples be subject to you, <br>		and nations bow down to you. <br>	Be master over your brothers. <br>		Let your mother’s sons bow down before you, <br>	Cursed be all who curse you. <br>		and blessed be all who bless you.  ¶ 
Gen 27:30 As soon as Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and Jacob was about to leave his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
Gen 27:31 He also had made savory food and was bringing it to his father. So he said to him, ‘Father, rise and eat of your son’s venison, that you may bless me.’ 
Gen 27:32 But Isaac his father said to him, ‘Who are you?’ He answered, ‘I am your son, your oldest, Esau.’ 
Gen 27:33 Then Isaac trembled and said, ‘Who then is he that has hunted venison and brought it to me, so that I ate plentifully before you came, and blessed him? His blessing cannot be undone!’  ¶ 
Gen 27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, ‘Father, bless me also!’  ¶ 
Gen 27:35 But Isaac said, ‘Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.’ 
Gen 27:36 Esau said, ‘He was correctly named Jacob <sup>[ means Supplanter ]</sup>. He has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!’ Then he said, ‘Have you kept a blessing for me?’ 
Gen 27:37 Isaac answered Esau, ‘I have made him your master and I have given to him all his relatives as slaves and grain and wine as his food. What then can I do for you, my son?’ 
Gen 27:38 Esau said to his father, ‘Is that the only blessing you have, my father? Father, bless me too!’ and Esau began to weep aloud. 
Gen 27:39 Then Isaac his father answered him: <br>	‘You shall live far from earth’s fertile places, <br>		and away from the dew of heaven. <br>	
Gen 27:40 By your sword you will live, <br>		and your brother you will serve. <br>	But whenever you will break loose, <br>		you will break off his yoke from your neck.’  ¶ 
Gen 27:41 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him. Esau said to himself, ‘My father will soon die; then I will kill Jacob, my brother.’  ¶ 
Gen 27:42 When the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, ‘Your brother, Esau, is going to kill you. 
Gen 27:43 Now, my son, listen to me: run away to my brother Laban at Haran 
Gen 27:44 and stay with him for a time until your brother is no longer angry 
Gen 27:45 — until he is no longer angry and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?’  ¶ 
Gen 27:46 Rebekah said to Isaac, ‘I am disgusted with life because of the Hittite women; if Jacob marries a Hittite woman, such as these, the women of the land, I might as well die.’  ¶ 
Gen 28:1 Then Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and instructed him, ‘You must not marry any of the daughters of Canaan. 
Gen 28:2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
Gen 28:3 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful and numerous, so that you may become a great people, 
Gen 28:4 and may he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you so that you may inherit the land you have settled in, which God gave to Abraham.’  ¶ 
Gen 28:5 So Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau’s mother. 
Gen 28:6 Now when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and send him away to Paddan-aram, to find a wife there, and that, as he blessed him, he instructed him: ‘You must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan’, 
Gen 28:7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-aram, 
Gen 28:8 and when Esau also saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father, 
Gen 28:9 then Esau went to Ishmael, and in addition to the wives that he had, married Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth.  ¶ 
Gen 28:10 Then Jacob set out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. 
Gen 28:11 When he arrived at a certain holy place, he passed the night there, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from its place and put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 
Gen 28:12 Then he dreamed and saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and the messengers of God were going up and down on it.  ¶ 
Gen 28:13 The  <c>Lord</c> also stood beside him and said, ‘I am the  <c>Lord</c>, God of Abraham and God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your children. 
Gen 28:14 Your descendants will be as countless as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and all the families of the earth will wish for a blessing like yours and that of your descendants. 
Gen 28:15 See, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.’  ¶ 
Gen 28:16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, ‘Surely the  <c>Lord</c> is in this place, and I did not know it.’ 
Gen 28:17 And he was filled with awe and said, ‘This place is the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.’  ¶ 
Gen 28:18 So Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. 
Gen 28:19 He named that place Bethel <sup>[ which means House of God ]</sup>. (The earlier name of the town was Luz.) 
Gen 28:20 Jacob also made this promise, ‘If God will be with me and protect me on this journey which I am making and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, 
Gen 28:21 and if I return safe and sound to my father’s house, then the  <c>Lord</c> shall be my God, 
Gen 28:22 and this stone which I have set up as a pillar will be a house of God. And of all that you give me I will surely give a tenth to you.’  ¶ 
Gen 29:1 Jacob continued on his journey and arrived at the land of the people of the East. 
Gen 29:2 He looked and saw a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep lying down by it; for from that well they watered the flocks; but there was a large stone over the well. 
Gen 29:3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds used to roll away the stone and water the sheep and then put the stone back in its place over the well.  ¶ 
Gen 29:4 Jacob said to the men, ‘My friends, from where do you come?’ They said, ‘We are from Haran.’ 
Gen 29:5 Then he said to them, ‘Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?’ They said, ‘We know him.’ 
Gen 29:6 He said to them, ‘Is all well with him?’ They said, ‘All is well; indeed, this is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.’ 
Gen 29:7 H e said, ‘See, the sun is still high! It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep and feed them.’ 
Gen 29:8 But they said, ‘We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll away the stone from the well; then we will water the sheep.’  ¶ 
Gen 29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she was a shepherdess. 
Gen 29:10 When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 
Gen 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. 
Gen 29:12 When Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, she ran and told her father.  ¶ 
Gen 29:13 As soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, put his arms round him, kissed him many times, and brought him to his home. When Jacob told Laban all that had happened, 
Gen 29:14 Laban said to him, ‘Surely you are my bone and my flesh.’ So he remained with him a whole month.  ¶ 
Gen 29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, ‘Should you serve me for nothing simply because you are related to me? Tell me what shall be your wages?’ 
Gen 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
Gen 29:17 Leah’s eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful. 
Gen 29:18 Jacob loved Rachel, and so he said, ‘I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.’ 
Gen 29:19 Laban said, ‘It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to any other man. Stay with me.’ 
Gen 29:20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days, because he loved her so.  ¶ 
Gen 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, ‘Give me my wife, for my time is up, and let me marry her.’ 
Gen 29:22 So Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast. 
Gen 29:23 In the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob received her as his wife. 
Gen 29:24 At the same time Laban gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah.  ¶ 
Gen 29:25 When in the morning Jacob found it was Leah, he said to Laban, ‘What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?’ 
Gen 29:26 Laban said, ‘It is not the custom among us to give the younger in marriage before the older. 
Gen 29:27 Remain with this one during the marriage week, then we will give you the other also for the service which you will give me during seven more years.’ 
Gen 29:28 Jacob did so: he remained with Leah during the marriage week. Then Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife, 
Gen 29:29 and his slave-girl Bilhah to serve Rachel. 
Gen 29:30 Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and loved Rachel more than Leah. So he had to serve Laban seven years more.  ¶ 
Gen 29:31 When the  <c>Lord</c> saw that Leah was spurned, he gave her the gift of motherhood; Rachel, however, was barren. 
Gen 29:32 So Leah gave birth to a son whom she named Reuben <sup>[ Behold a son ]</sup>; for she said, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> has seen my affliction; now my husband will love me.’ 
Gen 29:33 She gave birth to another son; and said, ‘Because the  <c>Lord</c> has heard that I am spurned, he has given me this one also’; and she called his name Simeon <sup>[ Hearing ]</sup>. 
Gen 29:34 She gave birth to another son and said, ‘Now this time my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons’; therefore his name was called Levi <sup>[ Attached ]</sup>. 
Gen 29:35 She gave birth to another son and said, ‘This time I will praise the  <c>Lord</c>’; therefore she called his name Judah <sup>[ Praise ]</sup> then she stopped having children.  ¶ 
Gen 30:1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she was jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, ‘Give me children or else I will die.’ 
Gen 30:2 But Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, ‘Am I in God’s place? Who has withheld offspring from you?’ 
Gen 30:3 She said, ‘Here is my slave-girl Bilhah, go to her, so that she may bear sons who can be laid on my knees and I also may obtain children though her.’ 
Gen 30:4 So she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl for a wife, and Jacob slept with her. 
Gen 30:5 When Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son, 
Gen 30:6 Rachel said, ‘God has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son.’ So she called his name Dan <sup>[ He judged ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 30:7 Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. 
Gen 30:8 Rachel said, ‘With superhuman wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed’; so she called his name Naphtali <sup>[ Obtained by wrestling ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took Zilpah her slave-girl, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
Gen 30:10 Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl bore Jacob a son. 
Gen 30:11 Leah said, ‘Fortunate!’ and she called his name Gad. 
Gen 30:12 Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, 
Gen 30:13 and Leah said, ‘Happy am I! Now women will call me happy’, and she called his name Asher.  ¶ 
Gen 30:14 One time, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, ‘Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.’ 
Gen 30:15 But Leah said to her, ‘Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband, that you would also take away my son’s mandrakes?’ Rachel said, ‘In exchange for your son’s mandrakes, Jacob can sleep with you tonight.’ 
Gen 30:16 So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, ‘You sleep with me tonight, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.’ So he slept with her that night.  ¶ 
Gen 30:17 God heard Leah’s prayer, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
Gen 30:18 Leah said, ‘God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave-girl to my husband’; so she called his name Issachar <sup>[ There is a hire ]</sup>. 
Gen 30:19 Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
Gen 30:20 She said, ‘God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honour me, because I have borne him six sons’; and she called him Zebulun <sup>[ Dwelling ]</sup>. 
Gen 30:21 And afterwards she had a daughter and named her Dinah.  ¶ 
Gen 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel and heard her prayer and gave her a child. 
Gen 30:23 She conceived and gave birth to a son and said, ‘God has taken away my disgrace.’ 
Gen 30:24 She called his name Joseph <sup>[ He will add ]</sup>, saying, ‘the  <c>Lord</c> will add to me another son.’  ¶ 
Gen 30:25 When Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, ‘Send me away, so that I may go to my own place, and to my country. 
Gen 30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, so that I may go; for you know the service which I have rendered you.’ 
Gen 30:27 But Laban said to him, ‘If now I have found favour in your eyes — I have divined that the  <c>Lord</c> has blessed me for your sake. 
Gen 30:28 State exactly to me your wages and I will pay them.’  ¶ 
Gen 30:29 Jacob answered him, ‘You know how I have served you and what your cattle have become under my care; 
Gen 30:30 for it was little which you had before I came, but now it has greatly increased, since the  <c>Lord</c> has blessed you wherever I went. But now, when am I to provide for my own house as well?’ 
Gen 30:31 Laban said, ‘What should I give you?’  ¶ Jacob said, ‘You do not need to give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock; I will again keep it. 
Gen 30:32 If I can go through all your flock today, and remove from it every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these will be my wages. 
Gen 30:33 So my honesty will testify for me later, when you come to inspect my wages: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs has been stolen by me.’ 
Gen 30:34 Laban said, ‘Good, let it be as you say.’ 
Gen 30:35 But he removed that day the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were striped and spotted, every one that had white on it, and all the black ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hands of his sons. 
Gen 30:36 Then he put the distance of a three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.  ¶ 
Gen 30:37 Jacob, however, took fresh rods of white poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white which was in the rods. 
Gen 30:38 He set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink (and they conceived when they came to drink) 
Gen 30:39 so that the flocks conceived before the rods. Therefore the flocks brought forth striped, speckled and spotted offspring. 
Gen 30:40 Jacob separated the lambs, and he set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the black animals in the flock of Laban and he put his own droves apart and did not put them near Laban’s flock.  ¶ 
Gen 30:41 Whenever the stronger animals of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the rods. 
Gen 30:42 But when the animals were weak, he did not put them in. In this way the weaker became Laban’s, and the stronger Jacobs’s.  ¶ 
Gen 30:43 So the man increased in wealth exceedingly, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.  ¶ 
Gen 31:1 Now Jacob heard Laban’s sons say, ‘Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from that which was our father’s he has acquired all these riches.’ 
Gen 31:2 Now Jacob observed that Laban was not so favorably inclined to him as formerly. 
Gen 31:3 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Jacob, ‘Return to the land of your ancestors, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.’ 
Gen 31:4 Then Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were, 
Gen 31:5 and said to them, ‘I see that your father is not so favorably inclined toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has been with me. 
Gen 31:6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 
Gen 31:7 Your father, however, has deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm. 
Gen 31:8 If your father said, “The speckled will be your wages,” then all the flock bore speckled offspring, but if he said: “The striped will be your wages,” then all the flock have striped offspring. 
Gen 31:9 God has taken away the possessions of your father and given them to me. 
Gen 31:10 At the time when the flock breed, I looked up, and saw in a dream, that the he-goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and piebald. 
Gen 31:11 The messenger of God said to me in a dream, “Jacob!” and I said, “Here I am.” 
Gen 31:12 And he said, “Look! All the he-goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and piebald: for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 
Gen 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar of stone, where you made a vow to me. Now arise, leave this land, and return to the land where you were born.”’  ¶ 
Gen 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah answered him, ‘There is no longer any inheritance for us in our father’s house. 
Gen 31:15 Are we not considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us and goes on to consume the money paid for us. 
Gen 31:16 Since all the riches which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children’s, do whatever God has told you to do.’  ¶ 
Gen 31:17 Then Jacob rose up and put his sons and his wives on camels, 
Gen 31:18 and drove away all his cattle and all the cattle which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 
Gen 31:19 And while Laban was gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household gods that were her father’s. 
Gen 31:20 So Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean — he did not tell him that he was going to flee. 
Gen 31:21 So he fled with all he had; crossing the river Euphrates heading towards the hill-country of Gilead.  ¶ 
Gen 31:22 When it was reported to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, 
Gen 31:23 he took his tribesmen with him, and pursued him for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
Gen 31:24 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him, ‘Take care that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.’ 
Gen 31:25 When Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country; and Laban with his relatives encamped in same hill country of Gilead.  ¶ 
Gen 31:26 Laban said to Jacob, ‘What have you done? You have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of war! 
Gen 31:27 Why did you flee secretly, stealing away from me without telling me? I would have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp — 
Gen 31:28 but you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters. You have acted foolishly. 
Gen 31:29 It was in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, “Take care that you do not speak to Jacob, neither good nor bad.” 
Gen 31:30 But now, since you are surely going because you long so earnestly for your father’s house, why have you stolen my gods?’  ¶ 
Gen 31:31 Jacob answered Laban, ‘I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. 
Gen 31:32 The one with whom you find your gods will be put to death; in the presence of our kinsmen investigate for yourself what is with me and take it.’ Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s gods. 
Gen 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s, and into the tent of the two slave-girls, but he did not find his gods. Then he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered Rachel’s. 
Gen 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel’s saddle and was sitting on them, so that when Laban had searched all about the tent, he did not find them. 
Gen 31:35 She said to her father, ‘Do not be angry that I cannot rise before you, my lord, for it is that time of the month that women have.’ And though he searched thoroughly, he did not find the household gods.  ¶ 
Gen 31:36 Then Jacob became angry and challenged Laban. ‘What is my crime?’ he said, ‘What is my offense, that you have pursued hotly after me? 
Gen 31:37 Alhough you have gone through all through my things, what have you found of all your household possessions? Declare it here before my kinsmen and yours, so that they may decide which of us two is in the right. 
Gen 31:38 In all these twenty years that have I been with you, your ewes and she-goats have not miscarried their young, neither did I eat the rams of your flocks. 
Gen 31:39 I did not bring to you the animals which were killed by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it myself; from my hand you required compensation, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
Gen 31:40 This was how I was: in the day the heat consumed me, and by night the frost, and sleep deserted me. 
Gen 31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
Gen 31:42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty. But God has seen my affliction and the labour of my hands, and he rebuked you last night.’  ¶ 
Gen 31:43 Then Laban answered Jacob, ‘The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine, but what can I do today for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne? 
Gen 31:44 Come, let us make a solemn agreement, I and you, and let there be a witness between me and you.’  ¶ 
Gen 31:45 So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar, 
Gen 31:46 and said to the members of his family, ‘Gather stones.’ When they had taken stones and made a heap, they ate there by the heap. 
Gen 31:47 Laban called it Jegar-sahaduthap <sup>[ Heap of witness ]</sup>; but Jacob called it Galeed <sup>[ Heap of witness ]</sup>. 
Gen 31:48 ‘This heap’, Laban said, ‘is witness between me and you today.’ This is why it was called Galeed, 
Gen 31:49 and Mizpah <sup>[ Place of watching ]</sup>, for Laban said, ‘May the  <c>Lord</c> watch between me and you when we are absent one from another, 
Gen 31:50 so that you may not maltreat my daughters nor take other wives besides my daughters. No one is with us; but beware: God is witness between me and you.’  ¶ 
Gen 31:51 Moreover, Laban said to Jacob, ‘See this heap, and the pillar which I have set up between me and you. 
Gen 31:52 This heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I should not pass beyond this heap to you and that you must not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, with hostile intent. 
Gen 31:53 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor’ (the God of their ancestors) ‘judge between us.’ And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.  ¶ 
Gen 31:54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice there on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread, and they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.  ¶ 
Gen 31:55 Then early in the morning Laban arose, and, when he had kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them, he departed and returned to his home.  ¶ 
Gen 32:1 Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met him. 
Gen 32:2 When he saw them, Jacob said, ‘This is God’s camp;’ so he named the place ‘Mahanaim <sup>[ Company ]</sup>.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:3 Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, which is the territory of the Edomites. 
Gen 32:4 He gave them this command, ‘Say to my lord Esau: “Your servant Jacob declares, I have lived with Laban and have stayed until now. 
Gen 32:5 I have oxen and donkeys, flocks and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may win your favour.”’ 
Gen 32:6 The messengers returned to Jacob with the report, ‘We came to your brother Esau, even as he was coming to meet you with four hundred men.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly alarmed and worried. So he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two parts 
Gen 32:8 and said, ‘If Esau comes to the one and attacks and destroys it, then the other which is left can escape.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:9 Jacob also prayed, ‘God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac,  <c>Lord</c> who said to me, “Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do well by you,” 
Gen 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the faithfulness which you have shown to me, your servant. I passed over the Jordan river with only my staff, and now I have these two groups, 
Gen 32:11 deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear that he will come and attack me and kill the mothers and the children. 
Gen 32:12 Remember your promise to make me prosper and my descendants as many as the sand of the seashore, uncountable.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:13 After spending the night there, Jacob took from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau, 
Gen 32:14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
Gen 32:15 thirty milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten young donkeys. 
Gen 32:16 These he put, each drove by itself, in the care of his servants and said to them, ‘Go on before me and leave a space between the droves.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:17 He gave those in front this command: ‘When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, “To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose are these before you?” 
Gen 32:18 then you shall say, “To your servant Jacob; it is a present sent by him to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is just behind us.”’ 
Gen 32:19 Jacob also commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, to make the same answer, 
Gen 32:20 and to say, ‘Jacob himself is just behind us.’ For he said to himself, ‘I will please him with the present that goes before me, and then, when I meet him, perhaps he will welcome me.’ 
Gen 32:21 So he sent the present over before him; but he himself spent that night in the camp.  ¶ 
Gen 32:22 Later that night he rose up and took his two wives, his two slave-girls, and his eleven children, and sent them over the river Jabbok.  ¶ 
Gen 32:23 After he had sent them accross with all his belongings, 
Gen 32:24 Jacob was left alone, and someone wrestled with him until daybreak. 
Gen 32:25 When he saw that he did not win against Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated, as he wrestled with him. 
Gen 32:26 Then he said, ‘Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.’ But Jacob replied, ‘I will not let you go unless you bless me.’ 
Gen 32:27 So he said to him, ‘What is your name?’ He answered, ‘Jacob.’ 
Gen 32:28 Then he said, ‘Your name shall be no longer Jacob, but Israel <sup>[ which means Struggler with God ]</sup>; for you have struggled with God and with mortals and have won.’ 
Gen 32:29 Jacob asked him, ‘Tell me, I pray, your name.’ He said,‘Why do you ask my name?’ So he blessed him there. 
Gen 32:30 Jacob called the place Penuel <sup>[ which means Face of God ]</sup>, for he said, ‘I have seen God face to face, and my life has been saved.’  ¶ 
Gen 32:31 The sun rose as soon as he had passed beyond Penuel, and he limped because of his hip. 
Gen 32:32 This is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle, which is at the socket of the hip, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip on the thigh muscle.  ¶ 
Gen 33:1 When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two slave-girls. 
Gen 33:2 He put the slave-girls and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son Joseph in the rear. 
Gen 33:3 Then Jacob himself went in front of them, and he bowed down to the ground seven times, as he drew near to his brother. 
Gen 33:4 Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms about his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.  ¶ 
Gen 33:5 When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said, ‘Who are these with you?’ Jacob answered, ‘The children whom God has so kindly given me.’ 
Gen 33:6 Then the slave-girls with their children came up and bowed down to the ground. 
Gen 33:7 Leah and her children also came and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed down before Esau.  ¶ 
Gen 33:8 Esau asked, ‘What do you mean by all this company which I met?’ Jacob answered, ‘To win your friendship, my lord.’ 
Gen 33:9 Esau said, ‘I have enough, my brother; keep what you have.’ 
Gen 33:10 But Jacob replied, ‘No, if now I have won your favour, receive this present from me, because seeing your face when you welcomed me was like seeing the face of God. 
Gen 33:11 Take, I beg of you, the gift that I bring to you, for God has been generous to me and I have enough.’ So he urged Esau until he took it.  ¶ 
Gen 33:12 Then Esau said, ‘Let us set out on our way, and let me travel with you.’ 
Gen 33:13 But Jacob replied, ‘My lord knows that the children are delicate, and I have flocks and herds with their young; if they are overdriven one day, all the flocks will die. 
Gen 33:14 Let my lord, I beg of you, go on ahead of me, and I will proceed leisurely by stages according to the pace of the cattle which I am driving and of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.’ 
Gen 33:15 Then Esau said, ‘Let me at least leave with you some of the people who are with me.’ But Jacob replied, ‘What need is there? Let me only enjoy the favour of my lord.’ 
Gen 33:16 So Esau turned back that day on his way to Seir.  ¶ 
Gen 33:17 But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built there a house for himself, and made huts for his cattle; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth <sup>[ Huts ]</sup>. 
Gen 33:18 Now Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-Aram, and encamped before the city. 
Gen 33:19 He bought the piece of ground where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for four hundred shekels; 
Gen 33:20 and he erected there an altar and called it El, God of Israel.  ¶ 
Gen 34:1 Dinah the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of the region. 
Gen 34:2 When Sheeham the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her and violated her, 
Gen 34:3 but his heart was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob — he loved her and spoke endearingly to her. 
Gen 34:4 Therefore Shechem said to his father Hamor, ‘Get me this girl for my wife.’  ¶ 
Gen 34:5 When Jacob heard that Shecham had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob said nothing until they came home. 
Gen 34:6 Meanwhile Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him and with his sons.  ¶ 
Gen 34:7 The sons of Jacob came in from the field, and when they heard the news, the men were indignant and became very angry, because Shechem had committed a shameful crime in raping Jacob’s daughter: such a thing ought never to be done. 
Gen 34:8 Hamor said to them, ‘My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. I beg you: give her to him as a wife 
Gen 34:9 and intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves. 
Gen 34:10 Then you can settle with us, and the land will be open before you. Remain, go about, and settle down in it.’  ¶ 
Gen 34:11 And Shechem said to Dinah’s father and to her brothers, ‘Let me find favour in your sight, and I will give you what you ask of me. 
Gen 34:12 Demand of me an exceedingly large gift for yourselves and a dowry for the bride, and I shall give all you ask of me; only give me the girl for my wife.’  ¶ 
Gen 34:13 Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, declaring, (because he had defiled their sister Dinah), 
Gen 34:14 ‘We cannot do this. We cannot give our sister to someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. 
Gen 34:15 Only on this condition will we make an alliance with you: if you will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised. 
Gen 34:16 Then will we give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and will live with you and we will become one people. 
Gen 34:17 But if you will not listen to us and allow yourselves to be circumcised, then we will take Dinah and be gone.’  ¶ 
Gen 34:18 Their proposal pleased Hamor and his son Shechem. 
Gen 34:19 The young man (who was honored above all the house of his father) did not hesitate to do the thing demanded, because he was smitten with Jacob’s daughter. 
Gen 34:20 Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying, 
Gen 34:21 ‘These men are peaceably disposed toward us, let them remain in the land and go about in it; the land is broad enough for them on every side and in every direction; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
Gen 34:22 Only on this condition will these men consent to settle with us to become one people, namely, that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
Gen 34:23 Shouldn’t their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? Let us make an alliance with them so that they will live with us.’ 
Gen 34:24 Then all who went in and out of the gate of his city agreed with Hamor and Shechem. And every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.  ¶ 
Gen 34:25 On the third day when they were still in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took swords and came upon the city unawares, 
Gen 34:26 and put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went away. 
Gen 34:27 The other sons of Jacob came on the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
Gen 34:28 They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and all that which was in the city and all that which was in the field. 
Gen 34:29 All their wealth, and all their children and their wives, they took captive, and made all that was in the houses their prey. 
Gen 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, ‘You have brought me into trouble, in that you have made me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. Since I have only a few people, if they gather themselves together against me they will attack me — and I and my house will be destroyed.’ 
Gen 34:31 But they replied, ‘Should he have treated our sister like a whore?’  ¶ 
Gen 35:1 Then God said to Jacob, ‘Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.’ 
Gen 35:2 So Jacob said to his household, and to everyone who was with him, ‘Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments. 
Gen 35:3 Let us arise and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the journey which I was making.’ 
Gen 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their possession, and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
Gen 35:5 They set out on their journey, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
Gen 35:6 Then Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is, Bethel). He and all the people that were with him came to Bethel. 
Gen 35:7 He built there an altar, and named the place El-Bethel <sup>[ The God of the house of God ]</sup>; because there God revealed himself to him, when he fled from the presence of his brother. 
Gen 35:8 Then Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried below Bethel under the oak. Therefore its name was called Allon-bacuth <sup>[ Oak of Weeping ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 35:9 God appeared again to Jacob when he came from Paddanaram, and blessed him. 
Gen 35:10 God said to him, ‘Now your name is Jacob: but your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel.’ So he called his name Israel. 
Gen 35:11 God said to him, ‘I am God Almighty; be fruitful and become numerous; a nation and a multitude of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you; 
Gen 35:12 and the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and to your descendants after you.’ 
Gen 35:13 God went up from him at that place where he spoke with him. 
Gen 35:14 Jacob set up at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and poured a drink-offering and oil on it. 
Gen 35:15 Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.  ¶ 
Gen 35:16 Then they set out from Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into a hard and painful labour. 
Gen 35:17 At the hardest, the midwife said to her, ‘Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son.’ 
Gen 35:18 And, as her life was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni <sup>[ Son of my Sorrow ]</sup>; but his father called him Benjamin <sup>[ Son of the right hand ]</sup>. 
Gen 35:19 So Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), 
Gen 35:20 and Jacob set up a pillar on her grave: that is the Pillar of Rachel’s Grave, which stands until this day.  ¶ 
Gen 35:21 Then Israel journeyed, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-Eder <sup>[ Tower of the Flock ]</sup>. 
Gen 35:22 While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah and Israel heard of it.  ¶ Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
Gen 35:23 The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; 
Gen 35:24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 
Gen 35:25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl: Dan and Naphtali; 
Gen 35:26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl: Gad and Asher (these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram).  ¶ 
Gen 35:27 Then Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
Gen 35:28 The length of Isaac’s life was a one hundred and eighty years. 
Gen 35:29 Isaac beathed his last, and was gathered to his father’s kin, old and satisfied with life; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.  ¶ 
Gen 36:1 Now these are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom). 
Gen 36:2 Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 
Gen 36:3 and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
Gen 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; and Basemath bore Reuel; 
Gen 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau that were born to him in the land of Canaan.  ¶ 
Gen 36:6 Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the members of his household and his cattle and all his beasts and all his possessionse which he had gathered in the land of Canaan and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 
Gen 36:7 For their possessions were too many for them to live together; and the land where they sojourned could not support them because of their cattle. 
Gen 36:8 So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir (Esau is Edom).  ¶ 
Gen 36:9 These are the descendants of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir: 
Gen 36:10 these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath. 
Gen 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
Gen 36:12 Timna was the concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz; and she bore Amalek to him. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah. 
Gen 36:13 These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
Gen 36:14 These were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Esau’s wife Zibeon she bore Jeush to Esau, and Jalam, and Korah.  ¶ 
Gen 36:15 These are the chiefs descended from Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 
Gen 36:16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 
Gen 36:17 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
Gen 36:18 These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 
Gen 36:19 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.  ¶ 
Gen 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the original inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, 
Gen 36:21 and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
Gen 36:22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna. 
Gen 36:23 These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 
Gen 36:24 These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of his father Zibeon. 
Gen 36:25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
Gen 36:26 These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. 
Gen 36:27 These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. 
Gen 36:28 These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
Gen 36:29 These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, 
Gen 36:30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.  ¶ 
Gen 36:31 These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the Israelites. 
Gen 36:32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
Gen 36:33 Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
Gen 36:34 Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. 
Gen 36:35 Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead. The name of his city was Avith. 
Gen 36:36 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
Gen 36:37 Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead. 
Gen 36:38 Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
Gen 36:39 Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.  ¶ 
Gen 36:40 These are the names of the chiefs decended from Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 
Gen 36:41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
Gen 36:42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 
Gen 36:43 chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. This was Esau, the father of the Edomites.  ¶ 
Gen 37:1 Jacob made his home in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived as a resident foreigner. 
Gen 37:2 Joseph at the age of seventeen was a shepherd with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s slave wives. He brought a bad report about them to their father. 
Gen 37:3 Now Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves. 
Gen 37:4 When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all his other sons, they hated him and could not speak to him in a friendly manner.  ¶ 
Gen 37:5 Joseph also had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they hated him still more. 
Gen 37:6 This is what he said to them, ‘Hear, if you will, this dream which I have had; 
Gen 37:7 for as we were binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing, while your sheaves came round and bowed down to my sheaf.’ 
Gen 37:8 His brothers said to him, ‘Do you think you will be king over us? And rule us?’ So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words.  ¶ 
Gen 37:9 Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, ‘I have had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.’ 
Gen 37:10 But when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and said, ‘What is this dream that you have dreamed? Am I and your mother and your brothers supposed to bow down to the earth before you?’ 
Gen 37:11 Therefore his brothers envied him; but his father kept the matter in mind.  ¶ 
Gen 37:12 When his brothers went to pasture his father’s flocks in Shechem, 
Gen 37:13 Israel said to Joseph, ‘Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks in Shechem? Come now, I will send you to them.’ Joseph replied, ‘I am ready.’ 
Gen 37:14 So his father said to him, ‘Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me back word.’ So he sent him out from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
Gen 37:15 There a man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man asked him, ‘What are you seeking?’ 
Gen 37:16 He said, ‘I am looking for my brothers; tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.’ 
Gen 37:17 The man said, ‘They have gone away, for I heard them say, “Let us go to Dothan.”’ So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.  ¶ 
Gen 37:18 When they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 
Gen 37:19 They said one to another, ‘See, here comes that master-dreamer. 
Gen 37:20 Come on, let us kill him, and throw him into one of the pits, and then we will say, “A fierce beast has devoured him”; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!’ 
Gen 37:21 Rueben, however, when he heard it, saved him from their hands by saying, ‘Let us not take his life.’ 
Gen 37:22 Reuben also said to them, ‘Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit, that is in the wilderness; but do not harm him,’ He planned to save him from their hands in order to restore him to his father. 
Gen 37:23 Nevertheless, when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his long robe, the robe with sleeves; 
Gen 37:24 and they took him and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty, there being no water in it.  ¶ 
Gen 37:25 Then they sat down to eat bread, and when they looked up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt. 
Gen 37:26 Judah said to his brothers, ‘What do we gain if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
Gen 37:27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do him no violence, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.’ So his brothers listened to him; 
Gen 37:28 and when the Midianite merchants passed by, pulled Joseph up from the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 37:29 When Reuben returned to the pit and found Joseph gone, he tore his clothes in sorrow. 
Gen 37:30 He went back to his brothers and said, ‘The boy is gone! What am I going to do?’  ¶ 
Gen 37:31 Then his brothers took Joseph’s robe, killed a he-goat, dipped the long-sleeved robe in the blood, 
Gen 37:32 tore it and sent it to their father, saying, ‘We found this; see whether it is your son’s robe or not.’ 
Gen 37:33 He recognised it and said, ‘It is my son’s robe! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph without doubt is torn in pieces.’ 
Gen 37:34 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
Gen 37:35 All his sons and his daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, ‘I shall go down to the grave mourning for my son.’ So Joseph’s father wept for him.  ¶ 
Gen 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to one of Pharaoh’s court officials, Potiphar, the captain of the guard.  ¶ 
Gen 38:1 About that time Judah left his kinsmen, and settled near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
Gen 38:2 Judah saw there a daughter of a Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her. He lay with her, 
Gen 38:3 and she conceived, and bore a son, and he named him Er. 
Gen 38:4 Then she conceived again, and bore a son and named him Onan. 
Gen 38:5 She bore still another son, and named him Shelah: and it was at Chezib that she bore him.  ¶ 
Gen 38:6 Now Judah found a wife for Er his eldest son, and her name was Tamar. 
Gen 38:7 But Er, Judah’s eldest son, was wicked in the sight of the  <c>Lord</c>, and the  <c>Lord</c> took his life. 
Gen 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, ‘Go and lie with your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.’ 
Gen 38:9 But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, in order not to raise up offspring for his brother. 
Gen 38:10 What he did was evil in the sight of the  <c>Lord</c>: therefore he took his life also.  ¶ 
Gen 38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, ‘Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah my son is grown up’; for he said to himself, ‘I will not let him marry her, he must not die like his brothers.’ So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.  ¶ 
Gen 38:12 After many days had passed, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to see about his sheep-shearers at Timnah, with his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
Gen 38:13 Someone told Tamar, saying, ‘Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.’ 
Gen 38:14 She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil. She sat, veiled, in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up without her being given to him as wife. 
Gen 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; because she had veiled her face. 
Gen 38:16 So he turned aside to her by the roadside, and said, ‘Permit me, I pray you, to lie with you.’ For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, ‘What will you give me to lie with me?’ 
Gen 38:17 He said, ‘I will send you a young goat from the flock.’ She said, ‘Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?’ 
Gen 38:18 He said, ‘What pledge should I give you?’ And she said, ‘Your seal-ring and your chain and your staff that is in your hand.’ So he gave them to her, and lay with her, and she became pregnant. 
Gen 38:19 And she got up, and went away, and took off her veil, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  ¶ 
Gen 38:20 Now when Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her. 
Gen 38:21 He asked the men of her place, saying, ‘Where is the sacred prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside?’ They replied, ‘There has been no sacred prostitute here.’ 
Gen 38:22 So he returned to Judah, and said, ‘I have not found her; and the men of the place said, “There has been no sacred prostitute here.”’ 
Gen 38:23 Judah said, ‘Let her keep the pledge, otherwise we will be put to shame. I have sent this goat, and you have not found her.’  ¶ 
Gen 38:24 Now after about three months, Judah was told, ‘Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore and is pregnant.’ Judah said, ‘Bring her forth and let her be burnt.’ 
Gen 38:25 But when she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, ‘By the man to whom these things belong, I am with child.’ She also said, ‘Look at them and see if you know whose these are, the seal-ring and the chain and the staff.’ 
Gen 38:26 When Judah recognised them, he said, ‘She is more in the right than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.’ But he did not lie with her again.  ¶ 
Gen 38:27 When her time came to give birth, it was found that twins were in her womb. 
Gen 38:28 While she was in labour, one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound on his hand a bright red thread, saying, ‘This one came out first.’ 
Gen 38:29 But he drew back his hand, and his brother came out, and she said, ‘What a breach you have made for yourself!’ Therefore he was named Perez <sup>[ Breach ]</sup>. 
Gen 38:30 Afterward his brother came out, who had the bright red thread on his hand; therefore he was named Zerah <sup>[ Red ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 39:1 Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officers, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.  ¶ 
Gen 39:2 Now the  <c>Lord</c> was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he remained in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
Gen 39:3 When his master saw that the  <c>Lord</c> was with him and made everything that he undertook prosper, 
Gen 39:4 Joseph won his confidence and became his personal attendant. He also made him overseer of his household and placed all that he had in his care. 
Gen 39:5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the  <c>Lord</c> blessed the Egyptian’s household for Joseph’s sake, and the blessing of the  <c>Lord</c> was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. 
Gen 39:6 Leaving all that he had in Joseph’s charge, he knew nothing about his affairs except about the food which he ate. Also Joseph was handsome and attractive.  ¶ 
Gen 39:7 After these honors had come to Joseph, his master’s wife directed her glances toward him and tried to tempt him. 
Gen 39:8 But he refused, saying to her, ‘See, my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all that he has in my charge. 
Gen 39:9 No one has greater authority in this house than I, and he has kept back nothing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wrong and sin against God?’ 
Gen 39:10 Day after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to her nor accept her advances. 
Gen 39:11 One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and when none of the men of the household were at home, 
Gen 39:12 she caught hold of his garment and tried to seduce him; but he left his garment in her hand and fled out of the house.  ¶ 
Gen 39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled, 
Gen 39:14 she called to her household servants and said to them, ‘See, the master has brought a Hebrew in to insult us. He came to me to rape me, and I screamed loudly; 
Gen 39:15 and when he heard me scream, he left his garment with me and ran out of the house.’ 
Gen 39:16 She kept his garment by her until his master came home; 
Gen 39:17 then she told him the same story, saying, ‘The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult me; 
Gen 39:18 and when I screamed he left his garment with me and fled.’  ¶ 
Gen 39:19 When Joseph’s master heard the statements which his wife made to him, his anger was aroused; 
Gen 39:20 and he took Joseph and put him into the prison, in the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So he was left there in prison. 
Gen 39:21 But the  <c>Lord</c> was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and enabled him to win the favour of the keeper of the prison, 
Gen 39:22 so that he placed all the prisoners in Joseph’s charge and made him responsible for whatever they did there. 
Gen 39:23 The keeper did not have to concern himself about anything Joseph was responsible for, because the  <c>Lord</c> was with him and gave him success in everything he did.  ¶ 
Gen 40:1 Some time after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their master the king of Egypt, 
Gen 40:2 so that Pharaoh was angry with these two officers and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
Gen 40:3 The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he waited on them; 
Gen 40:4 and they remained in confinement for some time.  ¶ 
Gen 40:5 Meanwhile the king of Egypt’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a particular meaning. 
Gen 40:6 When Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they were sad. 
Gen 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officers, ‘Why do you look so sad today?’ 
Gen 40:8 They answered. ‘We have had a dream and there is no one who can interpret it.’ Then Joseph said to them, ‘Do not the interpretations of dreams belong to God? Tell them to me.’  ¶ 
Gen 40:9 Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, ‘In my dream I saw a vine before me, 
Gen 40:10 and on the vine were three branches, and as if budding it put out blossoms and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. 
Gen 40:11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.’  ¶ 
Gen 40:12 Then Joseph said to him, ‘This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days; 
Gen 40:13 within three days Pharaoh will release you from prison and restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. 
Gen 40:14 But when all goes well with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak in my behalf to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house; 
Gen 40:15 for I was unjustly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.’  ¶ 
Gen 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, ‘I also saw something in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head, 
Gen 40:17 and in the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.’ 
Gen 40:18 Joseph answered, ‘This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; 
Gen 40:19 within three days Pharaoh will take off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your flesh.’  ¶ 
Gen 40:20 Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his officials. Then he released the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
Gen 40:21 He restored the chief butler to his office, so that he again gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand, 
Gen 40:22 but the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
Gen 40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.  ¶ 
Gen 41:1 Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the Nile, 
Gen 41:2 he saw coming up from the Nile seven cows, good-looking and fat, and they had been feeding in the river grass. 
Gen 41:3 Then seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, bad-looking and lean, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. 
Gen 41:4 The bad-looking cows ate up the seven good-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.  ¶ 
Gen 41:5 Afterward he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and good, growing up on one stalk. 
Gen 41:6 Also seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up after them. 
Gen 41:7 The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and realised that it was a dream.  ¶ 
Gen 41:8 In the morning Pharaoh’s mind was disturbed; so he sent and called all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him.  ¶ 
Gen 41:9 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, ‘I now must remind you of my offenses: 
Gen 41:10 Pharaoh was very angry with his servants and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. 
Gen 41:11 We both had dreams the same night, each with a special meaning. 
Gen 41:12 There was also with us a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guard; and we told him and he interpreted our dreams to us, to each of us according to his dream. 
Gen 41:13 Our dreams came true exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved his face and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh. 
Gen 41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.’ 
Gen 41:16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, ‘Not I; God only can give Pharaoh a satisfactory answer.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘In my dream as I stood on the bank of the Nile, 
Gen 41:18 I saw seven cows, fat and good-looking, which had been feeding in the river grass. 
Gen 41:19 There came up after them seven more cows, thin, and bad-looking and lean, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt; 
Gen 41:20 and the lean and bad-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows; 
Gen 41:21 and when they had eaten them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were still as bad-looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke. 
Gen 41:22 Again I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one stalk; 
Gen 41:23 then seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprang up after them; 
Gen 41:24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it to me.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, ‘Pharaoh’s two dreams signify the same thing; God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
Gen 41:26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one dream. 
Gen 41:27 The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are also seven years, and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind represent seven years of famine. 
Gen 41:28 That is why I said to Pharaoh, “God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.” 
Gen 41:29 Seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt are coming, 
Gen 41:30 and they will be followed by seven years of famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume all that the land produces; 
Gen 41:31 and plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.  ¶ 
Gen 41:32 ‘The dream came twice to Pharaoh to indicate that its fulfillment is assured and that God will soon make it come true. 
Gen 41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discreet and wise and place him in control of the land of Egypt. 
Gen 41:34 Pharaoh should take action and appoint overseers over the land and collect one-fifth of all the produce of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
Gen 41:35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come and store the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them hold it for food in the cities. 
Gen 41:36 The food will furnish a supply for the land during the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, so that the people of the land will not perish because of the famine.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:37 The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his officials; 
Gen 41:38 and Pharaoh said to his officials, ‘Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?’ 
Gen 41:39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you. 
Gen 41:40 You will be at the head of my dominion, and all my people shall be ruled as you command, only on the throne I will be superior to you.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:41 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘See, I have appointed you over all the land of Egypt.’ 
Gen 41:42 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his finger and put it upon Joseph’s finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a golden collar about his neck. 
Gen 41:43 He also made him ride in the second-best chariot which he had; and they cried before him, ‘Attention!’ So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 41:44 Pharaoh also said to Joseph, ‘I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one may lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.’ 
Gen 41:45 Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Josephs’s authority was over all Egypt, 
Gen 41:46 and so at the age of thirty Joseph was commissioned by Pharaoh, king of Egypt and went out as the head of the land of Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 41:47 In the seven plenteous years there were bountiful harvests, 
Gen 41:48 and Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven plenteous years, which were in the land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city the products of the fields about it. 
Gen 41:49 Joseph stored up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he ceased to keep account, because it could not be measured.  ¶ 
Gen 41:50 Two sons were born to Joseph and Asenath before the year of famine came. 
Gen 41:51 Joseph named the eldest Manasseh <sup>[ Making Forget ]</sup>; for he said, ‘God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s household.’ 
Gen 41:52 He named the second son Ephraim <sup>[ Fruitful ]</sup>; for he said, ‘God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.’  ¶ 
Gen 41:53 When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were over, 
Gen 41:54 the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food, 
Gen 41:55 for when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, ‘Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.’ 
Gen 41:56 So when the famine was universal throughout the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians: but the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
Gen 41:57 The peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe throughout the world.  ¶ 
Gen 42:1 Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, and he said to his sons, ‘Why do you stand looking at each other? 
Gen 42:2 I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy for us, so that we may live and not die.’ 
Gen 42:3 So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
Gen 42:4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s own brother, with his brothers; for he feared that some harm might come to him. 
Gen 42:5 So the sons of Jacob went among others to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  ¶ 
Gen 42:6 Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Therefore Joseph’s brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth. 
Gen 42:7 When Joseph saw his brothers he knew them, but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, ‘Where do you come from?’ They said, ‘From the land of Canaan to buy food.’ 
Gen 42:8 So Joseph recognised his brothers, but they did not know him.  ¶ 
Gen 42:9 Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them and said to them, ‘You spies! You have come to find out the weaknesses of the land.’ 
Gen 42:10 But they said to him, ‘No my lord; your servants have come to buy food. 
Gen 42:11 We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.’ 
Gen 42:12 But he said to them, ‘No, you have come to see the weaknesses of the land.’ 
Gen 42:13 They replied, ‘We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.’ 
Gen 42:14 Joseph said to them, ‘It is just as I said to you, you are spies. 
Gen 42:15 By this you shall be tested: as sure as Pharaoh lives you shall not go away unless your youngest brother comes here. 
Gen 42:16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that it may be proved whether you are telling the truth or not. Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.’ 
Gen 42:17 So he put them all into prison for three days.  ¶ 
Gen 42:18 Then Joseph said to them on the third day, ‘Do this, and live, for I fear God: 
Gen 42:19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain in prison, but you go, carry grain to supply the needs of your households 
Gen 42:20 and bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and you shall not die.’  ¶ 
Gen 42:21 They did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, ‘We are indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw his distress and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen; therefore this trouble has come upon us.’ 
Gen 42:22 Reuben added, ‘Did I not say to you, “Do not sin against the boy,” but you would not listen? Therefore now his very blood is required.’ 
Gen 42:23 They did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had spoken to them through an interpreter. 
Gen 42:24 But he turned away from them and wept; then he turned back and spoke to them, and, taking Simeon from among them, bound him before their eyes. 
Gen 42:25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with grain and to restore each man’s money to his sack and to give them provision for the journey; and it was done to them.  ¶ 
Gen 42:26 So they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed. 
Gen 42:27 When they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw the silver at the top of the sack. 
Gen 42:28 He said to his brothers, ‘My silver has been returned; here it is in my pack.’ They were dismayed and fearful, and said to one another, ‘What has God done to us?’  ¶ 
Gen 42:29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened, saying, 
Gen 42:30 ‘The man who is master in that land spoke harshly to us and imprisoned us as spies. 
Gen 42:31 We said to him, “We are honest men; we are not spies; 
Gen 42:32 we are twelve brothers, sons of the same father; one is no longer living, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.” 
Gen 42:33 But the man who is master in that land said to us, “This is how I will discover if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take the grain to supply the needs of your households and depart. 
Gen 42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men; and I will restore your brother to you and you shall be free to go about in the land.”’  ¶ 
Gen 42:35 As they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man’s purse of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their purses filled with money, they were afraid. 
Gen 42:36 Jacob their father said to them, ‘You have robbed me of my children: Joseph is no longer living and Simeon is no longer here, and you would take Benjamin also. All this misfortune has overtaken me!’ 
Gen 42:37 But Reuben said to his father, ‘You may put my two sons to death, if I do not return him to you. Put him in my charge and I will bring him back to you.’ 
Gen 42:38 But Jacob said, ‘My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he only is left. If harm should come to him on the way by which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.’  ¶ 
Gen 43:1 The famine was severe in the land; 
Gen 43:2 and when Joseph’s brothers had eaten all the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, ‘Go again, and buy us some more grain.’ 
Gen 43:3 But Judah replied, ‘The man warned us: “You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.” 
Gen 43:4 If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and buy you food, 
Gen 43:5 but if you will not let him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, “You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.”’ 
Gen 43:6 Jacob said, ‘Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?’ 
Gen 43:7 They replied, ‘The man asked particularly about us and our relatives, saying, “Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?” So we answered his questions as he asked them. How were we to know that he would say, “Bring your brother down”?’  ¶ 
Gen 43:8 Then Judah said to Israel his father, ‘Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that both we and you and our little ones may live and not die. 
Gen 43:9 I will be surety for him, you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever; 
Gen 43:10 for if we had not lingered, surely we would now have returned the second time.’ 
Gen 43:11 Therefore their father said to them, ‘If it must be so, then do this: take some of the products of the land in your jars and carry down a present to the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
Gen 43:12 Take twice as much money with you, carrying back the money that was returned in your sacks; perhaps there was a mistake. 
Gen 43:13 Take also your brother and go again to the man, 
Gen 43:14 and may God Almighty grant that the man may be merciful to you and release Benjamin and your other brother. But if I am robbed of my sons, I am bereaved indeed!’ 
Gen 43:15 So the men took the present and twice as much money and Benjamin, and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.  ¶ 
Gen 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, ‘Bring the men into the house, kill animals, and prepare the meal, for these men will eat with me at noon.’ 
Gen 43:17 He did as Joseph directed, and brought the men into Joseph’s house. 
Gen 43:18 But the brothers were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house, and they said, ‘We are being brought in on account of the money that was returned in our grain-saeks at our first visit, so that he can overpower and arrest us and take us as slaves, together with our donkeys.’  ¶ 
Gen 43:19 So when they came near to Joseph’s steward, they spoke to him at the door of the house 
Gen 43:20 and said, ‘Oh, my lord, we came down the first time only to buy food; 
Gen 43:21 and when we reached home, we opened our sacks and discovered every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back with us. 
Gen 43:22 We have also brought down with us other money with which to buy food; we do not know who put our money into our sacks.’ 
Gen 43:23 He replied, ‘Be calm, don’t be afraid; your God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks; I received your full payment.’  ¶ Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
Gen 43:24 The steward also conducted the men to Joseph’s house and gave them water with which to wash their feet, and he gave their donkeys fodder. 
Gen 43:25 Then they made ready the present in anticipation of Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat there.  ¶ 
Gen 43:26 When Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they had brought and bowed down low before him. 
Gen 43:27 He asked them regarding their welfare and said, ‘Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still living?’ 
Gen 43:28 They replied, ‘Your servant, our father, is well; he is still alive.’ Then they bowed their heads and made obeisance.  ¶ 
Gen 43:29 When Joseph looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, his own mother’s son, he said. ‘Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?’ and he added, ‘God be gracious to you, my son.’ 
Gen 43:30 Then because he was overcome with emotion for his brother he sought a place to weep; and he went into his room and wept there. 
Gen 43:31 Then he bathed his face and came out and controlling himself he said, ‘Bring on the food.’ 
Gen 43:32 So they brought food for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for to do so is abhorrent to the Egyptians. 
Gen 43:33 Joseph’s brothers were seated before him, the eldest according to his right as the oldest and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at each other in astonishment. 
Gen 43:34 Then Joseph had portions served to them from the food before him; but Benjamin’s portions were five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.  ¶ 
Gen 44:1 Then he gave this command to the steward of his household: ‘Fill the men’s grain-sacks with food, as much as they can carry, 
Gen 44:2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money too that he paid for his grain.’ He did as Joseph commanded.  ¶ 
Gen 44:3 As soon as the morning light appeared, the men were sent away, together with their donkeys. 
Gen 44:4 When they had gone out of the city, but were not yet far away, Joseph commanded his steward, ‘Follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, “Why have you returned evil for good? 
Gen 44:5 Why have you stolen my silver cup, that from which my master drinks and by which he divines the future? You have done wrong in so doing!”’  ¶ 
Gen 44:6 So the steward overtook them and said these words to them. 
Gen 44:7 They said to him, ‘Why does my lord speak such words as this? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! 
Gen 44:8 Remember that we brought back to you from the hind of Canaan the money which we found in our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
Gen 44:9 If one of us is found with the goblet then let him die, and we will be my lord’s slaves.’ 
Gen 44:10 He said, ‘Let it now be as you have said: he with whom it is found will be my slave; but the rest may go free.’ 
Gen 44:11 Then each one hastily took down his sack to the ground and opened it; 
Gen 44:12 and the steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
Gen 44:13 Then they tore their clothes in sorrow, and every man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.  ¶ 
Gen 44:14 When Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they threw themselves before him on the ground. 
Gen 44:15 Joseph said to them, ‘What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can divine secrets?’ 
Gen 44:16 Judah replied, ‘What can we say, my lord? What can we plead or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. See, both we and he also in whose possession the cup was found are my lord’s slaves.’ 
Gen 44:17 But Joseph said, ‘Far be it from me that I should do such a thing! The man in whose possession the cup was found must be my slave; but you yourselves go up in peace to your father.’  ¶ 
Gen 44:18 Then Judah came close to him and said, ‘My lord, let your servant, I beg of you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger be kindled against your servant; for you are as great as Pharaoh. 
Gen 44:19 My lord, you asked us, “Have you a father or a brother?” 
Gen 44:20 And we said to you, “We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. Since his brother is dead, he is the only son of his mother who is left; and his father loves him.” 
Gen 44:21 You said to us, “Bring him down to me, so that I can see him.” 
Gen 44:22 But we said to you, my lord, “The boy cannot leave his father. If he should leave his father, his father would die.” 
Gen 44:23 Then you said to us, “Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not be able to see me again.” 
Gen 44:24 When we went up to your servant, my father, we told him your words, my lord; 
Gen 44:25 and our father said, “Go again, buy us a little food.” 
Gen 44:26 But we said, “We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go; for we cannot see the man unless our youngest brother is with us.” 
Gen 44:27 And your servant, my father, said to us, “You know that my wife bore me two sons; 
Gen 44:28 and one went missing, and I said that surely he was torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since. 
Gen 44:29 If you take this one also from me, and harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.” 
Gen 44:30 Now if I return to your servant, my father, and the boy with whose life his heart is bound up is not with us, 
Gen 44:31 then when he sees that there is no boy, he will die, and we, your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 
Gen 44:32 Indeed, my lord, I personally became surety for the boy to my father, when I said, “If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame in my father’s eyes forever.” 
Gen 44:33 Now therefore let me, I beg of you, remain instead of the boy as your slave, my lord, but let the boy go up with his brothers. 
Gen 44:34 For how can I go up to my father, if the boy is not with me, and see the pain and sorrow that would come upon my father.’  ¶ 
Gen 45:1 Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who were standing by him; so he cried out, ‘Let everyone leave me.’ So nobody stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
Gen 45:2 But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh’s court heard.  ¶ 
Gen 45:3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?’ But his brothers could not answer him for they were frightened in his presence. 
Gen 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘Come near to me, I beg of you.’ So they came near. And he said, ‘I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt. 
Gen 45:5 Do not be troubled nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here, because God sent me before you to preserve life. 
Gen 45:6 For the famine has already been two years in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest. 
Gen 45:7 God sent me before you to keep you alive through a great deliverance and give you descendants on the earth. 
Gen 45:8 So now it clear that it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 45:9 ‘Go up quickly to my father and say to him, “Your son Joseph says: God has made me master of all Egypt, come down to me without delay. 
Gen 45:10 You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me with your children and children’s children, with your flocks and your herds and all that you have, 
Gen 45:11 and there I will provide for you. Otherwise you, together with your household and all that you have, will starve; for there will be five more years of famine.” 
Gen 45:12 Now you and my brother Benjamin see that it is really me, Joseph, who is speaking to you. 
Gen 45:13 Tell my father all about my honour in Egypt and what you have seen, and you must quickly bring him down here.’  ¶ 
Gen 45:14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
Gen 45:15 He also kissed all his brothers and wept with them; and after that his brothers talked with him.  ¶ 
Gen 45:16 The report that Joseph’s brothers had arrived spread in Pharaoh’s palace, and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants greatly. 
Gen 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘Say to your brothers, “Do this: load your beasts, go to the land of Canaan, 
Gen 45:18 and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the best that the land affords. 
Gen 45:19 Now you are commanded to do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come. 
Gen 45:20 Also pay no attention to your household goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.”’ 
Gen 45:21 The sons of Jacob did as commanded.  ¶ So Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharaoh’s orders and provisions for the journey. 
Gen 45:22 To each of them he gave a change of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 
Gen 45:23 To his father he sent the following gifts: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father on the journey.  ¶ 
Gen 45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, ‘See that you do not quarrel on the journey!’ 
Gen 45:25 So they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. 
Gen 45:26 They told him, ‘Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!’ Then Jacob’s heart stood still, for he could not believe them. 
Gen 45:27 But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived, 
Gen 45:28 and he, Israel, said, ‘It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.’  ¶ 
Gen 46:1 Then Israel set out on his journey with all that he had. He went to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
Gen 46:2 God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said, ‘Jacob, Jacob.’ He answered. ‘Here I am.’ 
Gen 46:3 Then God said, ‘I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. 
Gen 46:4 I myself will go down with you into Egypt; and I will surely bring you up again; and Joseph will be the one who closes your dying eyes.’  ¶ 
Gen 46:5 When Jacob left Beersheba, his sons carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
Gen 46:6 They took their herds and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his family; 
Gen 46:7 his sons and grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, he brought all his family to Egypt. 
Gen 46:8 Now these are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his family, who came to Egypt. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, 
Gen 46:9 and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
Gen 46:10 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. 
Gen 46:11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
Gen 46:12 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul. 
Gen 46:13 The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron. 
Gen 46:14 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
Gen 46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah. He had thirty-three descendants by Leah in total. 
Gen 46:16 The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
Gen 46:17 The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
Gen 46:18 These are the children of Zilpah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She bore sixteen children to Jacob. 
Gen 46:19 The children of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
Gen 46:20 Joseph in the land of Egypt fathered Manasseh and Ephraim, whose mother was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
Gen 46:21 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
Gen 46:22 These fourteen were Rachel and Jacobs’s descendants. 
Gen 46:23 The sons of Dan: Hashum. 
Gen 46:24 The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
Gen 46:25 These seven are the sons of Bilhah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore seven children to Jacob.  ¶ 
Gen 46:26 All the people belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including the wives of his sons, were sixty-six in total. 
Gen 46:27 Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt; all the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.  ¶ 
Gen 46:28 Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, so that he might show him the way to Goshen. 
Gen 46:29 When they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father, and when he presented himself to him Jacob fell on his neck and wept there a long time.  ¶ 
Gen 46:30 Then Jacob said to Joseph, ‘Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.’ 
Gen 46:31 But Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, ‘I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, “My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 
Gen 46:32 Now the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all that they have.” 
Gen 46:33 When Pharaoh calls you and asks, “What is your occupation?” 
Gen 46:34 you must say, “We, your servants have been keepers of cattle all our lives, both we and our fathers,” so that you might be allowed to live in the province of Goshen, for shepherds are looked down upon by the Egyptians.’  ¶ 
Gen 47:1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, ‘My father and my brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.’ 
Gen 47:2 He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 
Gen 47:3 Pharaoh said to them, ‘What is your occupation?’ And they said to Pharaoh, ‘We are shepherds, both we and our fathers.’ 
Gen 47:4 They also said to Pharaoh, ‘We have come to live in the land, because there is no pasture for our flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. We beg of you, to let us stay in the province of Goshen.’ 
Gen 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, ‘Since your father and your brothers have come to you, 
Gen 47:6 the land of Egypt is at your disposal. Settle them in the best part of it. Let them stay in the province of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.’  ¶ 
Gen 47:7 Joseph also brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
Gen 47:8 Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, ‘How many years have you lived?’ 
Gen 47:9 Jacob answered, ‘I have lived a hundred and thirty years; few and hard have been the years of my life, and they have not been as many as those that my ancestors lived on earth.’ 
Gen 47:10 After Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh’s presence. 
Gen 47:11 So Joseph gave his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, near Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.  ¶ 
Gen 47:12 Joseph also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his father’s household according to the number of their little children.  ¶ 
Gen 47:13 There was no bread in all the land; since the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. 
Gen 47:14 Joseph gathered in all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.  ¶ 
Gen 47:15 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, ‘Give us bread: for why should we die before your eyes because our money fails?’ 
Gen 47:16 Then Joseph said, ‘Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money has failed.’ 
Gen 47:17 So they brought their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their cattle.  ¶ 
Gen 47:18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, ‘We will not hide from you, my lord, now that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are yours; there is nothing left in the your sight, but our bodies and our lands. 
Gen 47:19 Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Take possession of us and our land in return for bread, and we and our land will become personal possessions of Pharaoh; and give us seed, so that we will live, and not die, so that the land does not become desolate.’  ¶ 
Gen 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s. 
Gen 47:21 As for the people, he reduced them to slavery from one end of Egypt to the other. 
Gen 47:22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had a definite allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Hence they did not sell their land.  ¶ 
Gen 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, ‘I have bought you and you land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land. 
Gen 47:24 At the ingatherings, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed for the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.’ 
Gen 47:25 They replied, ‘You have saved our lives; let us find favour in your sight, lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.’ 
Gen 47:26 So Joseph made it a law, still in force today, that Pharaoh should have a fifth; only the land of the priests did not come into the possession of Pharaoh.  ¶ 
Gen 47:27 The Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired possessions in it and had many children and became exceedingly numerous. 
Gen 47:28 Jacob lived for seventeen years in Egypt and died at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.  ¶ 
Gen 47:29 When the time drew near for Jacob to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, ‘If now you will do me a favour, put your hand under my thigh and swear that you will act kindly and faithfully with me. Do not bury me, I beg of you, in Egypt; 
Gen 47:30 but when I lie down to sleep with my ancestors, carry, me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place.’ Joseph replied, ‘I will do as you have requested.’ 
Gen 47:31 Jacob said, ‘Give me your oath’; so Joseph gave him his oath; and Israel bowed toward the head of the bed.  ¶ 
Gen 48:1 Now after these things, Joseph was told, ‘Your father is sick.’ So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
Gen 48:2 When Jacob was told, ‘Your son Joseph has come to you.’ Jacob rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. 
Gen 48:3 Then Jacob said to Joseph, ‘God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
Gen 48:4 and said to me, “I will make you fruitful, and numerous, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.” 
Gen 48:5 Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
Gen 48:6 But your offspring, which you father after them, will be yours. Their inheritance will come from their older brothers. 
Gen 48:7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, some distance from Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).’  ¶ 
Gen 48:8 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, ‘Who are these?’ 
Gen 48:9 And Joseph said to his father, ‘They are my sons, whom God has given me here.’ Israel said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them. 
Gen 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
Gen 48:11 Israel said to Joseph, ‘I had not thought to see your face; and now God has let me see your offspring as well.’ 
Gen 48:12 Joseph took them from his father’s lap, and bowed with his face to the earth.  ¶ 
Gen 48:13 So Joseph took them both — Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand — and brought them near to him. 
Gen 48:14 Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands intentionally, for Manasseh was the eldest.  ¶ 
Gen 48:15 He then blessed Joseph, saying, ‘The God whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac revered and served, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long unto this day, 
Gen 48:16 the messenger who has delivered me from all evil, bless the boys; and let them be known as descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.’  ¶ 
Gen 48:17 But when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he seized his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s. 
Gen 48:18 Joseph said to his father, ‘Not so, my father; this one is the eldest; put your right hand upon his head.’ 
Gen 48:19 But his father refused and said, ‘I know, my son, I know, he also will become a people, and he will shall be great, but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a populous nation.’ 
Gen 48:20 So he blessed them that day and said, ‘The Israelites will invoke a blessing like your own, saying, “God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.”’ So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.  ¶ 
Gen 48:21 Jacob said to Joseph, ‘See, I am about to die; but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
Gen 48:22 As well I give you a mountain-slope which I took out of the power of the Amorites with my sword and bow.’  ¶ 
Gen 49:1 Jacob summoned his sons and said, ‘Come near, so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.’ <br>	
Gen 49:2 Assemble, sons of Jacob, <br>	and listen to Israel your father. <br><br>	
Gen 49:3 Reuben you are my first-born, <br>	my strength and the first-fruit of my manhood. <br>	First in dignity and strength. <br>	
Gen 49:4 Boiling over like water, you will not be first, <br>	For you climbed into my concubine’s the bed, <br>	you defiled your father’s couch. <br><br>	
Gen 49:5 Simeon and Levi are akin, <br>	weapons of violence are their swords. <br>	I will not enter into their council, <br>	
Gen 49:6 My heart will not join in their assembly, <br>	for men in their anger they slew. <br>	and oxen in their wantonness they hamstrung. <br>	
Gen 49:7 Accursed is their anger that it is so fierce, <br>	and their wrath because it is so cruel; <br>	I will divide them in Jacob <br>	and scatter them in Israel. <br><br>	
Gen 49:8 Judah, your brothers praise you! <br>	Your hand is on the neck of your enemies. <br>	Before you your father’s sons bow down. <br>	
Gen 49:9 Judah is a whelp of a lion. <br>	From the kill, my son, you have returned; <br>	He has crouched, he has lain down as a lion, <br>	as an old lion, who will disturb him? <br>	
Gen 49:10 The sceptre will not pass from Judah, <br>	nor the royal staff from between his feet, <br>	and to him is due the obedience of the people. <br>	
Gen 49:11 Binding his donkey to the vine, <br>	and his colt to the choice vine, <br>	he has washed his garments in wine, <br>	and his clothing in the blood of grapes. <br>	
Gen 49:12 His eyes are red with wine, <br>	and his teeth are white with milk. <br><br>	
Gen 49:13 Zebulun, he lives by the seashore; <br>	he is by a shore that is lined with ships, <br>	and his border extends to Sidon. <br><br>	
Gen 49:14 Issachar, he is a strong-limbed donkey, <br>	crouching down between the sheepfolds, <br>	
Gen 49:15 and when he saw the resting place was good, <br>	that the land also was pleasant, <br>	he bowed his shoulder to bear, <br>	and became a slave under a taskmaster. <br><br>	
Gen 49:16 Dan, he judges his own people <br>	as one of the tribes of Israel. <br>	
Gen 49:17 Dan is a serpent by the way, <br>	a horned-adder beside the path <br>	that bites the horse’s heel <br>	so that his rider is thrown off. <br>	
Gen 49:18 I have waited for your deliverance  <c>Lord</c>! <br><br>	
Gen 49:19 Gad, robber-bands press upon him, <br>	but he also will press upon their heel. <br><br>	
Gen 49:20 Asher, his food is rich, <br>	and he provides royal dainties. <br><br>	
Gen 49:21 Naphtali, he is a flourishing terebinth, <br>	that sends forth beautiful branches. <br><br>	
Gen 49:22 Joseph, he is a fruitful branch, <br>	a fruitful branch by a spring, <br>	his tendrils run over the wall. <br>	
Gen 49:23 They bitterly attack, they shoot at him. <br>	The archers hatefully assail him, <br>	
Gen 49:24 But his bow remains ever bent, <br>	his forearms tireless, <br>	through the power of the Mighty One of Jacob, <br>	In the name of the Shepherd of Israel, <br>	
Gen 49:25 the God of your fathers, who will help you, <br>	and God Almighty, who blesses you, <br>	with blessings of heaven above, <br>	and of the great deep that lies beneath. <br>	With blessings of the breast and womb, <br>	
Gen 49:26 with blessings of your father, <br>	with blessings of the everlasting mountains, <br>	with the gifts of the ancient hills! <br>	They will be on the head of Joseph, <br>	on the head of the consecrated among his brothers. <br><br>	
Gen 49:27 Benjamin is a ravening wolf. <br>	In the morning he devours prey. <br>	and at evening divides the spoil.  ¶ 
Gen 49:28 These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them and blessed them; each according to his blessing he blessed them. 
Gen 49:29 He instructed them, ‘I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
Gen 49:30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for the purpose of holding it as a burying-place. 
Gen 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
Gen 49:32 The field and the cave that is in it which was purchased from the children of Heth.’ 
Gen 49:33 When Jacob had finished giving these instructions to his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his ancestors.  ¶ 
Gen 50:1 Joseph fell upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him.  ¶ 
Gen 50:2 Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Jacob; 
Gen 50:3 and forty days were devoted to it, for this is the full period for embalming. 
Gen 50:4 The Egyptians also mourned for him seventy days.  ¶ 
Gen 50:5 When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the members of Pharaoh’s court, saying, ‘If now you wish to do me a favour, speak to Pharaoh and say, Joseph’s father made him take an oath, saying, “See, I am dying; bury me in my grave which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.” Ask Pharaoh, “Let me go up, I beg of you, and bury my father; after that I will return.”’ 
Gen 50:6 Pharaoh said, ‘Go up and bury your father, as he made you take an oath.’  ¶ 
Gen 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
Gen 50:8 all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their little ones, their sheep, and their cattle they left in the land of Goshen. 
Gen 50:9 There went up with him both chariots and horsemen, so that it was a very great company.  ¶ 
Gen 50:10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, they held there a great and impressive lamentation; and Joseph appointed a period of mourning for his father which lasted seven days. 
Gen 50:11 When the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, ‘This is an impressive mourning among the Egyptians.’ That is why that place across the Jordan is called, Ebel-Mizraim <sup>[ Mourning of the Egyptians ]</sup>.  ¶ 
Gen 50:12 Then Jacob’s sons did for him what he had commanded them: 
Gen 50:13 they carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to hold as a place of burial. 
Gen 50:14 After he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father returned to Egypt.  ¶ 
Gen 50:15 When Joseph’s brothers realised that their father was dead, they said, ‘It may be that Joseph will now hate us and fully punish us for all the evil which we did to him!’ 
Gen 50:16 They sent this message to him: ‘Your father commanded before he died, 
Gen 50:17 “Tell Joseph: Forgive, I beg of you, the wrongdoing and sin of your brothers, for they treated you basely.” So now we beg of you forgive the wrongdoing of the servants of your father’s God.’  ¶ While they were speaking to him, Joseph began to weep, 
Gen 50:18 his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, ‘See, we are your slaves.’ 
Gen 50:19 But Joseph said to them, ‘Do not be afraid; for am I in the place of God? 
Gen 50:20 You plotted mischief against me, but God intended it for good, in order to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of the lives of many people. 
Gen 50:21 Now therefore do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.’ He said this kindly, comforting them.  ¶ 
Gen 50:22 Joseph remained in Egypt with his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years, 
Gen 50:23 and he saw Ephraim’s great-grandchildren; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were borne upon Joseph’s knees.  ¶ 
Gen 50:24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am about to die, but God will surely remember you and bring you up from this land to the land which he promised by an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ 
Gen 50:25 Joseph required an oath of the children of Israel, saying, ‘When God remembers you, as he surely will, then you must carry up my bones from here.’ 
Gen 50:26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.  ¶ 
Josh 1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, 
Josh 1:2 ’Moses my servant is dead; now arise, go over this Jordan with all this people to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites. 
Josh 1:3 Every place upon which the sole of thy foot shall tread, to thee will I give it, as I promised Moses. 
Josh 1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting sun shall be your boundary. 
Josh 1:5 No one shall be able to stand against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee. 
Josh 1:6 Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt bring this people into possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
Josh 1:7 Only be very courageous and strong, to observe faithfully all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have success wherever thou goest. 
Josh 1:8 This law-book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest observe faithfully all that is written in it; for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and shalt have success. 
Josh 1:9 Have I not commanded thee? Be courageous and strong! Fear not, neither be dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou goest.’ 
Josh 1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying, 
Josh 1:11 Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, ’Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as a possession.’ 
Josh 1:12 Also to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said, 
Josh 1:13 Remember the command which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, when he said, ’Jehovah your God is about to bring you to a settled abode and will give you this land.’ 
Josh 1:14 Your wives and your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you; but you – as many of you as are able to fight – shall pass over armed before your kinsmen and shall help them, 
Josh 1:15 until Jehovah hath given a settled abode to your kinsmen as to you and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is about to give them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the rising sun. 
Josh 1:16 And they answered Joshua saying. All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
Josh 1:17 As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses. 
Josh 1:18 Any one who shall rebel against your command and shall not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be courageous and strong. 
Josh 2:1 Then Joshua the son of Nun sent secretly from Shittim two men as spies, saying. Go view the land and especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there. 
Josh 2:2 Now it was told the king of Jericho, saying, There came some men here tonight from the Israelites to explore the land. 
Josh 2:3 And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying. Bring forth the men who have come to you, for they have come to explore all the land. 
Josh 2:4 Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said. It is true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from. 
Josh 2:5 When the time came to shut the gate at nightfall. 
Josh 2:6 She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof. 
Josh 2:7 Accordingly the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan opposite the fords, and as soon as they that pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate. 
Josh 2:8 But before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof, 
Josh 2:9 and said to the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that terror because of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are losing heart before you. 
Josh 2:10 For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 
Josh 2:11 And as soon as we had heard it, we lost heart completely, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah yonr God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth beneath. 
Josh 2:12 Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you will also deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token. 
Josh 2:13 But Rahab said to the men. Swear that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death. 
Josh 2:14 And the men said to her, We will be prepared to forfeit our lives for you, if you do not disclose this business of ours. It shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you. 
Josh 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window (for her house was so close beside the city wall that she dwelt upon the wall). 
Josh 2:16 And she said to them. Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers happen to find you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go on your way. 
Josh 2:17 Then the men said to her. We will be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear. 
Josh 2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down and you shall gather to yourself into the house, your father and your mother and your brothers, and all your father’s household. 
Josh 2:19 And it shall be, if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if any one stays with you in the house, his blood shall be on our heads, if an injury befalls him. 
Josh 2:20 But if you do disclose this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath to which you have made us swear. 
Josh 2:21 And she said. Let it be as you say. So she sent them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet cord in the window. 
Josh 2:22 So they went and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned. Now the pursuers sought for them in every direction, but did not find them. 
Josh 2:23 Then the two men returned, descending from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. 
Josh 2:24 And they said to Joshua, Jehovah hath delivered all the land into our power; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land have lost heart before us. 
Josh 3:1 Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and he and all the Israelites came t the Jodan and spent the night there before they moved over. Then they removed from Shittim. 
Josh 3:2 Now after three days the officers went through the midst of the camp 
Josh 3:3 and commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God and the priest, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it. 
Josh 3:4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have never passed this way before. 
Josh 3:5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you. 
Josh 3:6 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people. 
Josh 3:7 Then Jehovah said to Joshus, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that I will be with thee as I was with Moses, 
Josh 3:8 and thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, you shall stand still in the waters of Jordan. 
Josh 3:9 Joshua also said to the Israelites, Come hither and hear the words of Jehovah your God. 
Josh 3:10 Then Joshua said, By this you shall know that a living God is among you, and that he will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites and the Jebusites. 
Josh 3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan. 
Josh 3:12 Also take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe. 
Josh 3:13 And it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, and they shall rise in a heap. And the waters that come down from above shall stand still. 
Josh 3:14 And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant being before the people, that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan. 
Josh 3:15 And so when those who were crossing carrying the ark came to the Jordan – the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest – therefore when the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water, 
Josh 3:16 the waters which came down from above stood still. Its waters rose up in a heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people stood opposite Jericho. 
Josh 3:17 And the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan. 
Josh 4:1 And it came to pass, when the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan, that Jehovah said to Joshua, 
Josh 4:2 take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe. 
Josh 4:3 Command them saying, Take hence from the midst of the Jordan, (out of the place where the priests’ feet stood) twelve stones, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the camping-place, where you shall pass the night, 
Josh 4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed of the Israelites, a man from each tribe, 
Josh 4:5 and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and let every man of you lift a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites; 
Josh 4:6 that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do you mean by these stones?" 
Josh 4:7 then you shall say to them, "Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off." and these stones shall be for a memorial to the Israelites forever. 
Josh 4:8 And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there. 
Josh 4:9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day. 
Josh 4:10 The priests who carried the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. Then the people passed over quickly. 
Josh 4:11 And it came to pass when all the people had finished the passage, that the ark of Jehovah passed over and the priests, in the presence of the people. 
Josh 4:12 And the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses commanded them; 
Josh 4:13 about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho. 
Josh 4:14 On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. 
Josh 4:15 And Jehovah said to Joshua, 
Josh 4:16 Command the priests who carry the ark of the law, that they come up out of the Jordan. 
Josh 4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan. 
Josh 4:18 And when the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up on the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before. 
Josh 4:19 So the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho. 
Josh 5:1 Now when all the kings of the Amorites, who were to the west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the Israelites, until they were passed over, they lost heart, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the Israelites. 
Josh 5:2 At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make knives of flint, and circumcise again the Israelites the second time. 
Josh 5:3 Then Joshua made him knives of flint and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeah Araloth (The hill of the foreskins). 
Josh 5:4 Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised the Israelites: all the people that came out of Egypt who were males, even all the men capable of fighting, died in the wilderness in the way, on the journey from Egypt. 
Josh 5:5 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness in the way on the journey from Egypt, had not been circumcised. 
Josh 5:6 For the Israelites wandered forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men capable of fighting, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not heed the mice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land concerning which, Jehovah gave oath to their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey.  
Josh 5:7 But their children, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the journey.  
Josh 5:8 Then when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were well again. 
Josh 5:9 And Jehovah said to Joshua, To-day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. So the name of that place has been called Gilgal (Rolling), to this day. 
Josh 5:10 When now the Israelites encamped in Gilgal, they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the mouth in the evening in the plains of Jericho. 
Josh 5:11 And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, on the very same day. 
Josh 5:12 And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 
Josh 5:13 Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And ,Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?  
Josh 5:14 And he said, Nay, but as Prince of the host of Jehovah have I now come. Then Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What has my lord to say to his servant?  
Josh 5:15 And the Prince of Jehovah’s host said to Joshua, Take off thy sandals from thy feet; for the place on which thou art standing is holy. 
Josh 6:1 Now Jericho had closed its gates and was closed on account of the Israelites; no one went out or in. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; and ye shall march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets.  
Josh 6:2 Then Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy power Jericho, and its king, with the men capable of fighting.  
Josh 6:3 And ye shall march around the city, all the warriors going about the city once. Thus shall ye do six days.  
Josh 6:5 And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down of itself. And the seventh day the people shall go up every man straight before him.  
Josh 6:6 Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah,  
Josh 6:7 therefore Joshua said to the people, March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah,  
Josh 6:8 and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before, Jehovah shall pass on, while they blow the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following them,  
Josh 6:9 and the armed men going before the priests who blow the trumpets, and the great multitude following the ark, while they continually blow the trumpets.  
Josh 6:10 Joshua also commanded the people saying, You shall not shout the battle-cry, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word go out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ’Shout the battle-cry;’ then you shall shout.  
Josh 6:11 So he caused the ark of Jehovah to march around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.  
Josh 6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, so the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.  
Josh 6:13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah kept going while they blew the trumpets, the armed men going before them and the rearguard following the ark of Jehovah, blowing trumpets  
Josh 6:14 and the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.  
Josh 6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and when they had made the circuit of the city after the same manner, seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.  
Josh 6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that the priests blew the trumpets; Joshua said to the people, Shout the battle-cry; for Jehovah bath given you the city.  
Josh 6:17 And the city shall be completely devoted to Jehovah, together with all that is in it; only Rahab the harlot shall live, both she and those who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.  
Josh 6:18 Only keep yourselves from that which has been placed under the ban, lest when you have placed it under the ban you take of it, and so bring the camp of Israel under the ban, and trouble it.  
Josh 6:19 But all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron are holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.  
Josh 6:20 So the people shouted the battle-cry, and went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. And when they blew the trumpets, it came to pass, as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down of itself .  
Josh 6:21 Then they completely destroyed by the sword all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass.  
Josh 6:22 Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out from there the woman all that she has, as you took oath to her.  
Josh 6:23 So the young men, the spies. went in and brought Rahab with her father and mother and kinsmen and all that she had. Even all the members of her family they brought out; and they put them in a place of security outside of the camp of Israel.  
Josh 6:24 But they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.  
Josh 6:25 But Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all that she had, Joshua saved; and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel even until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.  
Josh 6:26 At that time Joshua made them subscribe to this oath: Cursed be that man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city: With the loss of his first-born shall he lay its foundation, And with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.  
Josh 6:27 So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.  
Josh 7:1 But the Israelites broke faith in that which had been placed under the ban; for Achan, the son of Carmi. the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which had been placed under the ban; therefore the anger of Jehovah was aroused against the Israelites. 
Josh 7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is on the east side of  Bethel, and commanded them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went and spied out Ai.  
Josh 7:3 And when they returned to Joshua, they said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people toil up there; for they are few. 
Josh 7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; but they fled before the men of Ai.  
Josh 7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them, about thirty-six men. and pursued them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the people lost heart to resist and became as weak as water.  
Josh 7:6 Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before Jehovah until the evening, together with the elders of Israel; and they put  dust upon their heads.  
Josh 7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to bring ns to ruin! would that we had been contented and stayed beyond the Jordan!  
Josh 7:8 O Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel bas turned his back before his enemies!  
Josh 7:9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name? 
Josh 7:10 Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Arise! why art thou lying prostrate thus? 
Josh 7:11 Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them, indeed they have actually taken that which was placed under the ban, and have also been guilty of theft and deception; and they have even put it among their own things.  
Josh 7:12 That is ·why the Israelites cannot stand before their enemies, because they have fa11en under the ban. I will not be with you any more, unless ye destroy from among you that which was placed under the ban.  
Josh 7:13 Arise, sanctify the people, and say, ’Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, "There is in the midst of thee, O Israel, that which was placed under the ban; thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away from among you that which was placed under the ban." 
Josh 7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes; and it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take, shall come near man by man. 
Josh 7:15 And it shall be that he who is taken that which was placed under the ban shall he burnt with fire, together with all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because be has committed a shameful crime in Israel.’ So ,Joshua ’rose up early in the morning. and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. 
Josh 7:17 Then he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites, and he brought near the family of the Zerahites, man by man; and Zabdi was taken.  
Josh 7:18 Then he brought near his household, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zcrah, of the tribe of Judah was taken.  
Josh 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, my son, give, now, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and render praise to him; and tell now what you have done: do not conceal it from me.  
Josh 7:20 And Achan answered Joshua and said, Truly, I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:  
Josh 7:21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver. and a bar of gold of fifty shekels weight, I coveted them and took them, and now they are hidden in the earth in the middle of my tent with the money underneath. 
Josh 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent. and there it was hidden in his tent with the money underneath.  
Josh 7:23 And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and all the Israelites and laid  them down before Jehovah. 
Josh 7:24 Then .Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan  the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep, and his tent and all that he had and brought them to the valley of Achor.  
Josh 7:25 And Joshua said, Why have you brought trouble upon us? Jehovah shall bring trouble upon you today. So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones,  
Josh 7:26 and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Hence the name of the place has been called the valley of Achor (Trouble) to this day.   ¶ 
Ruth 1:1 In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab. 
Ruth 1:2 His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time, 
Ruth 1:3 Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons, 
Ruth 1:4 who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 
Ruth 1:5 Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.  ¶ 
Ruth 1:6 So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the  <c>Lord</c> had remembered his people and given them food. 
Ruth 1:7 As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah, 
Ruth 1:8 Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, ‘Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the  <c>Lord</c> be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me. 
Ruth 1:9 The  <c>Lord</c> grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.’  ¶ Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud 
Ruth 1:10 and said to her, ‘No, we will return with you to your people.’ 
Ruth 1:11 But Naomi said, ‘Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands? 
Ruth 1:12 Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, “I have hope,” even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons, 
Ruth 1:13 would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the  <c>Lord</c> has sent me adversity.’ 
Ruth 1:14 Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.  ¶ 
Ruth 1:15 ‘Look,’ said Naomi, ‘your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!’ 
Ruth 1:16 But Ruth answered, ‘Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God; 
Ruth 1:17 I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the  <c>Lord</c> bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.’ 
Ruth 1:18 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.  ¶ 
Ruth 1:19 So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, ‘Can this be Naomi?’  ¶ 
Ruth 1:20 ‘Do not call me Naomi,’ she said to them, ‘call me Mara <sup>[    In Hebrew ‘Naomi’ means ‘pleasant,’ and ‘Mara’ means ‘bitter.’ ]</sup>, for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot. 
Ruth 1:21 I had plenty when I left, but the  <c>Lord</c> has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the  <c>Lord</c> has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?’ 
Ruth 1:22 So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.  ¶ 
Ruth 2:1 Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz. 
Ruth 2:2 Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, ‘Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.’  ¶ ‘Go, my daughter,’ she replied.  ¶ 
Ruth 2:3 So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 
Ruth 2:4 When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> be with you,’ they answered him, ‘May the  <c>Lord</c> bless you.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:5 ‘Whose girl is this?’ Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers. 
Ruth 2:6 The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, ‘It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab. 
Ruth 2:7 She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls. 
Ruth 2:9 Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:10 Then she bowed low and said to him, ‘Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?’ 
Ruth 2:11 Boaz replied, ‘I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before. 
Ruth 2:12 May the  <c>Lord</c> repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.’ 
Ruth 2:13 Then she said, ‘I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:14 At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, ‘Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.’ So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left. 
Ruth 2:15 When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: ‘Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her. 
Ruth 2:16 Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley. 
Ruth 2:18 Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.  ¶ 
Ruth 2:19 ‘Where did you glean today, and where did you work?’ asked her mother-in-law. ‘A blessing on him who took notice of you!’  ¶ So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. ‘The name of the man with whom I worked today,’ she said, ‘is Boaz.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, ‘May the blessing of the  <c>Lord</c> rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,’ she added, ‘is a near relation of ours.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:21 ‘He told me,’ Ruth said, ‘that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.’  ¶ 
Ruth 2:22 Naomi said to Ruth, ‘It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.’ 
Ruth 2:23 So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.  ¶ 
Ruth 3:1 One day, Naomi said to Ruth, ‘My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous? 
Ruth 3:2 Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours? 
Ruth 3:3 Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 
Ruth 3:4 Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.’  ¶ 
Ruth 3:5 ‘I will do as you say.’ Ruth said to her.  ¶ 
Ruth 3:6 So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her. 
Ruth 3:7 When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down. 
Ruth 3:8 At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet! 
Ruth 3:9 ‘Who are you?’ he said. ‘I am Ruth your servant,’ she answered, ‘Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.’ 
Ruth 3:10 He said, ‘May you be blest by the  <c>Lord</c>, my daughter. You have shown me greater favour now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich. 
Ruth 3:11 My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman. 
Ruth 3:12 Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I. 
Ruth 3:13 Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the  <c>Lord</c> lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.’  ¶ 
Ruth 3:14 So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognise her, for Boaz said, ‘No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.’ 
Ruth 3:15 He also said, ‘Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.’ So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.  ¶ 
Ruth 3:16 When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, ‘Is it you, my daughter?’ Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her. 
Ruth 3:17 ‘He gave me these six measures of barley,’ she said, ‘for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.’  ¶ 
Ruth 3:18 ‘Wait quietly, my daughter.’ Naomi said, ‘Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:1 Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, ‘Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.’ So he stopped and sat down. 
Ruth 4:2 Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, ‘Sit down here.’ So they sat down.  ¶ 
Ruth 4:3 Then he said to the near relative, ‘Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech, 
Ruth 4:4 and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.’  ¶ ‘I will buy it,’ he said.  ¶ 
Ruth 4:5 Then Boaz said, ‘On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:6 ‘I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,’ the near relative said. ‘You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:7 Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel. 
Ruth 4:8 So when the near relative said to Boaz, ‘Buy it for yourself,’ Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.  ¶ 
Ruth 4:9 Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, ‘You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi. 
Ruth 4:10 Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:11 Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, ‘We are witnesses. May the  <c>Lord</c> make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem. 
Ruth 4:12 From the children whom the  <c>Lord</c> will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:13 So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the  <c>Lord</c> gave to her a son. 
Ruth 4:14 Then the women said to Naomi, ‘Blessed be the  <c>Lord</c> who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel. 
Ruth 4:15 This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!’  ¶ 
Ruth 4:16 So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own. 
Ruth 4:17 The women of the neighbourhood gave him a name, saying, ‘A son is born to Naomi!’ They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.  ¶ 
Ruth 4:18 This is the genealogy of Perez: <br>	Perez was the father of Hezron, <br>	
Ruth 4:19 Hezron of Ram, <br>	Ram of Amminadab, <br>	
Ruth 4:20 Amminidab of Nashon, <br>	Nashon of Salmon, <br>	
Ruth 4:21 Salmon of Boaz, <br>	Boaz of Obed, <br>	
Ruth 4:22 Obed of Jesse, <br>	Jesse of David.  ¶ 
1Sam 1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
1Sam 1:2 He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
1Sam 1:3 This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c> of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the  <c>Lord</c> there. 
1Sam 1:4 It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters, 
1Sam 1:5 but to Hannah he used to give a double portion because he loved her. But the  <c>Lord</c> had shut up her womb. 
1Sam 1:6 Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the  <c>Lord</c> had shut up her womb. 
1Sam 1:7 This happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the  <c>Lord</c>, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat. 
1Sam 1:8 But Elkanah her husband said to her, ‘Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:9 So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh, and stood before the  <c>Lord</c>. Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 1:10 She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the  <c>Lord</c> and wept bitterly. 
1Sam 1:11 She vowed a vow, saying, <br>	‘O  <c>Lord</c> of armies! <br>	If you will indeed look on the affliction of your maid-servant, <br>	remember me and not forget your maid-servant, <br>	but will give to your maid-servant a boy <br>	then I will give him to the  <c>Lord</c> all the days of his life. <br>	A razor will not come upon his head.’ <br> ¶ 
1Sam 1:12 While she continued praying before the  <c>Lord</c>, Eli observed her mouth. 
1Sam 1:13 Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman. 
1Sam 1:14 So Eli said to her, ‘How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the  <c>Lord</c>.’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:15 ‘No, my lord,’ Hannah answered, ‘I am an unfortunate woman! I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my heart before the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 1:16 Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:17 Then Eli answered, ‘Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:18 She said, ‘Let your maid-servant find favour in your sight.’ So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.  ¶ 
1Sam 1:19 They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the  <c>Lord</c>, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the  <c>Lord</c> remembered her.  ¶ 
1Sam 1:20 And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and named him Samuel <sup>[    Heb: Asked of God ]</sup>, saying, ‘For I have asked him of the  <c>Lord</c>.’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:21 The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the  <c>Lord</c> the yearly sacrifice and his vow. 
1Sam 1:22 But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, ‘When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he will appear in the presence of the  <c>Lord</c> and will live there forever.’  ¶ 
1Sam 1:23 Elkanah her husband said to her, ‘Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the  <c>Lord</c> establish your word.’  ¶ So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. 
1Sam 1:24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the  <c>Lord</c> in Shiloh. 
1Sam 1:25 They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli. 
1Sam 1:26 She said, ‘Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 1:27 This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the  <c>Lord</c> has granted me my petition which I asked of him. 
1Sam 1:28 Now, I on my part have given him to the  <c>Lord</c>; as long as he lives he is given to the  <c>Lord</c>.’ So she left him there before the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 2:1 And Hannah prayed: <br>	My heart exults in the  <c>Lord</c>, <br>	my strength is exalted in the  <c>Lord</c>; <br>	my mouth laughs at my enemies; <br>	because I rejoice in your salvation. <br><br>	
1Sam 2:2 There is none holy as the  <c>Lord</c>, <br>	there is none like you; <br>	there is no rock like our God. <br><br>	
1Sam 2:3 Do not talk so proudly, <br>	let not arrogance come out of your mouth, <br>	for the  <c>Lord</c> is a God of knowledge, <br>	and by him actions are weighed. <br><br>	
1Sam 2:4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, <br>	and they that stumbled are girded with strength. <br>	
1Sam 2:5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, <br>	and they that were hungry have ceased; <br>	while the barren has borne seven, <br>	she who had many children has languished. <br><br>	
1Sam 2:6 The  <c>Lord</c> kills, and makes alive; <br>	he brings down to the grave, and brings up. <br>	
1Sam 2:7 The  <c>Lord</c> makes poor, and makes rich; <br>	he brings low, he also lifts up. <br>	
1Sam 2:8 He raises up the poor out of the dust, <br>	he lifts up the needy from the garbage heap <br>	to make them sit with princes, <br>	and inherit the throne of glory. <br>	For the pillars of the earth are the  <c>Lord</c>”S, <br>	and he has set the world upon them. <br><br>	
1Sam 2:9 He will guard the feet of his holy ones, <br>	but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness; <br>	for not by strength will humans prevail. <br>	
1Sam 2:10 They who strive with the  <c>Lord</c> will be broken to pieces; <br>	against them will he thunder in heaven. <br>	The  <c>Lord</c> will judge the ends of the earth, <br>	he will give strength to his king <br>	and exalt the power of his anointed.  ¶ 
1Sam 2:11 So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the  <c>Lord</c> in the presence of Eli the priest. 
1Sam 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the  <c>Lord</c>, 
1Sam 2:13 nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, 
1Sam 2:14 and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c> in Shiloh. 
1Sam 2:15 Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, ‘Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.’ 
1Sam 2:16 Should the man, however, say to him, ‘First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,’ he would reply, ‘No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.’ 
1Sam 2:17 The sin of the young men was very great before the  <c>Lord</c>, for the men had contempt for the offering of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 2:18 And Samuel continued ministering before the  <c>Lord</c> – a lad girded with a linen ephod. 
1Sam 2:19 His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1Sam 2:20 And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the  <c>Lord</c>.’ Then they would return to their own home. 
1Sam 2:21 And the  <c>Lord</c> visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew up before the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 2:22 Now Eli was very old; and whenver he heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting, 
1Sam 2:23 he said to them, ‘Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people. 
1Sam 2:24 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of the  <c>Lord</c> spreading abroad. 
1Sam 2:25 If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against the  <c>Lord</c>, who could act as mediator for him?’ Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the  <c>Lord</c> desired to slay them. 
1Sam 2:26 But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of the  <c>Lord</c> and of men.  ¶ 
1Sam 2:27 There came a man of God to Eli and said to him, ‘This is the  <c>Lord</c>’s message: I revealed myself to your father’s house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh’s house, 
1Sam 2:28 and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to your father’s house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire. 
1Sam 2:29 Why do you look with envious eyes on my sacrifices and offerings, and honour your sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?” 
1Sam 2:30 Therefore the  <c>Lord</c> the God of Israel says, “I had indeed thought that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever,” but now the  <c>Lord</c> says, “Far be it from me, for them who honour me I will honour, and they who despise me will be lightly esteemed. 
1Sam 2:31 The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house. 
1Sam 2:32 You will look in affliction and enviously on all the prosperity which I will give Israel, and there will not be an old man in your house forever. 
1Sam 2:33 The only one of you whom I do not cut off from my altar will be spared to weep out his eyes and to wear out his body, and all of your household will die by the sword of men. 
1Sam 2:34 This will be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both will die. 
1Sam 2:35 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire, and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before my anointed forever. 
1Sam 2:36 Anyone who is left in your house will come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and will beg to be given in one of the priests’ offices so that they may eat a morsel of bread.”’  ¶ 
1Sam 3:1 The child Samuel continued ministering before the  <c>Lord</c> in the presence of Eli. The word of the  <c>Lord</c> was rare in those days; there were no frequent visions. 
1Sam 3:2 Once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel place – his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see – 
1Sam 3:3 and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the  <c>Lord</c> where the ark of God was, 
1Sam 3:4 the  <c>Lord</c> called, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ He said, ‘Here I am.’ 
1Sam 3:5 He ran to Eli, and said, ‘Here I am; you called me.’ But he said, ‘I didn’t call, lie down again.’ So he went and lay down. 
1Sam 3:6 Then the  <c>Lord</c> called yet again, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, ‘Here I am; you called me.’ But he answered, ‘I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.’ 
1Sam 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the  <c>Lord</c> neither had the word of the  <c>Lord</c> yet been revealed to him. 
1Sam 3:8 So when the  <c>Lord</c> called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, ‘Here I am; for you called me.’ Then Eli realized that the  <c>Lord</c> was calling the child. 
1Sam 3:9 So Eli said to Samuel, ‘Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, “Speak,  <c>Lord</c>, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
1Sam 3:10 Then the  <c>Lord</c> came, and stood there, and called as at other times, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ And Samuel said, ‘Speak; for your servant is listening.’ 
1Sam 3:11 And the  <c>Lord</c> said to Samuel, ‘See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the ears of everyone who hears it will ring. 
1Sam 3:12 In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end. 
1Sam 3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them. 
1Sam 3:14 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli’s house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.’  ¶ 
1Sam 3:15 And Samuel lay there until the morning. Then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the  <c>Lord</c>. Samuel was afraid to make the known the vision to Eli. 
1Sam 3:16 But Eli called Samuel and said, ‘Samuel, my son.’ He said, ‘I am here.’ 
1Sam 3:17 He said, ‘What is the thing that the  <c>Lord</c> has spoken to you? Hide nothing from me. May God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you.’ 
1Sam 3:18 So Samuel told him everything; and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, ‘It is the  <c>Lord</c>; let him do what seems good to him.’  ¶ 
1Sam 3:19 And Samuel grew, and the  <c>Lord</c> was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. 
1Sam 3:20 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 3:21 And the  <c>Lord</c> again appeared in Shiloh, for the  <c>Lord</c> revealed himself to Samuel, 
1Sam 4:1 and the word of Samuel came to all Israel.  ¶ Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. 
1Sam 4:2 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men. 
1Sam 4:3 But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, ‘Why has the  <c>Lord</c> smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.’ 
1Sam 4:4 So they sent to Shiloh; and took from there the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God. 
1Sam 4:5 When the ark of God the  <c>Lord</c> came to the camp, all Israel shouted such a great shout that the earth rang.  ¶ 
1Sam 4:6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, ‘What does this great shouting in the Hebrew’s camp mean?’ When they learned that the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> had come to the camp, 
1Sam 4:7 they were afraid, and said, ‘These are their gods. They have come to them to the camp. 
1Sam 4:8 Woe to Woe to us! Nothin like this has happened to us before! Who can deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague and pesilence. 
1Sam 4:9 Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, so that you will not become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.’  ¶ 
1Sam 4:10 So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and each fled to his home. There fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
1Sam 4:11 The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished.  ¶ 
1Sam 4:12 A Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head. 
1Sam 4:13 Just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out. 
1Sam 4:14 When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, ‘What is this tumultuous noise?’ The man came quickly and told Eli. 
1Sam 4:15 (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see). 
1Sam 4:16 The man said to Eli, ‘I have come from the battle, for I fled today from the ranks.’ He said, ‘How went the matter, my son?’ 
1Sam 4:17 He that brought the tidings answered, ‘Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.’ 
1Sam 4:18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.  ¶ 
1Sam 4:19 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and near her time. When she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and crouched down and gave birth to a child. 
1Sam 4:20 As she lay dying, the women who stood by her said to her, ‘Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.’ But she neither answered nor heeded. 
1Sam 4:21 She named the child Ichabod, saying, ‘The glory is taken away from Israel,’ meaning the capture of the ark of God, and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 
1Sam 4:22 ‘Glory has left Israel,’ she said, ‘because the ark of God is taken.’  ¶ 
1Sam 5:1 The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1Sam 5:2 Then the Philistines took the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon. 
1Sam 5:3 When the Ashdodites arose early the next day, there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>. They raised up Dagon and set him in his place again. 
1Sam 5:4 But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>. The head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left. 
1Sam 5:5 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but step over it. 
1Sam 5:6 The hand of the  <c>Lord</c> was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its borders. 
1Sam 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, ‘The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.’ 
1Sam 5:8 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, ‘What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?’ They answered, ‘Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.’ So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 
1Sam 5:9 But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the  <c>Lord</c> was against the city – there was a very great panic – and he struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tomors broke out on them. 
1Sam 5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, ‘They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.’ 
1Sam 5:11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, ‘Send away the ark of the God of Israel, let it go back to its own place and not kill us and our people.’ For a deadly panic had seized the entire city. The hand of God was very heavy there. 
1Sam 5:12 The men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven.  ¶ 
1Sam 6:1 The ark of the  <c>Lord</c> was in the country of the Philistines for seven months. 
1Sam 6:2 Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, and said, ‘What should we do with the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>? Show us how we should send it to its place.’ 
1Sam 6:3 They said, ‘If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty. You must return to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you.’ 
1Sam 6:4 Then they were asked, ‘What should the guilt offering be which we should return to him?’ and they said, ‘Five golden tumors, and five golden rats, corresponding to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your lords. 
1Sam 6:5 Therefore you should make images of your tumors, and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you should give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from on you and your gods and your land. 
1Sam 6:6 Why be stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh were stubborn? Remember how he made sport of them until they let Israel go?  ¶ 
1Sam 6:7 So take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows which have never been yoked, and fasten the cows to the cart. But leave their calves behind them at home. 
1Sam 6:8 Take the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a guilt offering in a box at its side. Then send it on its way. 
1Sam 6:9 Watch; if it goes on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it was the  <c>Lord</c> was did us this great harm, but if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that stuck us but it was an accident that happened to us.’  ¶ 
1Sam 6:10 The men did all this. They took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1Sam 6:11 They placed the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> on the cart, and the box with the golden rats and the images of their tumors. 
1Sam 6:12 The cows took a straight course in the direction of Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn left nor right. The lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh. 
1Sam 6:13 The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. They lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it. 
1Sam 6:14 When the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, it stood still there, near a great stone. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 6:15 The Levites took down the ark of the  <c>Lord</c> and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered to the  <c>Lord</c> on that day burnt offerings and ordinary sacrifices. 
1Sam 6:16 When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day.  ¶ 
1Sam 6:17 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the  <c>Lord</c>: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. 
1Sam 6:18 The golden rats correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. A witness is the great stone, by which they set down the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>. To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.  ¶ 
1Sam 6:19 The descendents of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Beth-shemesh, when they welcomed the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>. So he killed seventy of them, and the people mourned because the  <c>Lord</c> had struck the people with such a great slaughter. 
1Sam 6:20 The people of Beth-shemesh said, ‘Who is able to stand before the  <c>Lord</c>, this holy God? To whom can we send him to be rid of him?’ 
1Sam 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, ‘The Philistines have brought back the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>. Come and take it back with you.’  ¶ 
1Sam 7:1 So the people of Kiriath-jearim came, and took the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>, and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 7:2 Many years passed from the time the ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim – twenty years. All the nation of Israel turned to the  <c>Lord</c>, 
1Sam 7:3 and Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, ‘If with all your heart you are returning to the  <c>Lord</c>, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you and direct your hearts towards the  <c>Lord</c> and serve him alone, so that he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.’ 
1Sam 7:4 So the Israelites put away the Baals and the Astartes, and served the  <c>Lord</c> only. 
1Sam 7:5 Then Samuel said, ‘Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with the  <c>Lord</c>.’ 
1Sam 7:6 So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the  <c>Lord</c>, and fasted all day and confessed, ‘We have sinned against the  <c>Lord</c>.’ And Samuel judged the Israelites in Mizpah.  ¶ 
1Sam 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines 
1Sam 7:8 and said to Samuel, ‘Don’t cease to cry to the  <c>Lord</c> our God for us, so that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines.’ 
1Sam 7:9 Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the  <c>Lord</c>, and cried to the  <c>Lord</c> on behalf of Israel, and the  <c>Lord</c> answered him. 
1Sam 7:10 While Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. But the  <c>Lord</c> thundered with a mighty voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. 
1Sam 7:11 The men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them until they were below Beth-car.  ¶ 
1Sam 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer, saying, ‘This is how far the  <c>Lord</c> has helped us.’ 
1Sam 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of the  <c>Lord</c> was against the Philistines as long as Samuel lived. 
1Sam 7:14 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel recovered their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.  ¶ 
1Sam 7:15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1Sam 7:16 He used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he used to judge Israel in all those places. 
1Sam 7:17 But he always returned to Ramah, for there was his home, and there he judged Israel. There he built an altar to the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 8:1 When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 
1Sam 8:2 The eldest was called Joel, and his second was called Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba. 
1Sam 8:3 However his sons did not follow his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice. 
1Sam 8:4 So all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
1Sam 8:5 and they said to him, ‘You have become old and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint for us a king to rule us like all the other nations.’ 
1Sam 8:6 But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, ‘Give us a king to judge us.’ And Samuel prayed to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 8:7 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Samuel, ‘Listen to the voice of the people and all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 
1Sam 8:8 Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to you. 
1Sam 8:9 Listen to what they have to say, but solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who will reign over them.’  ¶ 
1Sam 8:10 Samuel told all the words of the  <c>Lord</c> to the people who were asking him to appoint a king. 
1Sam 8:11 He said, ‘This will be the way of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and cavalry. They will run before his chariots, 
1Sam 8:12 and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the equipment for his chariots. 
1Sam 8:13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers. 
1Sam 8:14 Of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants. 
1Sam 8:15 He will take a tenth of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants. 
1Sam 8:16 He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and your donkeys, and use them for his work. 
1Sam 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his slaves. 
1Sam 8:18 Then you will cry out in that day against your king whom you chose for yourselves, but the  <c>Lord</c> will not answer you in that day.’ 
1Sam 8:19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, ‘No, we must have a king over us, 
1Sam 8:20 so that we will like all other the nations, and so that our king can rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.’ 
1Sam 8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 8:22 And the  <c>Lord</c> said to Samuel, ‘Listen to their voice and make them a king.’ And Samuel said to the people of Israel, ‘Each of your return to your city.’  ¶ 
1Sam 9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth. 
1Sam 9:2 He had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was. He was a head taller than any of the people.  ¶ 
1Sam 9:3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had strayed. Kish said to Saul his son, ‘Take one of the servants with you and go out and find the donkeys.’ 
1Sam 9:4 They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. They passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them.  ¶ 
1Sam 9:5 When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, ‘Come, let us return, or my father will stop thinking of the donkeys and become anxious for us.’ 
1Sam 9:6 But the servant answered, ‘There is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honour. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now, and perhaps he can give us information about the mission on which we are going.’ 
1Sam 9:7 Saul said to the boy, ‘But, suppose we go, what should we take to the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What do we have?’ 
1Sam 9:8 The servant answered Saul again, ‘See I have with me a quarter shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God so that he may give us information regarding our mission.’ 
1Sam 9:9 (Formerly in Israel, when someone went to inquire of God, they said, ‘Come let us go to the seer;’ because what is nowadays called a prophet was previously called a seer). 
1Sam 9:10 Then Saul said to his servant, ‘Your advice is good. Come, let us go.’ So they went to the city where the man of God was.  ¶ 
1Sam 9:11 As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met some young girls going out to draw water and said to them, ‘Is the seer here?’ 
1Sam 9:12 They answered, ‘Yes, he is there ahead of you. Hurry, he has come today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. 
1Sam 9:13 As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he is needed to bless the sacrifice before the guests eat. Now go up, and at this time you will meet him.’ 
1Sam 9:14 So they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place.  ¶ 
1Sam 9:15 Now the  <c>Lord</c> had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation: 
1Sam 9:16 ‘At this time tomorrow I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin and you must anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, because I have seen the suffering of my people, and their cry has reached me.’ 
1Sam 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the  <c>Lord</c> indicated to him, ‘This is the man of whom I spoke to you! He is the one who will rule over my people.’ 
1Sam 9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, ‘Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is.’ 
1Sam 9:19 And Samuel answered Saul, ‘I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you will eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart. 
1Sam 9:20 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them. They have been found. To whom does all that is desirable in Israel belong? Does it not belong to you, and to your ancestral house? 
1Sam 9:21 Saul answered, ‘But I am a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin! Why do you speak like this to me?’  ¶ 
1Sam 9:22 Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons). 
1Sam 9:23 And he said to the cook, ‘Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside.’ 
1Sam 9:24 The cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, ‘See, the meat is served! Eat! It was kept for you until the appointed time, so that you might eat with those whom I have invited.’  ¶ So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
1Sam 9:25 After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down for the night. 
1Sam 9:26 At daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, ‘Get up, so that I can send you on your way.’ So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street.  ¶ 
1Sam 9:27 As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, ‘Tell your servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay here so that I can make known to you the word of God.’  ¶ 
1Sam 10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> has anointed you to be a ruler over his people Israel. You will reign over the people of the  <c>Lord</c> and save them from the power of their enemies all around. This will be the sign that the  <c>Lord</c> has anointed you to be a ruler over his heritage: 
1Sam 10:2 when you go from me today you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, “The donkeys you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the donkeys and is anxious for you, asking, ‘What should I do about my son?’” 
1Sam 10:3 Then you will go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor. There three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 
1Sam 10:4 They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you will take from their hand. 
1Sam 10:5 After that you will come to Gibeah-elohim, where the garrison of the Philistines is. When you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them, and they will be prophesying. 
1Sam 10:6 The spirit of the  <c>Lord</c> will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man. 
1Sam 10:7 When these signs come to you, you will do as the occasion offers, for God is with you. 
1Sam 10:8 You must go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.’  ¶ 
1Sam 10:9 As Saul turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him a change of heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 
1Sam 10:10 On his way to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the spirit of God possessed him, and he prophesied among them. 
1Sam 10:11 When everyone who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, ‘What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?’ 
1Sam 10:12 One of the bystanders answered, ‘Who is their father?’ Therefore it became a proverb, ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’ 
1Sam 10:13 When he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 
1Sam 10:14 Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, ‘Where did you go?’ He said, ‘To find the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel.’ 
1Sam 10:15 And Saul’s uncle said, ‘Tell me what Samuel said to you.’ 
1Sam 10:16 And Saul said to his uncle, ‘He told us that the donkeys were found.’ But about the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing.  ¶ 
1Sam 10:17 Samuel called the people together to Mizpah, 
1Sam 10:18 and said to the Israelites, ‘This is what the  <c>Lord</c> the God of Israel says: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you. 
1Sam 10:19 But today you rejected your God, who has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, “No! You must set a king over us.” Now therefore present yourselves before the  <c>Lord</c> by your tribes and by your clans.’  ¶ 
1Sam 10:20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was picked by lot. 
1Sam 10:21 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their clans, and the clan of the Matrites was picked by lot. He brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was picked, but when they searched for him, him he could not be found. 
1Sam 10:22 So they asked of the  <c>Lord</c> further, ‘Did the man come here?’ And the  <c>Lord</c> answered ‘See, he has hid himself among the baggage.’ 
1Sam 10:23 Someone ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people by a head. 
1Sam 10:24 Said Samuel to the people, ‘Have you seen this man whom the  <c>Lord</c> has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people.’ All the people shouted loudly, ‘Long live the king!’  ¶ 
1Sam 10:25 In this way Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the  <c>Lord</c>. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to their home. 
1Sam 10:26 And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and with him went the warriors whose hearts God had touched. 
1Sam 10:27 But there were some scoundrels who said, ‘How can this man save us?’ They despised him, and brought him no presents.  ¶ 
1Sam 11:1 About a month later Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, ‘Make terms with us and we will serve you.’ 
1Sam 11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, ‘On this condition will I make terms with you: that I gouge out the right eye of each of you and by this bring disgrace on all Israel.’ 
1Sam 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, ‘Give us seven days respite, so that we can send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be no one to save us we will surrender to you.’ 
1Sam 11:4 So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud.  ¶ 
1Sam 11:5 Saul was just coming from the field, driving the oxen. He said, ‘What is the trouble with the people? Why are they weeping?’ Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
1Sam 11:6 The spirit of the  <c>Lord</c> rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused. 
1Sam 11:7 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, ‘Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen!’ Then a terror from the  <c>Lord</c> fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man.  ¶ 
1Sam 11:8 He mustered them in Bezek. The Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
1Sam 11:9 They said to the messengers who came, ‘Say this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance will have come to you.’ So the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh. They rejoiced, 
1Sam 11:10 and said to Nahash, ‘Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you please.’ 
1Sam 11:11 On the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions. They came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and massacred the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. The survivors scattered, so that no two of them were left together.  ¶ 
1Sam 11:12 The people said to Samuel, ‘Who is he who said, “Saul will not reign over us?” Bring the men that we may put them to death!’ 
1Sam 11:13 But Saul said, ‘Today no one will be put to death, because today the  <c>Lord</c> has brought deliverance to Israel.’  ¶ 
1Sam 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, ‘Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.’ 
1Sam 11:15 All the people went to Gilgal. There they made Saul king before the  <c>Lord</c> in Gilgal, and sacrificed peace offerings before the  <c>Lord</c>, and there Saul and all the men of Israel held a great celebration.  ¶ 
1Sam 12:1 Samuel said to all Israel, ‘See, I have listened to you in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. 
1Sam 12:2 From now on, behold the king who will lead you. As for me, I am old and grey, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth to this day. 
1Sam 12:3 Here I am! Testify against me before the  <c>Lord</c>, and before his annointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I oppressed? Whom have I defrauded? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to turn a blind eye? Testify and I will restore it to you.’ 
1Sam 12:4 They said, ‘You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.’ 
1Sam 12:5 So he said to them, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.’ They said, ‘He is witness.’  ¶ 
1Sam 12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt. 
1Sam 12:7 Now therefore take your stand so that I may declare to you before the  <c>Lord</c> all the righteous acts of the  <c>Lord</c>, which he did to you and to your ancestors. 
1Sam 12:8 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your ancestors cried to the  <c>Lord</c>, then the  <c>Lord</c> sent Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors out of Egypt, and settled them in this place. 
1Sam 12:9 But they forgot the  <c>Lord</c> their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of King Jabin of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab. They fought against them, 
1Sam 12:10 and cried to the  <c>Lord</c> and said, ‘We have sinned because we have forsaken the  <c>Lord</c> and served the Baals and the Astartes. Deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.’ 
1Sam 12:11 And the  <c>Lord</c> sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samson, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies surrounding you so that you lived in safety. 
1Sam 12:12 But when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, “No, but a king must reign over us,” although the  <c>Lord</c> your God was your king. 
1Sam 12:13 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for the  <c>Lord</c> has now set a king over you. 
1Sam 12:14 If you will fear the  <c>Lord</c> and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the  <c>Lord</c>, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow the  <c>Lord</c> your God, then it will be well. 
1Sam 12:15 But if you will not listen to the voice of the  <c>Lord</c>, but rebel against the commandment of the  <c>Lord</c>, then will the hand of the  <c>Lord</c> be against you and your king. 
1Sam 12:16 Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing that the  <c>Lord</c> is about to do before your eyes. 
1Sam 12:17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the  <c>Lord</c> to send thunder and rain. You will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the  <c>Lord</c> in asking for a king.’ 
1Sam 12:18 So Samuel called upon the  <c>Lord</c>, and the  <c>Lord</c> sent thunder and rain that day. All the people were greatly afraid of the  <c>Lord</c> and Samuel.  ¶ 
1Sam 12:19 Then all the people said to Samuel, ‘Intercede with the  <c>Lord</c> your God in behalf of your servants so that we do not die, because we have added to all our sins the crime of asking for a king.’ 
1Sam 12:20 But Samuel said to the people, ‘Don’t be afraid, you have indeed done all this evil, but do not turn aside from following the  <c>Lord</c>. Serve the  <c>Lord</c> with all your heart, 
1Sam 12:21 and do not turn aside after useless things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are useless. 
1Sam 12:22 For the  <c>Lord</c> because of his great name will not cast away his people, for the  <c>Lord</c> has undertaken to make you his own people. 
1Sam 12:23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the  <c>Lord</c> in ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way. 
1Sam 12:24 Only fear the  <c>Lord</c> and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see the great things he has done for you. 
1Sam 12:25 But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king will be swept away. 
1Sam 13:1 Saul was … years old when he began to reign, and he reigned … and two years over Israel. <sup>[    The numbers are missing from the text. ]</sup> ¶ 
1Sam 13:2 Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent to their homes. 
1Sam 13:3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the news reached the Philistines that the Hebrews were in revolt. But Saul had in the meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land, 
1Sam 13:4 and all Israel heard the news that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. The people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.  ¶ 
1Sam 13:5 The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel – thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and fighters as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
1Sam 13:6 When the Israelites saw that they were in a strait (for the fighters were hard pressed), they hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits. 
1Sam 13:7 Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.  ¶ 
1Sam 13:8 He waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him. 
1Sam 13:9 So Saul said, ‘Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.’ He offered the burnt-offering. 
1Sam 13:10 Just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Samuel came, and Saul went out to greet him. 
1Sam 13:11 Samuel said, ‘What have you done?’ And Saul said, ‘Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash, 
1Sam 13:12 I said, “Now the Philistines will come down to me at Gilgal, and I will not have appeased the  <c>Lord</c>.” So I felt compelled to offer the burnt-offering.’ 
1Sam 13:13 Samuel said to Saul, ‘You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of the  <c>Lord</c> your God, which he commanded you, then would the  <c>Lord</c> have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 
1Sam 13:14 But now your kingdom will not continue. The  <c>Lord</c> has sought out a man after his own heart, and the  <c>Lord</c> has appointed him a leader over his people, because you have not kept that which the  <c>Lord</c> commanded you.’ 
1Sam 13:15 Then Samuel arose and left Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul, going from Gilgal towards Gibeah of Benjamin.  ¶ Saul counted the people who were with him, about six hundred men. 
1Sam 13:16 Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
1Sam 13:17 Raiding parties came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual, 
1Sam 13:18 and another division turned in the direction of Beth-horon, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.  ¶ 
1Sam 13:19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, ‘The Hebrews must not make swords or spears,’ 
1Sam 13:20 so all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his sickle and his ax and his mattock. 
1Sam 13:21 The charge was two thirds of a shekel for ploughshares and mattocks, and one third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and setting the ox goads. 
1Sam 13:22 So on the day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.  ¶ 
1Sam 13:23 A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash, 
1Sam 14:1 and one day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armour, ‘Come – let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.’ But he did not tell his father. 
1Sam 14:2 Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree at Mignon, and with him were about six hundred men. 
1Sam 14:3 Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the  <c>Lord</c> at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 
1Sam 14:4 Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
1Sam 14:5 One crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:6 Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armour, ‘Come, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the  <c>Lord</c> will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent the  <c>Lord</c> from saving by many or by few.’ 
1Sam 14:7 His armour-bearer said to him, ‘Do whatever your judgment dictates. I am with you, your wish is mine.’ 
1Sam 14:8 Then Jonathan said, ‘We will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them. 
1Sam 14:9 If they say to us, “Stand still until we can reach you,” then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them. 
1Sam 14:10 But if they say, “Come up to us,” then we will go up; for the  <c>Lord</c> has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign to us.’ 
1Sam 14:11 When both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, ‘There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.’ 
1Sam 14:12 The men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, ‘Come up to us so that we can tell you something.’ Then Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, ‘Come up after me, for the  <c>Lord</c> has given them into the hand of Israel.’ 
1Sam 14:13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armour-bearer kept despatching them after him. 
1Sam 14:14 In the first attack Jonathan and his armour-bearer slew about twenty men in an area of about half an acre. 
1Sam 14:15 There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and even the raiders trembled and the earth quaked so that it produced a great panic.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:16 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw the army surging hither and thither. 
1Sam 14:17 Saul said to the people who were with him, ‘Investigate now and see who is gone from us.’ When they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there. 
1Sam 14:18 And Saul said to Ahijah, ‘Bring the ephod here,’ for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel. 
1Sam 14:19 While Saul was speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. So Saul said to the priest, ‘Draw back your hand.’ 
1Sam 14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle, and every man’s sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion. 
1Sam 14:21 The Hebrews who had gone over to the Philistines and joined their the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
1Sam 14:22 Likewise all the Israelites who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, pursued close after them in the battle. 
1Sam 14:23 So the  <c>Lord</c> saved Israel that day, and the battle passed on beyond Beth-aven.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:24 Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies.’ So none of the people tasted food. 
1Sam 14:25 Now there was honeycomb in that country, 
1Sam 14:26 and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
1Sam 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people. He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened. 
1Sam 14:28 Then one of the fighters spoke up, ‘Your father charged the people saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food this day.” So the men are exhausted.’ 
1Sam 14:29 Then said Jonathan, ‘My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1Sam 14:30 If only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines!’  ¶ 
1Sam 14:31 But they struck at the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint, 
1Sam 14:32 and they rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood. 
1Sam 14:33 When Saul was told that the people were sinning against the  <c>Lord</c> in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, ‘Treason! Roll a great stone to me.’ 
1Sam 14:34 And Saul said, ‘Go out among the people and say to them, “Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against the  <c>Lord</c> in eating the flesh together with the blood.”’ All the people brought their oxen that night and slew them there. 
1Sam 14:35 So Saul built an altar to the  <c>Lord</c>. That was the first altar that he built to the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:36 Then Saul said, ‘Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder among them until daybreak, and let us not spare a single man.’ They said, ‘Do whatever you think best,’ but the priest said, ‘Let us first consut God.’ 
1Sam 14:37 So Saul asked of God, ‘Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?’ But there was no answer that day. 
1Sam 14:38 And Saul said, ‘Come here, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt today. 
1Sam 14:39 For as the  <c>Lord</c> lives, who delivered Israel, even if it be in Jonathan my son, that man will surely die.’ But no one of all the people answered him. 
1Sam 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, ‘You will on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.’ The people said to Saul, ‘Do what seems good to you.’ 
1Sam 14:41 Therefore Saul asked the  <c>Lord</c>, God of Israel, ‘Why have you not answered your servant this day? If the guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, the  <c>Lord</c>, God of Israel, give Urim, but if the guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.’ And the lot indicated Jonathan and Saul, and the people were cleared. 
1Sam 14:42 And Saul said, ‘Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom the  <c>Lord</c> indicates, must die.’ The people said to Saul, ‘It must not be so!’ But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was indicated.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, ‘Tell me what you have done.’ And Jonathan told him, saying, ‘I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand, and here I am! I am ready to die.’ 
1Sam 14:44 And Saul said, ‘May God do to me whatever he pleases, you must surely die, Jonathan!’ 
1Sam 14:45 But the people said to Saul, ‘Should Jonathan die who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.’ So the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die. 
1Sam 14:46 Then Saul broke off from pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own country.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:47 When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned he was victorious. 
1Sam 14:48 He did mighty deeds and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal. 
1Sam 14:50 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son Saul’s uncle Ner. 
1Sam 14:51 Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.  ¶ 
1Sam 14:52 The war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would take him into his service.  ¶ 
1Sam 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> sent me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now listen to the words of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 15:2 This says the  <c>Lord</c> of armies: “I have determined to punish the Amalekites for wha they did to Israel, in opposing them as they came up out of Egypt. 
1Sam 15:3 Now go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have. Spare no one but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.”’  ¶ 
1Sam 15:4 So Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 
1Sam 15:5 When Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley. 
1Sam 15:6 Saul said to the Kenites, ‘Go away, withdraw from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.’ So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
1Sam 15:7 And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
1Sam 15:8 He took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword. 
1Sam 15:9 But Saul and his army spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fat beasts, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them. But everything that was worthless and despised they completely destroyed.  ¶ 
1Sam 15:10 Then the word of the  <c>Lord</c> came to Samuel saying, 
1Sam 15:11 ‘I repent of making Saul king, because he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands.’ And Samuel was angry and cried to the  <c>Lord</c> all night. 
1Sam 15:12 Early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, ‘Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument to himself and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.’ 
1Sam 15:13 When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, ‘Blessed be you of the  <c>Lord</c>! I have fulfilled the command of the  <c>Lord</c>.’ 
1Sam 15:14 And Samuel said, ‘What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?’ 
1Sam 15:15 And Saul said, ‘They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best off the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c> your God, and the rest we have completely destroyed.’ 
1Sam 15:16 Then Samuel said to ‘Saul, Stop! and let me tell you what the  <c>Lord</c> has said to me this night.’ He said to him, ‘Speak.’  ¶ 
1Sam 15:17 Samuel said, ‘Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the  <c>Lord</c> anointed you king over Israel, 
1Sam 15:18 and the  <c>Lord</c> sent you on an expedition and said, “Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.” 
1Sam 15:19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the  <c>Lord</c> and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease the  <c>Lord</c>?’ 
1Sam 15:20 And Saul said to Samuel, ‘I have obeyed the voice of the  <c>Lord</c> and have gone on the expedition which the  <c>Lord</c> sent me on and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have completely destroyed the Amalekites. 
1Sam 15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban, to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c> your God in Gilgal.’ 
1Sam 15:22 And Samuel said, ‘Does the  <c>Lord</c> delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of the  <c>Lord</c>? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams. 
1Sam 15:23 For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the  <c>Lord</c>, he has rejected you from being king.’ 
1Sam 15:24 And Saul said to Samuel, ‘I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of the  <c>Lord</c> and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice. 
1Sam 15:25 Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship the  <c>Lord</c>.’ 
1Sam 15:26 But Samuel said to Saul, ‘I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the  <c>Lord</c> and the  <c>Lord</c> has rejected you from being king over Israel.’ 
1Sam 15:27 As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore. 
1Sam 15:28 Then Samuel said to him, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> has today torn the kingdom of Israel from you and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you. 
1Sam 15:29 Moreover the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a mortal that he should change his mind.’ 
1Sam 15:30 Then Saul said, ‘I have sinned, yet honour me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, so that I may worship the  <c>Lord</c> your God.’ 
1Sam 15:31 So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped the  <c>Lord</c>.  ¶ 
1Sam 15:32 Then Samuel said, ‘Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.’ And Agag came to him trembling and said, ‘Surely death is bitter.’ 
1Sam 15:33 Samuel said, ‘As your sword has bereaved women, so will your mother be the most bereaved of women.’ Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the  <c>Lord</c> in Gilgal.  ¶ 
1Sam 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
1Sam 15:35 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now the  <c>Lord</c> repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.  ¶ 
1Sam 16:1 The  <c>Lord</c> said to Samuel, ‘How long will you grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king among his sons.’ 
1Sam 16:2 And Samuel said, ‘How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me?’ But the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘Take a calf with you and say you have come to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 16:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do, and anoint the man whom I name.’ 
1Sam 16:4 So Samuel did that which the  <c>Lord</c> had commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, ‘Do you come in peace?’ 
1Sam 16:5 He said ‘Yes, I have come to sacrifice to the  <c>Lord</c>. Purify yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sacrifice.’ He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.  ¶ 
1Sam 16:6 When they came and he saw Eliab, he said, ‘Surely the  <c>Lord</c>’s annointed is now in presence.’ 
1Sam 16:7 But the  <c>Lord</c> said to Samuel, ‘Pay no attention to his appearance or to the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. The  <c>Lord</c> does not see as humans see, for they look on the outward appearance, but the  <c>Lord</c> looks at the heart.’ 
1Sam 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, ‘Neither has the  <c>Lord</c> chosen this one.’ 
1Sam 16:9 Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath the  <c>Lord</c> chosen this one. 
1Sam 16:10 Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> has not chosen these.’ 
1Sam 16:11 And Samuel said to Jesse, ‘Are these all your sons?’ He said, ‘There is still the youngest, but he is a shepherd with the flock.’ So Samuel said to Jesse, ‘Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here.’ 
1Sam 16:12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was handsome, a youth with beautiful eyes and ruddy cheeks. And the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘Get up, anoint him, for this is the man.’ 
1Sam 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The spirit of the  <c>Lord</c> came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.  ¶ 
1Sam 16:14 Now the spirit of the  <c>Lord</c> had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the  <c>Lord</c> tormented him. 
1Sam 16:15 And Saul’s servants said to him, ‘See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1Sam 16:16 Command your servants who are before and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he will play with his hand, and you will be better.’ 
1Sam 16:17 So Saul said to his servants, ‘Provide me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.’ 
1Sam 16:18 One of the young men answered, ‘I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a good fighter, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and the  <c>Lord</c> is with him.’ 
1Sam 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, ‘Send me David your son, who is with the flock.’ 
1Sam 16:20 And Jesse took ten loaves of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul with David his son. 
1Sam 16:21 So David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul loved him so much that he became one of his armour-bearers, 
1Sam 16:22 and sent a message to Jesse, saying, ‘Let David enter my service, for he has found favour in my sight.’ 
1Sam 16:23 Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:1 Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war. They were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
1Sam 17:2 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle-array against the Philistines. 
1Sam 17:3 The Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them. 
1Sam 17:4 A champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath of Gath and he was over nine feet in height. 
1Sam 17:5 He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was clad with a bronze breastplate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds. 
1Sam 17:6 He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. 
1Sam 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds. His shield-bearer went before him. 
1Sam 17:8 He stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel, ‘Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul’s servants? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 
1Sam 17:9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.’ 
1Sam 17:10 The Philistine said, ‘I have insulted the ranks of Israel today! Give me a man that we may fight together.’ 
1Sam 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. The man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. 
1Sam 17:13 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war. Their names were Eliab, the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1Sam 17:14 David was the youngest. The three eldest had followed Saul, 
1Sam 17:15 while David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:16 The Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand for forty days. 
1Sam 17:17 One day Jesse said to David his son, ‘Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 
1Sam 17:18 But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand and look after your brothers’ welfare and bring back some token of assurance from them.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.’  ¶ 
1Sam 17:20 So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry. 
1Sam 17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army. 
1Sam 17:22 David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the welfare of his brothers. 
1Sam 17:23 Just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before, and David heard them.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:24 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid. 
1Sam 17:25 ‘Have you seen this man who has come up?’ they said, ‘Surely he has come up to insult Israel. Whoever kills him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter and will make his father’s house free in Israel.’ 
1Sam 17:26 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, ‘What should be done for the man who strikes that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God?’ 
1Sam 17:27 The people answered him in the words just given, ‘This is what will be done to the man who kills him.’  ¶ 
1Sam 17:28 Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, ‘Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart. You have come down to see the battle.’ 
1Sam 17:29 David said, ‘What have I done now? It was only a question.’ 
1Sam 17:30 Turning away from him to another, he spoke as before, and the people answered him again as at the first time.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:31 When the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They took him and brought him before Saul. 
1Sam 17:32 David said to Saul, ‘Let not my lord’s courage fail him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.’ 
1Sam 17:33 Saul answered, ‘You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. You are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth.’ 
1Sam 17:34 But David said to Saul, ‘Your servant was a shepherd with his father’s flock, and when a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock, 
1Sam 17:35 I would go out after him and kill him and rescue the lamb from his mouth. If he rose up against me, I would seize him by his jaw and slay him with a blow. 
1Sam 17:36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God. 
1Sam 17:37 The  <c>Lord</c> who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.’ So Saul said to David, ‘Go, and may the  <c>Lord</c> be with you.’  ¶ 
1Sam 17:38 Saul clothed David with his armour, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail. 
1Sam 17:39 David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these because I am not used to them. And he took them off. 
1Sam 17:40 He took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:41 The Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him. 
1Sam 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he had nothing but disdain for him, because he was only a youth with ruddy cheeks, a young man of attractive appearance. 
1Sam 17:43 The Philistine said to David, ‘Am I a dog that you come to me with a stick?’ The Philistine cursed David by his gods, 
1Sam 17:44 and said, ‘Come to me so that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.’ 
1Sam 17:45 Then David answered the Philistine, ‘You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the  <c>Lord</c> of armies, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted. 
1Sam 17:46 Today the  <c>Lord</c> will deliver you into my hands, that I may strike you and cut off your head. I will this day give the dead of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel, 
1Sam 17:47 so that all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear does the  <c>Lord</c> save, for the battle is the  <c>Lord</c>’s and he will give you into our hand.’  ¶ 
1Sam 17:48 When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine. 
1Sam 17:49 David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and struck down the Philistine, killing him, although there was no sword in David’s hand. 
1Sam 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, drawing it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it.  ¶ When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1Sam 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron. 
1Sam 17:53 When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp, 
1Sam 17:54 but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armour in his tent.  ¶ 
1Sam 17:55 When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, ‘Abner, whose son is this lad?’ And Abner said, ‘As you live, O king, I cannot tell.’ 
1Sam 17:56 The king said, ‘Inquire whose son the young man is.’ 
1Sam 17:57 When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand. 
1Sam 17:58 Saul said to him, ‘Whose son are you, my lad?’ And David answered, ‘I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.’ 
1Sam 18:1 Now when David had finished speaking with Saul, the lives of Jonathan and David became bound together, and Jonathon loved him as his own life, 
1Sam 18:2 and so Saul took David that day and would not let him return to his father’s house. 
1Sam 18:3 Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own life. 
1Sam 18:4 He stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. 
1Sam 18:5 And David went out. On every task which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul appointed him over the warriors. He was beloved alike by all the people and by the servants of Saul.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:6 At the return home of the army and David’s return from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals. 
1Sam 18:7 The women sang to each other as they danced, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands.’ 
1Sam 18:8 It made Saul very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, ‘They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?’ 
1Sam 18:9 And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:10 The next day an evil spirit from God came powerfully on Saul, and he prophesied within his house. David played the lyre to him, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand, 
1Sam 18:11 and cast it, thinking, ‘I will pin David to the wall.’ But twice David dodged it.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:12 Saul was afraid of David, because the  <c>Lord</c> was with him and had departed from Saul. 
1Sam 18:13 So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander over a thousand. David went out and came in at the head of his men, 
1Sam 18:14 and he acted wisely and prospered in all his ways, for the  <c>Lord</c> was with him. 
1Sam 18:15 When Saul saw that David acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him. 
1Sam 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at the head of the army.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:17 Then Saul said to David, ‘See my oldest daughter, Merab. I will give her to you as wife, only be a valiant champion and fight the  <c>Lord</c>’s battles.’ For Saul said to himself, ‘I must not raise my hand against him, but let the hand of the Philistines deal with him.’ 
1Sam 18:18 And David replied to Saul, ‘Who am I, and what is my father’s clan in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?’ 
1Sam 18:19 But when the time came that Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:20 Michal, Saul’s daughter, fell in love with David. When they told Saul, he was pleased. 
1Sam 18:21 He thought, ‘I will give her to him, so that she becomes a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.’ Therefore Saul said to David a second time, ‘You will this day be my son-in-law.’ 
1Sam 18:22 Saul commanded his servants, ‘Communicate with David secretly and tell him that the king is pleased with him and all the servants love him, therefore become the king’s son-in-law.’ 
1Sam 18:23 And Saul’s servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, ‘Is it an easy thing in your opinion to become the king’s son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation?’ 
1Sam 18:24 The servants of Saul reported back what David had said. 
1Sam 18:25 And Saul said, ‘Tell David: The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1Sam 18:26 When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king’s son-in-law. Before the appointed time, 
1Sam 18:27 he arose and went together with his men and slew a hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and gave them in full to the king, in order to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. 
1Sam 18:28 When Saul saw and knew that the  <c>Lord</c> was with David and his daughter Michal loved him, 
1Sam 18:29 Saul feared David still more, and from that time was David’s enemy.  ¶ 
1Sam 18:30 The Philistine commanders continued to come out to battle, and as often as they came out, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute.  ¶ 
1Sam 19:1 Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, was very fond of David, 
1Sam 19:2 and told David, ‘Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now, I beg you, take care in the morning and stay in concealment and hide yourself. 
1Sam 19:3 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover I will tell you.’ 
1Sam 19:4 Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, ‘Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good. 
1Sam 19:5 He took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the  <c>Lord</c> wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause?’ 
1Sam 19:6 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and gave an oath, ‘As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, David will not be put to death.’ 
1Sam 19:7 And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as before.  ¶ 
1Sam 19:8 But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him. 
1Sam 19:9 Then an evil spirit from the  <c>Lord</c> came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre. 
1Sam 19:10 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that Saul hurled the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped.  ¶ 
1Sam 19:11 That night Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, ‘If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.’ 
1Sam 19:12 Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped. 
1Sam 19:13 Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat’s hair for its head and covered it with the garment. 
1Sam 19:14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, ‘He is sick.’ 
1Sam 19:15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, ‘Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.’ 
1Sam 19:16 When the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat’s hair for its pillow. 
1Sam 19:17 And Saul said to Michal, ‘Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?’ And Michal answered Saul, ‘He said to me: Let me go, why should I kill you?’  ¶ 
1Sam 19:18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 
1Sam 19:19 When Saul was told thqt David was there at Naioth in Ramah, 
1Sam 19:20 he sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophesied. 
1Sam 19:21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
1Sam 19:22 Then Saul himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern in Secu, he asked, ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ Someone answered, ‘They are at Naioth in Ramah.’ 
1Sam 19:23 But on his journey to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1Sam 19:24 He too stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’  ¶ 
1Sam 20:1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and said, ‘What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin against your father, that he is seeking my life?’ 
1Sam 20:2 He replied to him, ‘Far from it! You will not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me? It can’t be true!’ 
1Sam 20:3 David answered, ‘Your father well knows that I have found favour in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, “Let not Jonathan know this or he will be pained.” Nevertheless as surely as the  <c>Lord</c> lives, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death.’ 
1Sam 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ 
1Sam 20:5 And David answered Jonathan, ‘Tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king. Therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening. 
1Sam 20:6 If your father misses me, then say, “David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.” 
1Sam 20:7 If he says “Good,” then it is well with your servant, but if it arouses his anger, then know that he intends evil on me. 
1Sam 20:8 Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. If there is guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?’ 
1Sam 20:9 And Jonathan said, ‘No! For if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you.’ 
1Sam 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, ‘Who will tell me, if your father answers you harshly?’ 
1Sam 20:11 And Jonathan replied to David, ‘Come, and let us go out into the field.’ So the two of them went out into the field. 
1Sam 20:12 And Jonathan said to David, ‘The  <c>Lord</c>, the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time tomorrow or the next day, and if is well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you. 
1Sam 20:13 May God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. May the  <c>Lord</c> be with you, as he has been with my father. 
1Sam 20:14 If I am yet alive, show me the kindness of the  <c>Lord</c>! But if I should die, 
1Sam 20:15 continue your kindness to my household forever, even if the  <c>Lord</c> has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.’ 
1Sam 20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, ‘May the  <c>Lord</c> seek out the enemies of David.’ 
1Sam 20:17 Jonathan took an oath again with David, because of his love to him. With all his heart he loved him. 
1Sam 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, ‘Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
1Sam 20:19 On the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you should go to the place where you hid yourself the other time, and sit down there beside the heap of stones. 
1Sam 20:20 I will shoot three arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark. 
1Sam 20:21 Then I will send the boy, saying, “Go, find the arrows.” If I say to the boy, “See, the arrows are on this side of you, pick them up!” – then come; for it is safe for you, and, as the  <c>Lord</c> lives, there is no danger. 
1Sam 20:22 But if I say to the boy, “See, the arrows are beyond you,”, go, for then the  <c>Lord</c> sends you away. 
1Sam 20:23 As to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the  <c>Lord</c> is witness between you and me forever.  ¶ 
1Sam 20:24 So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat. 
1Sam 20:25 The king sat upon his seat as usual, on the seat by the wall, with Jonathan opposite, and Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty. 
1Sam 20:26 Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed.” 
1Sam 20:27 But when on the day following the new moon, David’s place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, ‘Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?’ 
1Sam 20:28 And Jonathan answered Saul, ‘David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem, 
1Sam 20:29 for he said, “Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favour in your sight, let me slip away and see my brothers.” Hence he has not come to the king’s table.’  ¶ 
1Sam 20:30  Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, ‘Son of a depraved woman! Don’t I know that you are associated with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
1Sam 20:31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die.’ 
1Sam 20:32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father ‘Why should he be put to death? What has he done?’ 
1Sam 20:33 But Saul lifted up his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death. 
1Sam 20:34 Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him.  ¶ 
1Sam 20:35 In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him. 
1Sam 20:36 He said to his boy, ‘Run, find and the arrows which I shoot.’ As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1Sam 20:37 When the boy came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, ‘Isn’t the arrow beyond you?’ 
1Sam 20:38 Jonathan cried after the boy, ‘Hurry, quick, do not stop!’ So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master. 
1Sam 20:39 But the boy had no knowledge of anything. Only Jonathan and David understood what this meant. 
1Sam 20:40 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, ‘Go, carry them to the city.’ 
1Sam 20:41 As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other. 
1Sam 20:42 Then Jonathan said to David, ‘Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of the  <c>Lord</c> – the  <c>Lord</c> will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’ Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city.  ¶ 
1Sam 21:1 David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, ‘Why are you alone and no one with you?’ 
1Sam 21:2 David answered Ahimelech the priest, ‘The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, “Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you.” I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place. 
1Sam 21:3 Now if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or whatever can be found, give it to me.’ 
1Sam 21:4 The priest answered David, ‘There is no ordinary bread at hand. There is holy bread, but only if the young men have kept themselves from women.’ 
1Sam 21:5 David answered the priest, ‘Women have been kept from us, as always when I set out on an expedition. The weapons of the young men were consecrated even on an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their weapons be holy!’ 
1Sam 21:6 So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presense, that was taken from before the  <c>Lord</c> in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away.  ¶ 
1Sam 21:7 (Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the  <c>Lord</c>. His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul’s herdsmen.) 
1Sam 21:8 David said to Ahimelech, ‘Have you not here at hand a spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter required haste.’ 
1Sam 21:9 The priest said, ‘The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.’ And David said, ‘There is none like that, give it to me.’ 
1Sam 21:10 Then David rose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1Sam 21:11 The servants of Achish said to him, ‘Isn’t this David the king of the land? Was it not of him that they used to sing to each other in the dances, saying, <br>	Saul has slain his thousands, <br>	But David his ten thousands?’ <br> ¶ 
1Sam 21:12 David took these words to his heart and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
1Sam 21:13 He pretended to be insane before them, and raved in their hands and drummed on the doors and let his spittle run down his beard. 
1Sam 21:14 Achish said to his servants, ‘You see plainly that the man is mad; why do you bring him to me? 
1Sam 21:15 Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act the madman in my presence? Should this one come into my house?’  ¶ 
1Sam 22:1 So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s clan heard of it, they went down there to him. 
1Sam 22:2 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him. 
1Sam 22:3 David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, ‘Let my father and my mother shelter with you, until I know what God will do for me.’ 
1Sam 22:4 He left them in the presences of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 
1Sam 22:5 Then the prophet Gad said to David, ‘Do not remain in the stronghold. Depart and go to the land of Judah.’ So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.  ¶ 
1Sam 22:6 When Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered, he was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him. 
1Sam 22:7 Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, ‘Listen Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
1Sam 22:8 Is that why all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity on me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me, as is now the case?’ 
1Sam 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered, ‘I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
1Sam 22:10 He inquired of the  <c>Lord</c> for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.’  ¶ 
1Sam 22:11 Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king. 
1Sam 22:12 Saul said, ‘Listen, son of Ahitub!’ He answered, ‘Here am I, my lord!’ 
1Sam 22:13 And Saul said to him, ‘Why have you conspired against me with the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case?’ 
1Sam 22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, ‘But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king’s son-in-law and captain over your retainers and honoured in your household? 
1Sam 22:15 Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this.’ 
1Sam 22:16 But the king said, ‘You will surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan.’ 
1Sam 22:17 The king said to the runners who stood before him, ‘Turn about and slay the priests of the  <c>Lord</c>, for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me.’ But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, ‘Turn and strike down the priests.’ And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore the ephod. 
1Sam 22:19 The priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep.  ¶ 
1Sam 22:20 One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 
1Sam 22:21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the  <c>Lord</c>. 
1Sam 22:22 David said to Abiathar, ‘I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan. 
1Sam 22:23 Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine. You will be safe with me.’  ¶ 
1Sam 23:1 David was told that Philistines were fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors. 
1Sam 23:2 David inquired of the  <c>Lord</c>, ‘Should I go and attack these Philistines?’ And the  <c>Lord</c> said to David, ‘Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.’ 
1Sam 23:3 But David’s men said to him, ‘Behold we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?’ 
1Sam 23:4 Then David inquired of the  <c>Lord</c> yet again. And the  <c>Lord</c> answered him, ‘Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.’ 
1Sam 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle, inflicting heavy losses on them. In this way David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.  ¶ 
1Sam 23:6 When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand. 
1Sam 23:7 When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, ‘God has sold him into my hand, for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars.’ 
1Sam 23:8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
1Sam 23:9 When David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, ‘Bring here the ephod.’ 
1Sam 23:10 And David said, ‘ <c>Lord</c>, God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me. 
1Sam 23:11 Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?  <c>Lord</c>, God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.’ And the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘He will come down.’ 
1Sam 23:12 Then David said, ‘Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?’ And the  <c>Lord</c> said, ‘They will deliver you up.’ 
1Sam 23:13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and moving from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition. 
1Sam 23:14 So David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hill-country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him continually, but the  <c>Lord</c> did not deliver him into his hand.  ¶ 
1Sam 23:15 Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. At that time, he was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha. 
1Sam 23:16 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, came to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God. 
1Sam 23:17 He said to him, ‘Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you. This Saul my father well knows.’ 
1Sam 23:18 The two of them made a covenant before the  <c>Lord</c>, and David stayed in Horesha, and Jonathan returned home.  ¶ 
1Sam 23:19 Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, ‘Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of Jeshimon? 
1Sam 23:20 Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart’s desire, come down, and it will be our part to deliver him into the king’s hand.’ 
1Sam 23:21 Then Saul said, ‘Blessed may you be of the  <c>Lord</c>, for you have had compassion on me. 
1Sam 23:22 Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is very cunning. 
1Sam 23:23 See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah.’  ¶ 
1Sam 23:24 So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
1Sam 23:25 When Saul and his men went to seek him, David found out and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard, he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon. 
1Sam 23:26 Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them, 
1Sam 23:27 when a messenger came to Saul, saying, ‘Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.’ 
1Sam 23:28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. This is why they call that place the Rock of Divisions. 
1Sam 23:29 David went up from there, and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.  ¶ 
1Sam 24:1 When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, ‘David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.’ 
1Sam 24:2 So Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats’ Crags. 
1Sam 24:3 He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave. And Saul went in to relieve himself, while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave. 
1Sam 24:4 The men of David said to him, ‘See this is the day of which the  <c>Lord</c> said to you, “Behold, I give your enemy into your hand and you will do to him as you please.”’ Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe. 
1Sam 24:5 But afterward David was seized with remorse because he had cut off Saul’s robe. 
1Sam 24:6 He said to his men, ‘The  <c>Lord</c> forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed, to lift my hand against him, since he is the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed.’ 
1Sam 24:7 So David upbraided his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. When Saul rose from the cave and went on his way, 
1Sam 24:8 David also rose after him and went from the cave and cried after Saul, saying, ‘My lord the king.’ When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the earth, and did obeisance. 
1Sam 24:9 And David said to Saul, ‘Why did you listen to the words of the men who said, “See, David seeks to harm you?” 
1Sam 24:10 Today your eyes see that the  <c>Lord</c> gave you into my hand in the cave, but I refused to kill you and had pity on you, and I said, “I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed.” 
1Sam 24:11 Moreover, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor guilt on my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are aiming to take my life. 
1Sam 24:12 May the  <c>Lord</c> judge between me and you, but my hand will not be against you. 
1Sam 24:13 As runs the proverb of the ancients, <br>	Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness. <br> ¶ But my hand will not be raised against you. 
1Sam 24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea? 
1Sam 24:15 The  <c>Lord</c> therefore be judge and decide between me and you and see and plead my cause and obtain justice for me from you.’  ¶ 
1Sam 24:16 Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, ‘Is this not your voice, my son David?’ Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 
1Sam 24:17 He said to David, ‘You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil. 
1Sam 24:18 You have done great good to me in that today, when the  <c>Lord</c> had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me. 
1Sam 24:19 For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound? Therefore may the  <c>Lord</c> reward you richly for what you have done to me this day. 
1Sam 24:20 Now see, I know that you will surely be king, and that through you the kingdom of Israel will be established. 
1Sam 24:21 Swear now therefore to me by the  <c>Lord</c>, that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.’ 
1Sam 24:22 So David took oath to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:1 Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.  ¶ Then David arose and went into the Wilderness of Maon. 
1Sam 25:2 There was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1Sam 25:3 The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was sensible and beautiful, but the man was rough and ill-mannered. He was a Calebite. 
1Sam 25:4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1Sam 25:5 So he sent ten young men, saying, ‘Go up to Carmel and enter Nabal’s house and greet him in my name, 
1Sam 25:6 and say to him and to his clan, “Peace be to you and your house and all that you have. 
1Sam 25:7 Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not jeer at them, and nothing of theirs was missing all the while they were in Carmel. 
1Sam 25:8 Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favour in your eyes, for we have come on a feast day. Give, therefore, whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.”’  ¶ 
1Sam 25:9 When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David and waited as directed. 
1Sam 25:10 But Nabal answered David’s servants, ‘Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Many are the slaves these days who break away, each from his master! 
1Sam 25:11 Should I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not where they came from?’ 
1Sam 25:12 So David’s young men turned back on their way, and came and reported all these words to him. 
1Sam 25:13 And David said to his men, ‘Let every man buckle on his sword.’ Each man buckled on his sword. And David also buckeled on his sword, and there went up after David about four hundred men while two hundred remained with the baggage.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:14 But one of the young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, ‘David has just sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them. 
1Sam 25:15 But the men have been very good to us and we have not been jeered at nor have we missed anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields. 
1Sam 25:16 They were a wall about us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
1Sam 25:17 Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a base scoundrel that no one speak to him.’  ¶ 
1Sam 25:18 Then Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five roasted sheep and five mesures of parched grain and a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on donkeys. 
1Sam 25:19 She said to her young men, ‘Go on before me, I am coming after you.’ But she said nothing about it to her husband Nabal. 
1Sam 25:20 Just as she was riding on the donkey and coming down under cover of the mountain, David and his men were also coming down toward her, so that she met them. 
1Sam 25:21 Now David had said, ‘Surely for nothing did I guard all that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness, so that nothing of all that belongs to him was missing, for he has returned me evil for good. 
1Sam 25:22 God do whatever he will to David, if I leave by daybreak of all who belong to him as much as a single man.’  ¶ 
1Sam 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she alighted quickly from her donkey and fell on her face before David and bowed to the ground. 
1Sam 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, ‘Upon me, my lord, upon me be the guilt. Only let your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your servant. 
1Sam 25:25 Let not my lord pay any attention to that base scoundrel, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he, “Reckless Fool,” is his name and folly is his master, but your maid-servant didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:26 Now my lord, as the  <c>Lord</c> lives and as you live, since the  <c>Lord</c> has kept you from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering yourself by your own hand – and may your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal – 
1Sam 25:27 let this present, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord 
1Sam 25:28 Forgive, I pray the trespass of your servant, for the  <c>Lord</c> will certainly make for my lord a secure house, for my lord is fighting the wars of the  <c>Lord</c>, and no evil will be found in you as long as you live. 
1Sam 25:29 Should a man rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the  <c>Lord</c> your God, but the lives of your enemies will he sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 
1Sam 25:30 When the  <c>Lord</c> has done to my lord all the good that he has promised you and has made you prince over Israel, 
1Sam 25:31 then this will not be a qualm or a burden on the conscience of my lord, that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has delivered himself by his own hand. When the  <c>Lord</c> gives prosperity to my lord, then remember your servant.’  ¶ 
1Sam 25:32 David said to Abigail, ‘Blessed be the  <c>Lord</c>, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, 
1Sam 25:33 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you yourself, who have kept me this day from committing an act of bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. 
1Sam 25:34 For as sure as the  <c>Lord</c>, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from doing you harm, except you had quickly come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by daybreak so much as one man.’ 
1Sam 25:35 So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and to her he said, ‘Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your advice, and granted your request.’  ¶ 
1Sam 25:36 But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk, so that she did not tell him anything at all until day break. 
1Sam 25:37 But then in the morning when the effects of the wine were gone from Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him and he became a stone. 
1Sam 25:38 At the end of about ten days the  <c>Lord</c> struck Nabal, so that he died.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:39 Now when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, ‘Blessed be the  <c>Lord</c> who has avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil. The evil-doing of Nabal the  <c>Lord</c> brought back upon his own head.’ Then David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:40 When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, ‘David has sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife,’ 
1Sam 25:41 She rose and bowed with her face to the earth and said, ‘See, your slave is willing to be a servant to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.’ 
1Sam 25:42 Abigail quickly arose and mounted an donkey, and five maids followed as servants. So she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife.  ¶ 
1Sam 25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. 
1Sam 25:44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim.  ¶ 
1Sam 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, ‘David is hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert.’ 
1Sam 26:2 Accordingly Saul arose, and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand men of Israel, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. 
1Sam 26:3 Saul encamped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah overlooking Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness, 
1Sam 26:4 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come there after him, 
1Sam 26:5 so he arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul lay within the barricade, and the people were encamped around about him.  ¶ 
1Sam 26:6 Then David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, ‘Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?’ And Abishai said, ‘I will go down with you.’ 
1Sam 26:7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him. 
1Sam 26:8 Abishai said to David, ‘God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to strike him twice!’ 
1Sam 26:9 But David said to Abishai, ‘Do not destroy him, for who can lay his hand upon the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed and be innocent?’ 
1Sam 26:10 David said, ‘As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, either the  <c>Lord</c> will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and be destroyed. 
1Sam 26:11 The  <c>Lord</c> forbid that I should lift my hand against the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed, but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go.’ 
1Sam 26:12 So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul’s head and they departed. No man saw it of knew it neither did any awake, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the  <c>Lord</c> had fallen upon them.  ¶ 
1Sam 26:13 Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them. 
1Sam 26:14 And David cried to the army and to Abner, the son of Ner, ‘Do you make no answer Abner?’ Then Abner answered, ‘Who are you that calls to the king?’ 
1Sam 26:15 And David said to Abner, ‘Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord. 
1Sam 26:16 This that you have done is not good. As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the  <c>Lord</c>’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.’ 
1Sam 26:17 Then Saul recognised David’s voice and said, ‘Is this your voice, my son David?’ And David said, ‘It is my voice, my lord the king.’ 
1Sam 26:18 He said, ‘Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty? 
1Sam 26:19 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the  <c>Lord</c> has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it was men, cursed be they before the  <c>Lord</c>, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the  <c>Lord</c>, saying, “Go serve other gods.” 
1Sam 26:20 Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away from the presence of the  <c>Lord</c>, for the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains.’  ¶ 
1Sam 26:21 Then Saul said, ‘I have done wrong. Return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly.’ 
1Sam 26:22 And David answered, ‘There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it. 
1Sam 26:23 And the  <c>Lord</c> will reward each man’s righteousness and fidelity, for the  <c>Lord</c> delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the  <c>Lord</c>’a anointed. 
1Sam 26:24 Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the  <c>Lord</c>’s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction.’ 
1Sam 26:25 Then Saul said to David, ‘Be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and will surely succeed!’ So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place.  ¶ 
1Sam 27:1 Then David said to himself, ‘I will be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.’ 
1Sam 27:2 So David set out, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1Sam 27:3 David stayed with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow. 
1Sam 27:4 When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more.  ¶ 
1Sam 27:5 David Said to Achish, ‘If now I have found favour in your sight, let a place in one of the towns in the open country be given me, that I may live there, for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?’ 
1Sam 27:6 So Achish gave him Ziklag at that time, therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day. 
1Sam 27:7 The length of the time that David lived in the open country of the Philistines was a year and four months.  ¶ 
1Sam 27:8 David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these tribes live in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt. 
1Sam 27:9 As often as David struck the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish. 
1Sam 27:10 When Achish said, ‘Where have you made a raid today?’ David answered, ‘Against the Negreb of Judah’, or ‘against the Negreb of the Jerahmeelites’, or ‘against the Negreb of the Kenites.’ 
1Sam 27:11 But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, ‘They might give information against us and say, “David has done this, or that.”’ Such was his custom all the while he lived in the open country of the Philistines. 
1Sam 27:12 And Achish trusted David, thinking, ‘He has brought himself into ill odour with his people Israel, therefore he will be my servant forever.’  ¶ 
1Sam 28:1 Now in those days the Philistines assembled their forces to make a campaign against Israel. Achish said to David, ‘You know thqt you must, together with your men,  go with me along with the forces.’ 
1Sam 28:2 David said to Achish, ‘Good, you will now know what your servant can do.’ And Achish said to David, ‘I will make you my bodyguard from this time on.’  ¶ 
1Sam 28:3 Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had banished the mediums and magicians out of the land. 
1Sam 28:4 When the Philistines assembled and came and encamped in Shunem, Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa. 
1Sam 28:5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart was filled with apprehension. 
1Sam 28:6 Saul inquired of the  <c>Lord</c>, but the  <c>Lord</c> did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets. 
1Sam 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, ‘Find for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire through her.’ His servants said to him, ‘Behold, there is a medium at Endor.’  ¶ 
1Sam 28:8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, taking two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. He said, ‘Tell my future by consulting the dead, call up for me the one whom I name to you.’ 
1Sam 28:9 The woman said to him, Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has banished the mediums and the magicians from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to put me to death?’ 
1Sam 28:10 And Saul swore to her by the  <c>Lord</c>, saying, ‘As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, no guilt will come upon you for this.’ 
1Sam 28:11 Then the woman said, ‘Whom should I bring up to you?’ He said, ‘Bring up Samuel.’ 
1Sam 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. The woman said to Saul, ‘Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul?’ 
1Sam 28:13 The king said to her, ‘Do not be afraid! What do you see?’ The woman said to Saul, ‘I see a god coming up out of the earth.’ 
1Sam 28:14 He said to her, ‘What is his appearance?’ She said, ‘An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.’ Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the earth in respect.  ¶ 
1Sam 28:15 Samuel said to Saul, ‘Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?’ And Saul answered, ‘I am in great trouble, for the Philistines are making war against me and God has turned from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have called you to tell me what I should do.’ 
1Sam 28:16 And Samuel said, ‘Why do you ask of me when the  <c>Lord</c> has turned from you and become your adversary? 
1Sam 28:17 The  <c>Lord</c> has done to you as he declared by me, and the  <c>Lord</c> has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbour, David. 
1Sam 28:18 Because you did not heed the voice of the  <c>Lord</c>, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, the  <c>Lord</c> has done this thing to you today. 
1Sam 28:19 The  <c>Lord</c> will deliver Israel into the power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the  <c>Lord</c> will deliver the army of Israel into the power of the Philistines.’  ¶ 
1Sam 28:20 Then Saul fell at once at full length upon the earth and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel, and he had no strength in him, for he had not eaten bread during all the day and all the night. 
1Sam 28:21 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, ‘Your servant has heeded your voice, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. 
1Sam 28:22 Now therefore, listen also to the advice of your servant and let me set before you a morsel of meat, and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way.’ 
1Sam 28:23 But he refused, and said, ‘I will not eat.’ But his servants, together with the woman urged him, until he listened to their advice. So he rose from the earth and sat upon the couch. 
1Sam 28:24 The woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and took flour and kneaded it and baked from it unleavened bread. 
1Sam 28:25 She set it before Saul and his servants and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.  ¶ 
1Sam 29:1 The Philistines had assembled their forces at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel. 
1Sam 29:2 The lords of the Philistines were marching past, with hundreds and with thousands, and David and his men marched in the rear guard with Achish. 
1Sam 29:3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, ‘What are these Hebrews doing here?’ And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, ‘This is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has now been with me two years, and I have found no fault in him from the time that he came over to me to the present.’ 
1Sam 29:4 But the commanders of the Philistines were enraged against him, and said, ‘Send back the man so that he may return to the place where you have stationed him. Don’t let him go down with us to battle – he might become an adversary to us. How could this fellow better ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of our men? 
1Sam 29:5 Is this not the David of whom they sang responsively in the dances, saying, <br>	Saul has slain his thousands, <br>	But David his ten thousands?’ <br> ¶ 
1Sam 29:6 Then Achish called to David and said to him, ‘As the  <c>Lord</c> lives, you are upright, and it is my desire that you should go out and fight with me, for I have found no evil in you from the time that you came to me to the present, but you are not regarded favourably by the lords. 
1Sam 29:7 Therefore now return and go in peace, so that you do nothing to displease the lords of the Philistines.’ 
1Sam 29:8 David said to Achish, ‘But what have I done? What have you found in your servant fromt the day that I entered into your service to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?’ 
1Sam 29:9 And Achish answered David, ‘I know that you are as good in my sight as a Messenger of God, but the commanders of the Philistines have said, “He must not go up with us to the battle.” 
1Sam 29:10 Therefore now rise early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place where I have stationed you, and do not entertain any evil design in your heart, for you are good in my sight, but rise early in the morning and as soon as it is light, depart.’ 
1Sam 29:11 So David rose early, together with his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.  ¶ 
1Sam 30:1 Now when David and his men  on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South Country and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burnt it down, 
1Sam 30:2 and had carried away captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way. 
1Sam 30:3 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive. 
1Sam 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him wept aloud until they were no longer able to weep. 
1Sam 30:5 David’s two wives had been take captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
1Sam 30:6 David was in great trouble, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the spirit of all the people was embittered, each for his sons and for his daughters.  ¶ David strengthened himself in reliance on the  <c>Lord</c> his God, 
1Sam 30:7 and said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, ‘Bring here to me the ephod.’ And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1Sam 30:8 David inquired of the  <c>Lord</c>, saying, <br>	Should I pursue this marauding band? <br>		Should I overtake them?’ <br> ¶ He answered him, <br>	‘Pursue, <br>		For you will surely overtake, <br>		You will surely rescue.’ <br> ¶ 
1Sam 30:9 So David went, together with the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those who were left behind remained. 
1Sam 30:10 But David pursued together with four hundred men, while two hundred remained behind, who were too faint to cross the Wadi Besor.  ¶ 
1Sam 30:11 They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him food to eat and water to drink, 
1Sam 30:12 and they gave him a piece of fig cake, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and nights. 
1Sam 30:13 David said to him, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you from?’ He said ‘I am an Egyptian lad, an Amalekite’s servant, and my master abandoned me because three days ago I fell sick. 
1Sam 30:14 We made a raid upon the South Country of the Cherethites and on that which belongs to Judah and upon the South Country of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned down.’ 
1Sam 30:15 And David said to him, ‘Will you bring me down to this band?’ He said, ‘Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.’  ¶ 
1Sam 30:16 When he had brought him down, there they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, on account of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
1Sam 30:17 And David struck them from twilight to the following evening in order to destroy them completely. None escaped except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled. 
1Sam 30:18 David recovered all the people whom the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives. 
1Sam 30:19 There was nothing missing, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken to themselves – David brought it all back. 
1Sam 30:20 He took all the flocks and the herds and drove those animals before the people, and they said, ‘This is David’s spoil.’  ¶ 
1Sam 30:21 Now when David came to the two hundred men, who had been too faint to follow him, so that he had to leave them behind at the Wadi Besor, they went out to meet David, and the people who were with him. When they came near to the people, he saluted them. 
1Sam 30:22 Then all the wicked and base scoundrels among the men who went with David began to say, ‘Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each, his wife and his children, that he may take them away and depart.’ 
1Sam 30:23 But David said, No! My brothers, you must not do this with that which the  <c>Lord</c> has given us – after he has preserved us and delivered the marauding band that came against us into our hand. 
1Sam 30:24 Who will give heed to you in this matter? For: <br>	As is the share of him who goes down into battle, <br>	So is the share of him who remains with the baggage. <br>	They must share alike.’ <br> ¶ 
1Sam 30:25 From that time on he made it a statute and precedent in Israel to this day.  ¶ 
1Sam 30:26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, ‘See! a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the  <c>Lord</c>, 
1Sam 30:27 to them who were in Bethel, in Ramoth in the South Country, in Jattir, 
1Sam 30:28 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa, 
1Sam 30:29 in Carmel, in the cities of Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites, 
1Sam 30:30 in Hormah, Bor-ashan, in Athach, 
1Sam 30:31 in Hebron, and to those in all the places where David and his men had stayed.  ¶ 
1Sam 31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1Sam 31:2 The Philistines followed close after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
1Sam 31:3 They pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers. 
1Sam 31:4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, ‘Draw your sword and run me through with it, lest these uncircumcised Philistines come and make sport of me.’ But his armourbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it. 
1Sam 31:5 When his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him. 
1Sam 31:6 So Saul and his three sons and his armourbearer died together on the same day. 
1Sam 31:7 When the Israelites who were in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they also left the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and occupied them.  ¶ 
1Sam 31:8 When on the following day the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1Sam 31:9 They cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to bring the good news to their idols and to the people. 
1Sam 31:10 They put his armour in the temple of Ashtarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Beth-shan. 
1Sam 31:11 When the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1Sam 31:12 all the valiant men arose and marched all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beths-han. They returned to Jabesh and burned them there. 
1Sam 31:13 They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.  ¶ 
Esth 1:1 These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia 
Esth 1:2 from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.  ¶ 
Esth 1:3 In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present 
Esth 1:4 while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.  ¶ 
Esth 1:5 When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace. 
Esth 1:6 There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone. 
Esth 1:7 Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality. 
Esth 1:8 The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased. 
Esth 1:9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.  ¶ 
Esth 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants 
Esth 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful. 
Esth 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.  ¶ 
Esth 1:13 The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law. 
Esth 1:14 Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. 
Esth 1:15 ‘Queen Vashit’, the king said, ‘has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?’  ¶ 
Esth 1:16 Memucan replied before the king and the officials, ‘Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces. 
Esth 1:17 The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, “King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!” 
Esth 1:18 This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife! 
Esth 1:19 If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she. 
Esth 1:20 When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honour to their husbands.’  ¶ 
Esth 1:21 The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised. 
Esth 1:22 He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!  ¶ 
Esth 2:1 Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her. 
Esth 2:2 Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, ‘Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king, 
Esth 2:3 and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful, 
Esth 2:4 and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.’ The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.  ¶ 
Esth 2:5 In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite. 
Esth 2:6 (Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon took captive.) 
Esth 2:7 Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.  ¶ 
Esth 2:8 When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women. 
Esth 2:9 The girl pleased him and gained his favour, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem. 
Esth 2:10 Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to. 
Esth 2:11 Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.  ¶ 
Esth 2:12 The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months, 
Esth 2:13 each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters, 
Esth 2:14 and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name. 
Esth 2:15 When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her. 
Esth 2:16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
Esth 2:17 And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favourite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
Esth 2:18 Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honour of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.  ¶ 
Esth 2:19 All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate. 
Esth 2:20 Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.  ¶ 
Esth 2:21 In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus. 
Esth 2:22 But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf. 
Esth 2:23 When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.  ¶ 
Esth 3:1 After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him. 
Esth 3:2 All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.  ¶ 
Esth 3:3 Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, ‘Why do you disobey the king’s command?’ 
Esth 3:4 When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
Esth 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious. 
Esth 3:6 But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.  ¶ 
Esth 3:7 In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had “pur” (which means “lot”) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.  ¶ 
Esth 3:8 So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ‘There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them. 
Esth 3:9 If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.’ 
Esth 3:10 So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
Esth 3:11 ‘The money is yours,’ the king said to Haman, ‘and the people also to do with them as you wish.’ 
Esth 3:12 And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring. 
Esth 3:13 Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions. 
Esth 3:14 A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day. 
Esth 3:15 By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.  ¶ Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.  ¶ 
Esth 4:1 When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation. 
Esth 4:2 He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth. 
Esth 4:3 In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.  ¶ 
Esth 4:4 When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behaviour, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them. 
Esth 4:5 So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.  ¶ 
Esth 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate. 
Esth 4:7 Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews. 
Esth 4:8 Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.  ¶ 
Esth 4:9 When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said, 
Esth 4:10 she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai, 
Esth 4:11 ‘All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.’  ¶ 
Esth 4:12 When Mordecai was told what Esther had said, 
Esth 4:13 he sent back this reply to Esther, ‘Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household. 
Esth 4:14 If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!’  ¶ 
Esth 4:15 Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai: 
Esth 4:16 ‘Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.’ 
Esth 4:17 Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.  ¶ 
Esth 5:1 On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. 
Esth 5:2 When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favour, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre. 
Esth 5:3 Then the king said to her, ‘What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.’  ¶ 
Esth 5:4 ‘If it seems best to the king,’ Esther said, ‘let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.’ 
Esth 5:5 Then the king ordered, ‘Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.’  ¶ So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
Esth 5:6 While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, ‘Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.’ 
Esth 5:7 Esther answered, 
Esth 5:8 ‘If I have won the king’s favour and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.’  ¶ 
Esth 5:9 Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai. 
Esth 5:10 Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife 
Esth 5:11 and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honoured him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers. 
Esth 5:12 ‘What is more,’ Haman said, ‘Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king. 
Esth 5:13 Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’  ¶ 
Esth 5:14 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, ‘Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.’ The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.  ¶ 
Esth 6:1 On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king. 
Esth 6:2 It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus. 
Esth 6:3 ‘What honour and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?’ the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied ‘Nothing has been done for him,’ 
Esth 6:4 the king said, ‘Who is in the court?’ Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
Esth 6:5 So the king’s pages said to him, ‘Haman is standing there, in the court.’ The king said, ‘Let him enter.’ 
Esth 6:6 So Haman entered, and the king said to him, ‘What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour?’ Haman said to himself, ‘Whom besides me could the king wish to honour?’ 
Esth 6:7 So he said to the king, ‘For the man whom the king wishes to honour 
Esth 6:8 let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed. 
Esth 6:9 Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honour and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.”’  ¶ 
Esth 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, ‘Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.’ 
Esth 6:11 So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.’  ¶ 
Esth 6:12 Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered. 
Esth 6:13 Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, ‘If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.’  ¶ 
Esth 6:14 While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.  ¶ 
Esth 7:1 So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther. 
Esth 7:2 As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, ‘Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.’ 
Esth 7:3 Then Queen Esther answered, ‘Your Majesty, if I have won your favour, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request, 
Esth 7:4 for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.’  ¶ 
Esth 7:5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, ‘Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?’  ¶ 
Esth 7:6 ‘A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.’ Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen. 
Esth 7:7 In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him. 
Esth 7:8 As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, ‘Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?’  ¶ As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman’s face 
Esth 7:9 and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, ‘There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!’ The king said ‘Hang him on them.’ 
Esth 7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified.  ¶ 
Esth 8:1 At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her. 
Esth 8:2 The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.  ¶ 
Esth 8:3 Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews. 
Esth 8:4 The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him. 
Esth 8:5 ‘If it seems best to the king,’ she said, ‘and if I have won his favour and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces. 
Esth 8:6 For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?’ 
Esth 8:7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, ‘See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews. 
Esth 8:8 Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.’  ¶ 
Esth 8:9 On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.  ¶ 
Esth 8:10 Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs. 
Esth 8:11 In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder 
Esth 8:12 throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar). 
Esth 8:13 A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves. 
Esth 8:14 So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands!  ¶ Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa; 
Esth 8:15 and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad. 
Esth 8:16 To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honour. 
Esth 8:17 And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.  ¶ 
Esth 9:1 Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them. 
Esth 9:2 The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples. 
Esth 9:3 All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
Esth 9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces. 
Esth 9:5 The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them. 
Esth 9:6 In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people. 
Esth 9:7 They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
Esth 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
Esth 9:9 Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
Esth 9:10 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.  ¶ 
Esth 9:11 On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king, 
Esth 9:12 and the king said to Queen Esther, ‘The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.’  ¶ 
Esth 9:13 ‘If it please the king,’ Esther said, ‘let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.’ 
Esth 9:14 And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows. 
Esth 9:15 The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder. 
Esth 9:16 And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder. 
Esth 9:17 This was on the thirteenth day of Adar. <br> ¶ On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 
Esth 9:18 (But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)  ¶ 
Esth 9:19 This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.  ¶ 
Esth 9:20 Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far. 
Esth 9:21 He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year, 
Esth 9:22 as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.  ¶ 
Esth 9:23 So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them. 
Esth 9:24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them. 
Esth 9:25 But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 
Esth 9:26 This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced, 
Esth 9:27 the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year, 
Esth 9:28 and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.  ¶ 
Esth 9:29 Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
Esth 9:30 He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security, 
Esth 9:31 to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation. 
Esth 9:32 And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records. <br> ¶ 
Esth 10:1 King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts. 
Esth 10:2 All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
Esth 10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.  ¶ 
Job 1:1 In the land of Uz there was a man called Job– a man blameless and upright, who feared God and 
Job 1:2 shunned evil. He had a family of seven sons and 
Job 1:3 three daughters: and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a vast train of servants, so that he was the richest man in all the 
Job 1:4 East. Now his sons used to hold feast day about, and they would send and invite their three sisters 
Job 1:5 to eat and drink with them; and when the cycle of feasts was over, Job used to send for them and prepare them for worship, rising early and offering burnt offerings for them all: for – said Job– <br>		Perchance my children have sinned <br>		And cursed God in their heart. And this Job never failed to do.  ¶ 
Job 1:6 Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings came to present themselves before Jehovah, and 
Job 1:7 among them came Satan. Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from, and Satan answered Jehovah thus, "From ranging the earth and from 
Job 1:8 walking up and down it." Then Jehovah said to Satan: <br>	"Hast thou noted my servant Job, <br>		That on earth there is none like him– <br>	A man blameless and upright, <br>		Who fears God and shuns evil?" <br>	
Job 1:9 To this Satan made answer: <br>	But is it for nothing that Job fears God? <br>	
Job 1:10 Hast Thou not Thyself fenced him and his house, <br>		And all he possesses on every side? <br>	The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, <br>		And his substance abounds in the land. <br>	
Job 1:11 But put forth Thy hand and touch all he possesses, <br>		And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." <br>	
Job 1:12 Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: <br>	"See! all he possesses is in thy power, <br>		But lay not thy hand on the man himself." <br>	Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah. 
Job 1:13 Now on a certain day, as his sons and daughters Were eating and drinking wine in the house of their 
Job 1:14 eldest brother, suddenly a messenger appeared before Job with the tidings: <br>	"The oxen were hard at the plough; <br>		And the asses were feeding beside them, <br>	
Job 1:15 When sabeans fell upon them and seized them; <br>		The servants they slew with the sword– <br>		Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br>	
Job 1:16 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br>		"The fire of God has fallen from heaven, <br>		And burnt to a cinder the sheep and the servants– <br>		Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br>	
Job 1:17 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br>	"Chaldeans, formed into three bands, <br>		Made a raid on the camels and seized them. <br>	The servants they slew with the sword– <br>		Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br>	
Job 1:18 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br>	"Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking <br>		In the house of their eldest brother: <br>	
Job 1:19 On a sudden a mighty wind <br>		From the other side of the desert <br>	came and smote and four sides of the house, <br>		That it fell on the young folk and killed them– <br>		Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br>	
Job 1:20 Then Job rose and rent his robe; and, after shaving <br>	his head, he threw himself with these words pros- <br>	trate upon the ground: <br>	
Job 1:21 "Naked came I from my mother’s womb, <br>		And naked thither must I return. <br>	Jehovah hath given, Jehovah hath taken: <br>		The name of Jehovah be blessed." <br>	
Job 1:22 In all this Job committed no sin, nor did he charge <br>	God with unseemly dealing.  ¶ 
Job 2:1 Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings came to present themselves before Jehovah, and among them came Satan to present himself before Jehovah. 
Job 2:2 Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from, and satan answered Jehovah thus, "From ranging the earth and from walking up and down it." 
Job 2:3 Then Jehovah said to Satan: <br>	"Hast thou noted my servant Job, <br>		That on earth there is none like him– <br>	A man blameless and upright, <br>		Who fears God and shuns evil? <br>	And still he clings to his honour– <br>		In vain hast thou set me on to destroy him." <br>	
Job 2:4 To this Satan made answer: <br>		"Skin for skin; <br>		All a man’s goods will he give for his life. <br>	
Job 2:5 But put forth Thy hand, touch his bone and his flesh <br>		And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." <br>	
Job 2:6 Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: <br>		"See! he is on thy power, <br>		But take heed that thou spare his life." <br>	
Job 2:7 Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah.  ¶ And he smote Job from the sole of his foot to the 
Job 2:8 crown of his head with boils so grievous that he took a potsherd to scratch with; and, as he was 
Job 2:9 sitting among the ashes, his wife said to him: <br>	"Art thou clinging still to thine honour? <br>		Curse God and die." <br>	
Job 2:10 But Job said to her: <br>		"Must thou too speak <br>		As a foolish women speak? <br>	We accept from God what is good: <br>		Shall we not accept what is evil?" <br>	In all this Job was guilty of no sin of speech.  ¶ 
Job 2:11 When Job’s three friends heard of all the misery that had come upon him, they travelled each man from his own place – Eliphaz the Temabite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made a tyrst together to come to condole with 
Job 2:12 him and comfort him. But when they caught a glimpse of him at a distance they did not recognize him. Then every man of them wept aloud and tore his robe and scattered dust heavenwards upon 
Job 2:13 his head. Then they sat down beside him upon the ground seven days and nights, and no one said a word to him; for they saw that his pain was very great.  ¶ 
Job 3:1 Thereafter Job opened his mouth to curse his 
Job 3:2 day, and thus he began: <br>	
Job 3:3 Perished the day wherein I was born, <br>		And the night which announced that a man-child had come. <br>
