{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 The Open English Bible

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The Open English Bible project aims to create a modern English translation of the Bible which is completely free of copyright restrictions and available without cost for any purpose.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The OEB is your Bible \uc1\u8212* you can use it in worship, print as many copies as you want (in whole or part), republish it on your own website, even remix it or take it as the base for your own translation to meet your needs and the needs of your community. And you can do this without needing our permission or paying us a cent (or penny, rupee or kobo).
\par}

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Base texts

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The normative text for the OEB New Testament is the Westcott & Hort critical text. Since the NA28 is subject to a claim of copyright, W&H remains the best available public domain text.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The normative text for the OEB Old Testament is the Codex Leningradensis (Leningrad Codex); specifically the electronic version of the Westminster Leningrad Codex. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The OEB is being created by taking existing English language translations which are in the public domain, and conforming them to modern English and suitable public domain Greek and Hebrew source texts.p The New Testament of the OEB is being formed on the base of the \uc1\u8216*Twentieth Century New Testament\uc1\u8217*, in particular the revised edition published in 1904. The Old Testament books which have been completed at this stage lean heavily on the work of John Edgar McFadyen and Charles Foster Kent, both of whom were very respected turn of the century Old Testament scholars.p The TCNT was one of the earliest 20th century attempts at a translation in clear modern language aimed at the ordinary reader and based on a modern textual base (ie Westcott & Hort). Predating the mid-20th century translations such as the New English Bible and even Moffatt\uc1\u8221*s groundbreaking attempt, it is out of copyright worldwide. The TCNT also has a particular resonance with the open source and free content communities of today - it was created by a loose collaboration of volunteers rather than a top-down hierarchy. Given the requirements of modern language and public domain status the TCNT was the best contender.
\par}

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Copyright

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
The OEB is available under a CC0 licence, effectively a waiver of copyright which allows the maximum reuse. We request (though this is not a licence condition) that altered versions be distributed under another name, or with changes clearly and comprehensively disclosed so that readers are not confused.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\cf1 1}In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}the earth was still unformed and chaotic,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
with darkness on the surface of the abyss,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and the spirit of God hovering over the waters.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}God said, \uc1\u8216*Let there be light,\uc1\u8217* and there was light.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}God saw that the light was good.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
He separated the light from the darkness,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}calling the light \uc1\u8217*day\uc1\u8217* and the darkness \uc1\u8217*night\uc1\u8217*.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
There was an evening and a morning, making the first day.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let there be a dome between the waters,

and let it separate the waters from the waters.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}So God made the dome to separate the waters below

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
from the waters which were above it.
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
It was so.

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}God called the dome the \uc1\u8217*sky\uc1\u8217*.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
There was an evening and a morning, making the second day.

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let the waters under the sky be gathered together,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and let the dry ground appear.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}God called the dry ground \uc1\u8217*land\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and he called the gathered waters \uc1\u8217*seas\uc1\u8217*.

God saw that it was good.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}God said, \uc1\u8216*Let the earth put forth vegetation:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Plants on the earth which yield their own kind of seed,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and trees that bear fruits in which are their own seed.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
It was so.

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The earth sprouted vegetation:

seed-bearing plants,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}There was an evening and a morning, making the third day.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let there be lights in the dome of the sky
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to separate the night from the day.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Let them be lights in the dome of the sky to light the earth.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
It was so.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}So God made the two great lights:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
The greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
God made the stars also. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}He placed all these lights in the dome of the sky
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to shed light upon the earth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}to rule over the day and over the night,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and to separate light from darkness.

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
God saw that it was good.

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let the waters teem with living creatures,

and let birds fly over the earth in the open dome of the sky.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}God created the great sea monsters,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
all kinds of living, moving creatures with which the waters teem,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and all kinds of winged birds.
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
God saw that it was good.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}He blessed them, saying, \uc1\u8216*Be fruitful,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
increase, fill the oceans,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and let the birds increase on the land.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}There was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let the earth produce all kinds of living creatures:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
cattle and reptiles and wild beasts.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
It was so.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground.
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
God saw that it was good.

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}Then God said, \uc1\u8216*Let us make humans who are images of us, who are like us.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Let them rule over the fish of the sea,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and all the reptiles that crawl upon the ground.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}So God created humans in his image,
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
he created them in the image of God.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
He created them male and female.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Then God blessed them, and said to them:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
\uc1\u8216*Be fruitful, grow in number,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
fill the earth and govern it;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and over every living thing that crawls on the ground,\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}God said, \uc1\u8216*I give you every seed-bearing plant
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
throughout all the earth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
They will be food for you,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}and to every wild beast and to every bird of the sky,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and to everything that crawls on the earth -
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
everything with the breath of life in it,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
I give every green plant for food.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\fi-1720\li2800
It was so.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}When God saw all that he had made,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he perceived that it was very good.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
There was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day.
\par}

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\cf1 2}So the heavens and the earth were finished, and everything in them.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}When on the seventh day God finished the work which he had done,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he rested that day from all his work.

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}God blessed the seventh day and set it apart,

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}This is the story of the heavens and earth when they were created.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
At the time when the {\scaps Lord} God made earth and heaven, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}there were not yet any plants on the earth, and no vegetation had sprung up; for the {\scaps Lord} God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the soil. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}A mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then the {\scaps Lord} God moulded a human being out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living being. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The {\scaps Lord} God planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and placed the human he had formed there. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}From the soil the {\scaps Lord} God made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food, with the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}A river flowed out of Eden and watered the garden, and from there branched into four. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The name of the first is Pishon, which flows round the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The gold of that land is pure and there is aromatic gum and the onyx stone. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows round the whole land of Cush, {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and the name of the third river is the Tigris, which heads toward the east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then the {\scaps Lord} God took the human and placed him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}The {\scaps Lord} God also gave the human this command: \uc1\u8216*You may freely eat from every tree of the garden, {\super\cf2\fs24 17}except from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you must not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then the {\scaps Lord} God said, \uc1\u8216*It is not good for the human to be alone; I will make a helper suited to him.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So out of the ground the {\scaps Lord} God formed all the wild beasts and birds, and made them come to the human to see what he would call them. Whatever he called each living creature, that was its name. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}So the human, Adam gave names to all cattle and all the wild birds and beasts. But there was no companion suitable for him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Then the {\scaps Lord} God caused the human to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}With the rib which he had taken from the human, the {\scaps Lord} built up a woman and brought her to the human. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Then the human said, \uc1\u8216*This now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, for from man she was taken.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 24}For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two become one flesh.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}The man and his wife were both naked, yet felt no shame. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}Now the snake was craftier than any other wild beast that the {\scaps {\super\cf2\fs24 1}Lord} God had made. It said to the woman, \uc1\u8216*Has God really said, \uc1\u8220*You must not eat from any tree of the garden\uc1\u8221*?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The woman answered, \uc1\u8216*We are allowed to eat the fruit of all the trees of the garden; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God has said, \uc1\u8220*You must not eat from it, nor should you touch it, for if you do, you will die.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then the snake said to the woman, \uc1\u8216*You will not die! {\super\cf2\fs24 5}God knows that on the day you eat some of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing what is good and what is evil.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, attractive to look at and desirable for acquiring wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they  that they were naked, so they sewed fig-leaves together to cover themselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But when they heard the sound of the {\scaps Lord} God walking in the garden in the evening breeze, the man and his wife hid from him among the garden trees.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}When the {\scaps Lord} God called to the man, \uc1\u8216*Where are you?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}he replied, \uc1\u8216*I heard you in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The {\scaps Lord} God said, \uc1\u8216*Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree from which I ordered you not to eat?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The man answered, \uc1\u8216*The woman you placed beside me, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}The {\scaps Lord} God said to the woman, \uc1\u8216*What is this that you have done?\uc1\u8217* The woman replied, \uc1\u8216*The snake deceived me, and I ate.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then the {\scaps Lord} God said to the snake:

\uc1\u8216*Because you have done this,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
you will be more accursed than all cattle

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then Laban said to Jacob, \uc1\u8216*Should you serve me for nothing simply because you are related to me?

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Jacob, however, took fresh rods of white poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white which was in the rods. {\super\cf2\fs24 38}He set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink (and they conceived when they came to drink) {\super\cf2\fs24 39}so that the flocks conceived before the rods.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}Jacob answered Laban, \uc1\u8216*I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}The one with whom you find your gods will be put to death; in the presence of our kinsmen investigate for yourself what is with me and take it.\uc1\u8217* Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban\uc1\u8217*s gods. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}So Laban went into Jacob\uc1\u8217*s tent and into Leah\uc1\u8217*s, and into the tent of the two slave-girls, but he did not find his gods.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}Then Jacob became angry and challenged Laban. \uc1\u8216*What is my crime?\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*What is my offense, that you have pursued hotly after me? {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Alhough you have gone through all through my things, what have you found of all your household possessions?

Therefore Joseph\uc1\u8217*s brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}When Joseph saw his brothers he knew them, but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, \uc1\u8216*Where do you come from?\uc1\u8217* They said, \uc1\u8216*From the land of Canaan to buy food.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So Joseph recognised his brothers, but they did not know him.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them and said to them, \uc1\u8216*You spies!

Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So he put them all into prison for three days.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then Joseph said to them on the third day, \uc1\u8216*Do this, and live, for I fear God: {\super\cf2\fs24 19}if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain in prison, but you go, carry grain to supply the needs of your households {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and bring your youngest brother to me.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}They did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, \uc1\u8216*We are indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw his distress and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen; therefore this trouble has come upon us.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Reuben added, \uc1\u8216*Did I not say to you, \uc1\u8220*Do not sin against the boy,\uc1\u8221* but you would not listen? Therefore now his very blood is required.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}They did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had spoken to them through an interpreter. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}But he turned away from them and wept; then he turned back and spoke to them, and, taking Simeon from among them, bound him before their eyes. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Then Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with grain and to restore each man\uc1\u8217*s money to his sack and to give them provision for the journey; and it was done to them.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then Judah said to Israel his father, \uc1\u8216*Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that both we and you and our little ones may live and not die. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}I will be surety for him, you can hold me responsible for him.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}When Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they had brought and bowed down low before him. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}He asked them regarding their welfare and said, \uc1\u8216*Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke?

 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, so that he might show him the way to Goshen. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}When they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father, and when he presented himself to him Jacob fell on his neck and wept there a long time.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 47}Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, \uc1\u8216*My father and my brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Pharaoh said to them, \uc1\u8216*What is your occupation?\uc1\u8217* And they said to Pharaoh, \uc1\u8216*We are shepherds, both we and our fathers.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}They also said to Pharaoh, \uc1\u8216*We have come to live in the land, because there is no pasture for our flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. We beg of you, to let us stay in the province of Goshen.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \uc1\u8216*Since your father and your brothers have come to you, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}the land of Egypt is at your disposal. Settle them in the best part of it. Let them stay in the province of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Joseph also brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, \uc1\u8216*How many years have you lived?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Jacob answered, \uc1\u8216*I have lived a hundred and thirty years; few and hard have been the years of my life, and they have not been as many as those that my ancestors lived on earth.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}After Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh\uc1\u8217*s presence. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So Joseph gave his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, near Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Joseph also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his father\uc1\u8217*s household according to the number of their little children.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}There was no bread in all the land; since the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Joseph gathered in all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\uc1\u8217*s house.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, \uc1\u8216*Give us bread: for why should we die before your eyes because our money fails?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then Joseph said, \uc1\u8216*Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money has failed.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So they brought their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their cattle.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, \uc1\u8216*We will not hide from you, my lord, now that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are yours; there is nothing left in the your sight, but our bodies and our lands. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land?

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh\uc1\u8217*s. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}As for the people, he reduced them to slavery from one end of Egypt to the other. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had a definite allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Hence they did not sell their land.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Then Joseph said to the people, \uc1\u8216*I have bought you and you land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}At the ingatherings, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed for the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 25}They replied, \uc1\u8216*You have saved our lives; let us find favour in your sight, lord, and we will be Pharaoh\uc1\u8217*s slaves.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 26}So Joseph made it a law, still in force today, that Pharaoh should have a fifth; only the land of the priests did not come into the possession of Pharaoh.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}The Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired possessions in it and had many children and became exceedingly numerous. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Jacob lived for seventeen years in Egypt and died at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.

So Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Israel said to Joseph, \uc1\u8216*I had not thought to see your face; and now God has let me see your offspring as well.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Joseph took them from his father\uc1\u8217*s lap, and bowed with his face to the earth.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them and blessed them; each accordingto his blessing he blessed them. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}He instructed them, \uc1\u8216*I am to be gathered to my people.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Jacob; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and forty days were devoted to it, for this is the full period for embalming. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The Egyptians also mourned for him seventy days.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the members of Pharaoh\uc1\u8217*s court, saying, \uc1\u8216*If now you wish to do me a favour, speak to Pharaoh and say, Joseph\uc1\u8217*s father made him take an oath, saying, \uc1\u8220*See, I am dying; bury me in my grave which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.\uc1\u8221* Ask Pharaoh, \uc1\u8220*Let me go up, I beg of you, and bury my father; after that I will return.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Pharaoh said, \uc1\u8216*Go up and bury your father, as he made you take an oath.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, all the elders of the land of Egypt, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father\uc1\u8217*s household.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, they held there a great and impressive lamentation; and Joseph appointed a period of mourning for his father which lasted seven days. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}When the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, \uc1\u8216*This is an impressive mourning among the Egyptians.\uc1\u8217* That is why that place across the Jordan is called, Ebel-Mizraim{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn  Mourning of the Egyptians }.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Then Jacob\uc1\u8217*s sons did for him what he had commanded them: {\super\cf2\fs24 13}they carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to hold as a place of burial. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}After he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father returned to Egypt.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
  {\cf1 1}Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8217*Moses my servant is dead; now arise, go over this Jordan with all this people to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Every place upon which the sole of thy foot shall tread, to thee will I give it, as I promised Moses. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting sun shall be your boundary. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}No one shall be able to stand against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt bring this people into possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Only be very courageous and strong, to observe faithfully all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have success wherever thou goest. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}This law-book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest observe faithfully all that is written in it; for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and shalt have success. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Have I not commanded thee? Be courageous and strong! Fear not, neither be dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou goest.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, \uc1\u8217*Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as a possession.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Also to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Remember the command which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, when he said, \uc1\u8217*Jehovah your God is about to bring you to a settled abode and will give you this land.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Your wives and your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you; but you \uc1\u8211* as many of you as are able to fight \uc1\u8211* shall pass over armed before your kinsmen and shall help them, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}until Jehovah hath given a settled abode to your kinsmen as to you and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is about to give them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the rising sun. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And they answered Joshua saying. All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Any one who shall rebel against your command and shall not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be courageous and strong.  {\cf1 2}Then Joshua the son of Nun sent secretly from Shittim two men as spies, saying. Go view the land and especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Now it was told the king of Jericho, saying, There came some men here tonight from the Israelites to explore the land. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying. Bring forth the men who have come to you, for they have come to explore all the land. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said. It is true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}When the time came to shut the gate at nightfall. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Accordingly the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan opposite the fords, and as soon as they that pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and said to the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that terror because of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are losing heart before you. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And as soon as we had heard it, we lost heart completely, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah yonr God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth beneath. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you will also deal kindly with my father\uc1\u8217*s house, and give me a true token. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But Rahab said to the men. Swear that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And the men said to her, We will be prepared to forfeit our lives for you, if you do not disclose this business of ours. It shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then she let them down by a rope through the window (for her house was so close beside the city wall that she dwelt upon the wall). {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And she said to them. Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers happen to find you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go on your way. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then the men said to her. We will be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down and you shall gather to yourself into the house, your father and your mother and your brothers, and all your father\uc1\u8217*s household. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}And it shall be, if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if any one stays with you in the house, his blood shall be on our heads, if an injury befalls him. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But if you do disclose this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath to which you have made us swear. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}And she said. Let it be as you say. So she sent them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet cord in the window. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So they went and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned. Now the pursuers sought for them in every direction, but did not find them. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Then the two men returned, descending from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}And they said to Joshua, Jehovah hath delivered all the land into our power; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land have lost heart before us.  {\cf1 3}Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and he and all the Israelites came t the Jodan and spent the night there before they moved over. Then they removed from Shittim. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Now after three days the officers went through the midst of the camp {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God and the priest, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have never passed this way before. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then Jehovah said to Joshus, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that I will be with thee as I was with Moses, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, you shall stand still in the waters of Jordan. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Joshua also said to the Israelites, Come hither and hear the words of Jehovah your God. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then Joshua said, By this you shall know that a living God is among you, and that he will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites and the Jebusites. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Also take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}And it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, and they shall rise in a heap. And the waters that come down from above shall stand still. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant being before the people, that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And so when those who were crossing carrying the ark came to the Jordan \uc1\u8211* the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest \uc1\u8211* therefore when the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}the waters which came down from above stood still. Its waters rose up in a heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people stood opposite Jericho. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan.  {\cf1 4}And it came to pass, when the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan, that Jehovah said to Joshua, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Command them saying, Take hence from the midst of the Jordan, (out of the place where the priests\uc1\u8217* feet stood) twelve stones, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the camping-place, where you shall pass the night, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed of the Israelites, a man from each tribe, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and let every man of you lift a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do you mean by these stones?" {\super\cf2\fs24 7}then you shall say to them, "Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off." and these stones shall be for a memorial to the Israelites forever. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The priests who carried the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. Then the people passed over quickly. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And it came to pass when all the people had finished the passage, that the ark of Jehovah passed over and the priests, in the presence of the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses commanded them; {\super\cf2\fs24 13}about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And Jehovah said to Joshua, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Command the priests who carry the ark of the law, that they come up out of the Jordan. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}And when the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests\uc1\u8217* feet were lifted up on the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.  {\cf1 5 }Now when all the kings of the Amorites, who were to the west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the Israelites, until they were passed over, they lost heart, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the Israelites. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make knives of flint, and circumcise again the Israelites the second time. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then Joshua made him knives of flint and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeah Araloth (The hill of the foreskins). {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised the Israelites: all the people that came out of Egypt who were males, even all the men capable of fighting, died in the wilderness in the way, on the journey from Egypt. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness in the way on the journey from Egypt, had not been circumcised. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}For the Israelites wandered forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men capable of fighting, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not heed the mice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land concerning which, Jehovah gave oath to their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey.  {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But their children, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the journey.  {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were well again. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}And Jehovah said to Joshua, To-day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. So the name of that place has been called Gilgal (Rolling), to this day. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}When now the Israelites encamped in Gilgal, they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the mouth in the evening in the plains of Jericho. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, on the very same day. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And ,Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?  {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And he said, Nay, but as Prince of the host of Jehovah have I now come. Then Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What has my lord to say to his servant?  {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And the Prince of Jehovah\uc1\u8217*s host said to Joshua, Take off thy sandals from thy feet; for the place on which thou art standing is holy.  {\cf1 6}Now Jericho had closed its gates and was closed on account of the Israelites; no one went out or in. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams\uc1\u8217* horns before the ark; and ye shall march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets.  {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Then Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy power Jericho, and its king, with the men capable of fighting.  {\super\cf2\fs24 3}And ye shall march around the city, all the warriors going about the city once. Thus shall ye do six days.  {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram\uc1\u8217*s horn, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down of itself. And the seventh day the people shall go up every man straight before him.  {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams\uc1\u8217* horns before Jehovah,  {\super\cf2\fs24 7}therefore Joshua said to the people, March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah,  {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams\uc1\u8217* horns before, Jehovah shall pass on, while they blow the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following them,  {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and the armed men going before the priests who blow the trumpets, and the great multitude following the ark, while they continually blow the trumpets.  {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Joshua also commanded the people saying, You shall not shout the battle-cry, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word go out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, \uc1\u8217*Shout the battle-cry;\uc1\u8217* then you shall shout.  {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So he caused the ark of Jehovah to march around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.  {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And Joshua rose early in the morning, so the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.  {\super\cf2\fs24 13}And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams\uc1\u8217* horns before the ark of Jehovah kept going while they blew the trumpets, the armed men going before them and the rearguard following the ark of Jehovah, blowing trumpets  {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.  {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and when they had made the circuit of the city after the same manner, seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.  {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And it came to pass at the seventh time, that the priests blew the trumpets; Joshua said to the people, Shout the battle-cry; for Jehovah bath given you the city.  {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And the city shall be completely devoted to Jehovah, together with all that is in it; only Rahab the harlot shall live, both she and those who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.  {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Only keep yourselves from that which has been placed under the ban, lest when you have placed it under the ban you take of it, and so bring the camp of Israel under the ban, and trouble it.  {\super\cf2\fs24 19}But all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron are holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.  {\super\cf2\fs24 20}So the people shouted the battle-cry, and went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. And when they blew the trumpets, it came to pass, as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down of itself .  {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Then they completely destroyed by the sword all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass.  {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot\uc1\u8217*s house, and bring out from there the woman all that she has, as you took oath to her.  {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So the young men, the spies. went in and brought Rahab with her father and mother and kinsmen and all that she had. Even all the members of her family they brought out; and they put them in a place of security outside of the camp of Israel.  {\super\cf2\fs24 24}But they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.  {\super\cf2\fs24 25}But Rahab the harlot and her father\uc1\u8217*s household and all that she had, Joshua saved; and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel even until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.  {\super\cf2\fs24 26}At that time Joshua made them subscribe to this oath: Cursed be that man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city: With the loss of his first-born shall he lay its foundation, And with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.  {\super\cf2\fs24 27}So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.   {\cf1 7}But the Israelites broke faith in that which had been placed under the ban; for Achan, the son of Carmi. the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which had been placed under the ban; therefore the anger of Jehovah was aroused against the Israelites. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is on the east side of  Bethel, and commanded them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went and spied out Ai.  {\super\cf2\fs24 3}And when they returned to Joshua, they said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people toil up there; for they are few. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; but they fled before the men of Ai.  {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And the men of Ai smote of them, about thirty-six men. and pursued them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the people lost heart to resist and became as weak as water.  {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before Jehovah until the evening, together with the elders of Israel; and they put  dust upon their heads.  {\super\cf2\fs24 7}And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to bring ns to ruin! would that we had been contented and stayed beyond the Jordan!  {\super\cf2\fs24 8}O Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel bas turned his back before his enemies!  {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name? {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Arise! why art thou lying prostrate thus? {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them, indeed they have actually taken that which was placed under the ban, and have also been guilty of theft and deception; and they have even put it among their own things.  {\super\cf2\fs24 12}That is \uc1\u183*why the Israelites cannot stand before their enemies, because they have fa11en under the ban. I will not be with you any more, unless ye destroy from among you that which was placed under the ban.  {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Arise, sanctify the people, and say, \uc1\u8217*Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, "There is in the midst of thee, O Israel, that which was placed under the ban; thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away from among you that which was placed under the ban." {\super\cf2\fs24 14}In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes; and it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take, shall come near man by man. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And it shall be that he who is taken that which was placed under the ban shall he burnt with fire, together with all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because be has committed a shameful crime in Israel.\uc1\u8217* So ,Joshua \uc1\u8217*rose up early in the morning. and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites, and he brought near the family of the Zerahites, man by man; and Zabdi was taken.  {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then he brought near his household, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zcrah, of the tribe of Judah was taken.  {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Then Joshua said to Achan, my son, give, now, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and render praise to him; and tell now what you have done: do not conceal it from me.  {\super\cf2\fs24 20}And Achan answered Joshua and said, Truly, I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:  {\super\cf2\fs24 21}when I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver. and a bar of gold of fifty shekels weight, I coveted them and took them, and now they are hidden in the earth in the middle of my tent with the money underneath. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent. and there it was hidden in his tent with the money underneath.  {\super\cf2\fs24 23}And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and all the Israelites and laid  them down before Jehovah. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Then .Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan  the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep, and his tent and all that he had and brought them to the valley of Achor.  {\super\cf2\fs24 25}And Joshua said, Why have you brought trouble upon us? Jehovah shall bring trouble upon you today. So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones,  {\super\cf2\fs24 26}and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Hence the name of the place has been called the valley of Achor (Trouble) to this day.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}His name was Elimelech and his wife\uc1\u8217*s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the {\scaps Lord} had remembered his people and given them food. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, \uc1\u8216*Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the {\scaps Lord} be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The {\scaps Lord} grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and said to her, \uc1\u8216*No, we will return with you to your people.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}But Naomi said, \uc1\u8216*Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands? {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, \uc1\u8220*I have hope,\uc1\u8221* even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the {\scaps Lord} has sent me adversity.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8216*Look,\uc1\u8217* said Naomi, \uc1\u8216*your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 16}But Ruth answered, \uc1\u8216*Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the {\scaps Lord} bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, \uc1\u8216*Can this be Naomi?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}\uc1\u8216*Do not call me Naomi,\uc1\u8217* she said to them, \uc1\u8216*call me Mara{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   In Hebrew \uc1\u8216*Naomi\uc1\u8217* means \uc1\u8216*pleasant,\uc1\u8217* and \uc1\u8216*Mara\uc1\u8217* means \uc1\u8216*bitter.\uc1\u8217* }, for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}I had plenty when I left, but the {\scaps Lord} has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the {\scaps Lord} has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 In the Fields of Boaz

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 2}Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, \uc1\u8216*Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Go, my daughter,\uc1\u8217* she replied.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, \uc1\u8216*The {\scaps Lord} be with you,\uc1\u8217* they answered him, \uc1\u8216*May the {\scaps Lord} bless you.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*Whose girl is this?\uc1\u8217* Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, \uc1\u8216*It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then Boaz said to Ruth, \uc1\u8216*Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then she bowed low and said to him, \uc1\u8216*Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Boaz replied, \uc1\u8216*I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}May the {\scaps Lord} repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then she said, \uc1\u8216*I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, \uc1\u8216*Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.\uc1\u8217* So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: \uc1\u8216*Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}\uc1\u8216*Where did you glean today, and where did you work?\uc1\u8217* asked her mother-in-law. \uc1\u8216*A blessing on him who took notice of you!\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. \uc1\u8216*The name of the man with whom I worked today,\uc1\u8217* she said, \uc1\u8216*is Boaz.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \uc1\u8216*May the blessing of the {\scaps Lord} rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,\uc1\u8217* she added, \uc1\u8216*is a near relation of ours.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}\uc1\u8216*He told me,\uc1\u8217* Ruth said, \uc1\u8216*that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Naomi said to Ruth, \uc1\u8216*It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}One day, Naomi said to Ruth, \uc1\u8216*My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous? {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours? {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*I will do as you say.\uc1\u8217* Ruth said to her.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet! {\super\cf2\fs24 9}\uc1\u8216*Who are you?\uc1\u8217* he said. \uc1\u8216*I am Ruth your servant,\uc1\u8217* she answered, \uc1\u8216*Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}He said, \uc1\u8216*May you be blest by the {\scaps Lord}, my daughter. You have shown me greater favour now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the {\scaps Lord} lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognise her, for Boaz said, \uc1\u8216*No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}He also said, \uc1\u8216*Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.\uc1\u8217* So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, \uc1\u8216*Is it you, my daughter?\uc1\u8217* Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}\uc1\u8216*He gave me these six measures of barley,\uc1\u8217* she said, \uc1\u8216*for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So when the near relative said to Boaz, \uc1\u8216*Buy it for yourself,\uc1\u8217* Boaz drew off the man\uc1\u8217*s sandal.

 {\cf1 1}Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the {\scaps Lord} of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the {\scaps Lord} there. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}but to Hannah he used to give a double portion because he loved her. But the {\scaps Lord} had shut up her womb. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the {\scaps Lord} had shut up her womb. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}This happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the {\scaps Lord}, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But Elkanah her husband said to her, \uc1\u8216*Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh, and stood before the {\scaps Lord}. Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the {\scaps Lord} and wept bitterly. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}She vowed a vow, saying,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}While she continued praying before the {\scaps Lord}, Eli observed her mouth. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So Eli said to her, \uc1\u8216*How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8216*No, my lord,\uc1\u8217* Hannah answered, \uc1\u8216*I am an unfortunate woman! I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my heart before the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then Eli answered, \uc1\u8216*Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}She said, \uc1\u8216*Let your maid-servant find favour in your sight.\uc1\u8217* So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the {\scaps Lord}, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the {\scaps Lord} remembered her.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and named him Samuel{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   Heb: Asked of God }, saying, \uc1\u8216*For I have asked him of the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the {\scaps Lord} the yearly sacrifice and his vow. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, \uc1\u8216*When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he will appear in the presence of the {\scaps Lord} and will live there forever.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Elkanah her husband said to her, \uc1\u8216*Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the {\scaps Lord} establish your word.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the {\scaps Lord} in Shiloh. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}She said, \uc1\u8216*Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the {\scaps Lord} has granted me my petition which I asked of him. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Now, I on my part have given him to the {\scaps Lord}; as long as he lives he is given to the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8217* So she left him there before the {\scaps Lord}.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the {\scaps Lord} in the presence of Eli the priest. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the {\scaps Lord}, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest\uc1\u8217*s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the {\scaps Lord} in Shiloh. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest\uc1\u8217*s servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, \uc1\u8216*Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Should the man, however, say to him, \uc1\u8216*First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,\uc1\u8217* he would reply, \uc1\u8216*No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}The sin of the young men was very great before the {\scaps Lord}, for the men had contempt for the offering of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}And Samuel continued ministering before the {\scaps Lord} \uc1\u8211* a lad girded with a linen ephod. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, \uc1\u8216*The {\scaps Lord} repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8217* Then they would return to their own home. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}And the {\scaps Lord} visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters.

So Saul ate with Samuel that day. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down for the night. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}At daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \uc1\u8216*Get up, so that I can send you on your way.\uc1\u8217* So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}But they struck at the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint, {\super\cf2\fs24 32}and they rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}When Saul was told that the people were sinning against the {\scaps Lord} in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, \uc1\u8216*Treason!

The weapons of the young men were consecrated even on an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their weapons be holy!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presense, that was taken from before the {\scaps Lord} in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}(Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the {\scaps Lord}.

 {\cf1 23}David was told that Philistines were fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}David inquired of the {\scaps Lord}, \uc1\u8216*Should I go and attack these Philistines?\uc1\u8217* And the {\scaps Lord} said to David, \uc1\u8216*Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 3}But David\uc1\u8217*s men said to him, \uc1\u8216*Behold we are afraid here in Judah.

 {\cf1 24}When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, \uc1\u8216*David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}So Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats\uc1\u8217* Crags. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, \uc1\u8216*Is this not your voice, my son David?\uc1\u8217* Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}He said to David, \uc1\u8216*You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}You have done great good to me in that today, when the {\scaps Lord} had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound?

 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 39}Now when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \uc1\u8216*Blessed be the {\scaps Lord} who has avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil. The evil-doing of Nabal the {\scaps Lord} brought back upon his own head.\uc1\u8217* Then David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. {\super\cf2\fs24 44}But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David\uc1\u8217*s wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim.

But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come there after him, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}so he arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720

Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Abishai said to David, \uc1\u8216*God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to strike him twice!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}But David said to Abishai, \uc1\u8216*Do not destroy him, for who can lay his hand upon the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s anointed and be innocent?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}David said, \uc1\u8216*As the {\scaps Lord} lives, either the {\scaps Lord} will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and be destroyed. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The {\scaps Lord} forbid that I should lift my hand against the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s anointed, but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul\uc1\u8217*s head and they departed.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And David cried to the army and to Abner, the son of Ner, \uc1\u8216*Do you make no answer Abner?\uc1\u8217* Then Abner answered, \uc1\u8216*Who are you that calls to the king?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And David said to Abner, \uc1\u8216*Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}This that you have done is not good. As the {\scaps Lord} lives, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s anointed. Now see where the king\uc1\u8217*s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then Saul recognised David\uc1\u8217*s voice and said, \uc1\u8216*Is this your voice, my son David?\uc1\u8217* And David said, \uc1\u8216*It is my voice, my lord the king.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}He said, \uc1\u8216*Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty? {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the {\scaps Lord} has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it was men, cursed be they before the {\scaps Lord}, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the {\scaps Lord}, saying, \uc1\u8220*Go serve other gods.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away from the presence of the {\scaps Lord}, for the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Then Saul said, \uc1\u8216*I have done wrong. Return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And David answered, \uc1\u8216*There is the king\uc1\u8217*s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}And the {\scaps Lord} will reward each man\uc1\u8217*s righteousness and fidelity, for the {\scaps Lord} delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*a anointed. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Then Saul said to David, \uc1\u8216*Be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and will surely succeed!\uc1\u8217* So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place.

 {\cf1 27}Then David said to himself, \uc1\u8216*I will be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}So David set out, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}David stayed with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal\uc1\u8217*s widow. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these tribes live in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}As often as David struck the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}When Achish said, \uc1\u8216*Where have you made a raid today?\uc1\u8217* David answered, \uc1\u8216*Against the Negreb of Judah\uc1\u8217*, or \uc1\u8216*against the Negreb of the Jerahmeelites\uc1\u8217*, or \uc1\u8216*against the Negreb of the Kenites.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, \uc1\u8216*They might give information against us and say, \uc1\u8220*David has done this, or that.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217* Such was his custom all the while he lived in the open country of the Philistines. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And Achish trusted David, thinking, \uc1\u8216*He has brought himself into ill odour with his people Israel, therefore he will be my servant forever.\uc1\u8217*

 {\cf1 1}These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia {\super\cf2\fs24 2}from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present {\super\cf2\fs24 4}while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days\uc1\u8217* feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Drink was brought in vessels of gold \uc1\u8211* which were all different \uc1\u8211* and the king\uc1\u8217*s wine was provided with royal liberality. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus\uc1\u8217* royal palace.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants {\super\cf2\fs24 11}to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8216*Queen Vashit\uc1\u8217*, the king said, \uc1\u8216*has failed to obey my royal command \uc1\u8211* the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs!

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Memucan replied before the king and the officials, \uc1\u8216*Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, \uc1\u8220*King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king\uc1\u8217*s officials, and there will be contempt and strife! {\super\cf2\fs24 19}If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}When the king\uc1\u8217*s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom \uc1\u8211* great as it is \uc1\u8211* the wives of all classes will give honour to their husbands.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 2}Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Then the king\uc1\u8217*s servants who waited upon him said, \uc1\u8216*Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women\uc1\u8217*s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.\uc1\u8217* The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}(Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon took captive.) {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle\uc1\u8217*s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}When the king\uc1\u8217*s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king\uc1\u8217*s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The girl pleased him and gained his favour, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king\uc1\u8217*s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther\uc1\u8217*s health and what was happening to her.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women\uc1\u8217*s quarters, {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favourite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honour of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king\uc1\u8217*s gate. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Hatred without Pity

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king\uc1\u8217*s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai\uc1\u8217*s behalf. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}All the king\uc1\u8217*s courtiers who were in the king\uc1\u8217*s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then the king\uc1\u8217*s courtiers, who were in the king\uc1\u8217*s gate, said to Mordecai, \uc1\u8216*Why do you disobey the king\uc1\u8217*s command?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai\uc1\u8217*s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai\uc1\u8217*s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had \uc1\u8220*pur\uc1\u8221* (which means \uc1\u8220*lot\uc1\u8221*) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month \uc1\u8211* the month of Adar.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, \uc1\u8216*There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king\uc1\u8217*s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}\uc1\u8216*The money is yours,\uc1\u8217* the king said to Haman, \uc1\u8216*and the people also to do with them as you wish.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king\uc1\u8217*s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king\uc1\u8217*s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province \uc1\u8211* publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 4}When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He went as far as the king\uc1\u8217*s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}In every province, wherever the king\uc1\u8217*s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}When Esther\uc1\u8217*s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai\uc1\u8217*s behaviour, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So Esther called Hathach, one of the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king\uc1\u8217*s gate. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king\uc1\u8217*s treasury for the destruction of the Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}\uc1\u8216*All the king\uc1\u8217*s courtiers and the people of the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}When Mordecai was told what Esther had said, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}he sent back this reply to Esther, \uc1\u8216*Don\uc1\u8217*t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king\uc1\u8217*s household. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai: {\super\cf2\fs24 16}\uc1\u8216*Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don\uc1\u8217*t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Mordecai did everything Esther had directed. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 5}On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king\uc1\u8217*s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favour, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then the king said to her, \uc1\u8216*What is it, Queen Esther?

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}\uc1\u8216*If it seems best to the king,\uc1\u8217* Esther said, \uc1\u8216*let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Then the king ordered, \uc1\u8216*Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther\uc1\u8217*s wish may be gratified.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, \uc1\u8216*Whatever your petition is, it will be granted.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king\uc1\u8217*s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home.

 {\cf1 6}On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king\uc1\u8217*s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8216*What honour and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?\uc1\u8217* the king asked. When the king\uc1\u8217*s pages who waited on him replied \uc1\u8216*Nothing has been done for him,\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}the king said, \uc1\u8216*Who is in the court?\uc1\u8217* Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king\uc1\u8217*s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So the king\uc1\u8217*s pages said to him, \uc1\u8216*Haman is standing there, in the court.\uc1\u8217* The king said, \uc1\u8216*Let him enter.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So Haman entered, and the king said to him, \uc1\u8216*What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour?\uc1\u8217* Haman said to himself, \uc1\u8216*Whom besides me could the king wish to honour?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}So he said to the king, \uc1\u8216*For the man whom the king wishes to honour {\super\cf2\fs24 8}let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king\uc1\u8217*s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honour and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, \uc1\u8220*This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then the king said to Haman, \uc1\u8216*Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king\uc1\u8217*s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, \uc1\u8216*This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Mordecai returned to the king\uc1\u8217*s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, \uc1\u8216*If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}While they were still talking with him, the king\uc1\u8217*s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 7}So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, \uc1\u8216*Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then Queen Esther answered, \uc1\u8216*Your Majesty, if I have won your favour, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated!

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, \uc1\u8216*Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}\uc1\u8216*A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.\uc1\u8217* Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther\uc1\u8217*s couch. The king cried, \uc1\u8216*Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman\uc1\u8217*s face {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, \uc1\u8216*There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!\uc1\u8217* The king said \uc1\u8216*Hang him on them.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 8}At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews\uc1\u8217* enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king\uc1\u8217*s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman\uc1\u8217*s property.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*If it seems best to the king,\uc1\u8217* she said, \uc1\u8216*and if I have won his favour and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, \uc1\u8216*See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king\uc1\u8217*s name and seal it with the king\uc1\u8217*s signet ring.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king\uc1\u8217*s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king\uc1\u8217*s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder {\super\cf2\fs24 12}throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar). {\super\cf2\fs24 13}A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province \uc1\u8211* publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king\uc1\u8217*s commands!
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honour. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And in every province and city, wherever the king\uc1\u8217*s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 9}Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king\uc1\u8217*s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king\uc1\u8217*s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For Mordecai was great in the king\uc1\u8217*s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews\uc1\u8217* enemy; but they did not take any plunder.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and the king said to Queen Esther, \uc1\u8216*The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720

Let the bodies of Haman\uc1\u8217*s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman\uc1\u8217*s ten sons on the gallows. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And the other Jews who were in the king\uc1\u8217*s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}This was on the thirteenth day of Adar.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}(But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day \uc1\u8211* and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year, {\super\cf2\fs24 22}as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast \uc1\u8220*Pur\uc1\u8221*, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced, {\super\cf2\fs24 27}the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.

 {\cf1 2}Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings came{\super\cf2\fs24 1}to present themselves before Jehovah, and amongthem came Satan to present himself before Jehovah. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from,and satan answered Jehovah thus, "From rangingthe earth and from walking up and down it." {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then Jehovah said to Satan:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
"Hast thou noted my servant Job,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
That on earth there is none like him\uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
A man blameless and upright,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Who fears God and shuns evil?
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And still he clings to his honour\uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
In vain hast thou set me on to destroy him."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}To this Satan made answer:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"Skin for skin;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
All a man\uc1\u8217*s goods will he give for his life.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}But put forth Thy hand, touch his bone and his flesh
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Whereat Jehovah said to Satan:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"See! he is on thy power,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
But take heed that thou spare his life."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs48 The Second Test

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
And he smote Job from the sole of his foot to the {\super\cf2\fs24 8}crown of his head with boils so grievous that hetook a potsherd to scratch with; and, as he was {\super\cf2\fs24 9}sitting among the ashes, his wife said to him:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
"Art thou clinging still to thine honour?
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Curse God and die."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}But Job said to her:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"Must thou too speak
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
As a foolish women speak?
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
We accept from God what is good:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Shall we not accept what is evil?"
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
In all this Job was guilty of no sin of speech.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}When Job\uc1\u8217*s three friends heard of all the miserythat had come upon him, they travelled each manfrom his own place \uc1\u8211* Eliphaz the Temabite, Bildadthe Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for theyhad made a tyrst together to come to condole with {\super\cf2\fs24 12}him and comfort him. But when they caught aglimpse of him at a distance they did not recognizehim. Then every man of them wept aloud andtore his robe and scattered dust heavenwards upon {\super\cf2\fs24 13}his head. Then they sat down beside him upon theground seven days and nights, and no one said a wordto him; for they saw that his pain was very great. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}Thereafter Job opened his mouth to curse his {\super\cf2\fs24 2}day, and thus he began:

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Perished the day wherein I was born,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And the night which announced that a man-child had come.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4a}Utter darkness let that night be,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9b}Looking for light, but finding none.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4b}May God in the heights above ask not after it,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4c}And may no beam shine forth upon it.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}May darkness and gloom claim it for their own,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And may the thick cloud rest upon it.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Black vapours of the day affright it!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And let the thick darkness snatch it away.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
May it not be joined to the days of the year,

Or enter into the tale of the months.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}As for that night, let it be barren:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
May there never ring through it a cry of joy.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Accursed of sorcerers be that day\uc1\u8211*

Of those that are skilful to stir up Leviathan.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 9c}And never the eyelids of Dawn may it see;

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Since it shut not the doors of my mother\uc1\u8217*s womb,

And hid not trouble from mine eyes.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800

Breathe my last as I came from the womb,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Like a hidden untimely birth,

Like infants that never see light?

And why were there breasts to suck?

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}For then had I lain down in quiet,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Then had I slept and had rest\uc1\u8211*

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}With kings of the earth and with cousellors,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Or with princes rich in gold,

Who had filled their houses with silver.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}There the wicked cease their tumult,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
There the weary are at rest\uc1\u8211*

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Prisoners at ease together,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Deaf to the taskmaster\uc1\u8217*s voice.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}There the small and the great are alike,

And the servants is free from his master.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Why is light given to the wretched,

And life to the bitter in soul,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Such as long for death, but it comes not,

And dig for it more than for treasure,

 {\cf1 4}Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: {\super\cf2\fs24 2}May we lift up a word unto thee who art fainting,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
For who has the heart to restrain his speech?

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}see! thou hast instructed many,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}But now that it comes upon thee, thou art faint;

Now that it reaches thyself, thou art terrified.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Is not thy religion thy confidence,

And thy blameless life thy hope?

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Bethink thee: has an innocent man ever perished,

Or when have the just been cut off?

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}By the breath of God they perish,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
At the blast of HIs anger they vanish.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The Lion roared, the hoarse lion thundered:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
But his young lion\uc1\u8217*s teeth were broken.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So for lack of prey he perished,

And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Now to me a word came stealing,

And mine ear caught a whisper thereof,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}In thoughts from the visions of night,

His angels He chargeth with folly.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}How much more those whose houses are clay,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The cord of their tent is torn from them:

 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}So when Job prayed for his friends, Jehovahchanged his fortunes, giving him double of all he {\super\cf2\fs24 11}had before. Then his brothers and sister and oldfriends came \uc1\u8211* every one of them \uc1\u8211* and dinedwith him at his home; and they condoled withhim, and comforted him for all the misery thatJehovah had brought upon him.

Besides, he hadseven sons, and three daughters whom he named {\super\cf2\fs24 14}in the order of their birth Jemimah, Keziah, and {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Keren-happuch.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}For they put no trust in God,

no confidence in his help.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So he summoned the clouds above;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and, opening the doors of heaven,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}he rained manna upon them for food,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and grain of heaven he gave them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Everyone ate the bread of angels;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he sent them food to the full.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}He launched the east wind in the heavens,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and guided the south by his power.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}He rained meat upon them like dust,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
winged bird like the sand of the sea.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
all around their tents.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}They ate and were more than filled;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he had brought them the thing they desired.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}But the thing they desired became loathsome:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
while their food was still in their mouths,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}the wrath of God rose against them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
He slew the stoutest among them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and laid low the young men of Israel.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and refused to believe in his wonders.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 33}So he ended their days in a breath,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and their years in sudden dismay.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 34}When he slew them, then they sought after him,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they turned and sought God with diligence.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}They remembered that God was their rock,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and the Most High God their redeemer.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}But they flattered him with their mouth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and lied to him with their tongue.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Their heart was not steady with him,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they were faithless to his covenant.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 38}But he is full of pity:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he pardons sin and destroys not.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Often he turns his anger away,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
without stirring his wrath at all.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 39}So he remembered that they were but flesh,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
breath that passes and does not return.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 40}But how often they rebelled in the desert,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and caused him grief in the wilderness,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 41}tempting God again and again,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
provoking the Holy One of Israel.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 42}They did not remember his strength,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
nor the day he redeemed from the foe,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}how he set his signs in Egypt,

in the country of Zoan his wonders.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 44}He turned their canals into blood,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
their streams undrinkable.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 45}He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
frogs, too, which destroyed them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 46}Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 47}He slew their vines with hail,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and their sycamore trees with frost.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 48}He delivered their cattle to the hail,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and their flocks to bolts of fire.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 49}He let loose his hot anger among them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
fury and wrath and distress,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
a band of destroying angels.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 50}He cleared a path for his anger,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
did not spare them from death,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
but gave them over to pestilence.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 51}He struck down all the first-born in Egypt,

the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 52}He led forth his people like sheep,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he was guide to his flock in the desert.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 53}Securely he led them, and free from fear,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
while their foes were drowned in the sea.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 54}To his holy realm he brought them,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 55}He drove out the nations before them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and allotted their land for possession,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and their tents for Israel to live in.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 56}Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they did not observe his decrees.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 57}They drew back, false like their ancestors;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they failed like a treacherous bow.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 58}Their shrines stirred him to anger,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
their idols moved him to jealousy.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 59}When God heard of this, he was furious,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and he spurned Israel utterly.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 60}He abandoned his home in Shiloh,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the tent he had pitched among people.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 61}He gave his strength up to captivity,

his glory to the hands of the foe.
\par}

{\pard

 {\super\cf2\fs24 62}He gave his people to the sword,

he was furious with his own.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 63}Fire devoured their young men,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and their maidens had no marriage-song.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 64}Their priests fell by the sword,

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 65}Then the {\scaps Lord} awoke as from sleep,

like a warrior flushed with wine;

 {\super\cf2\fs24 66}and he beat back his foes,

putting them to perpetual scorn.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 67}He disowned the tent of Joseph,

he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;

 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

{\pard

his promise for a thousand generations

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The covenant he made with Abraham,

the oath he swore to Isaac,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
a pact everlasting to Israel

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}to give them the land of Canaan

as the lot which they should inherit.

{\pard

 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And when they were very few,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
few and but pilgrims therein,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}wandering from nation to nation,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
journeying from people to people,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}he allowed no one to oppress them,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
even punishing kings for their sakes.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}He forbade them to touch his anointed,

or do any hurt to his prophets.

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}When he called down famine on the land,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and cut off the bread which sustained them,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}he sent before them a man,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}His feet were galled with fetters,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
he was laid in chains of iron,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}till the time that his word came to pass,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the word of the {\scaps Lord} that had tried him.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}The king sent and freed him,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the ruler of nations released him.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}He made him lord of his household,

and ruler of all his possessions,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}to admonish his princes at will

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and instruct his elders in wisdom.

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Thus Israel came into Egypt,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}His people he made very fruitful,

and mightier than their foes.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}He inspired them to hate his people,

\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}He sent his servant Moses,

and Aaron whom he had chosen,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}portents he wrought in Egypt,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and signs in the land of Ham.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Darkness he sent, and it fell:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
yet they gave no heed to his word.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}He turned their waters into blood,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
thus causing their fish to die.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Their land was alive with frogs,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
swarming even in the royal chambers.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}At his command came flies,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and lice in all their borders.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 32}He gave them hail for rain
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and fire that flashed through the land,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 33}smiting their vines and figs,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
breaking the trees of their border.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 34}At his command came locusts,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
young locusts beyond all counting,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}which ate every herb in the land,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}He struck down in their land all the first-born,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the firstlings of all their strength
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and among his tribes no one was weary.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 38}Egypt was glad when they left,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
for terror had fallen upon them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 39}He spread out a cloud to screen them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and fire to give light in the night.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 40}He sent quails at their entreaty,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and heavenly bread in abundance.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 41}He opened the rock; waters gushed:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
in the desert they ran like a river.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 42}For he remembered his holy promise

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to Abraham his servant.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}So he led out his people with joy,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
his elect with a ringing cry.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 44}And he gave them the lands of the nations,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
the fruit of their toil for possession,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 45}that so they might keep his statutes,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}We, like our fathers, have sinned,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In the land of Egypt our fathers,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
all heedless of your wonders,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and unmindful of your great kindness,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But true to his name he saved them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
in order to show his might.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they marched through the depths as through desert,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}saved from the hand of the hostile,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
redeemed from the hand of the foe.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The waters covered their enemies:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
not one of them was left.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}So then they believed in his words,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and began to sing his praise.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But soon they forgot his deeds:

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they did not wait for his counsel.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they put God to the test in the wilderness.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}He gave them the thing they had asked for,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
but sent wasting disease among them.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}The camp grew jealous of Moses
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and of Aaron, holy one of the {\scaps Lord}.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and covered Abiram\uc1\u8217*s company.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Fire broke out on their company,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
flame kindled upon the wicked.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}They made a calf in Horeb,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and bowed to the molten image.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}They exchanged their glorious God
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
for the image of ox that eats grass.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}They forgot the God who had saved them
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
by mighty deeds in Egypt
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Wonders in the land of Ham,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
terrors by the Red Sea.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
but for Moses his elect,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
who stepped into the breach before him,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to divert his deadly wrath.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}They spurned the delightsome land,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
they refused to believe in his word.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}They grumbled in their tents,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
would not listen to the voice of the {\scaps Lord}.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}So he swore with uplifted hand
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to lay them low in the wilderness;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}to disperse their seed among heathen,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
to scatter them over the world.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and ate what was offered the dead.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and plague broke out among them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Then Phinehas stood between,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and so the plague was stayed;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}and it was counted to him for righteousness
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
unto all generations forever.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 32}They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
through them it went ill with Moses.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 33}They rebelled against his spirit,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and he uttered speech that was rash.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 34}They did not destroy the nations,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
as the {\scaps Lord} had commanded them;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}but they mingled with the heathen,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and learned to do as they did.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}Their idol gods they worshipped,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and they were ensnared by them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}They sacrificed their sons
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and their daughters to the demons.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 38}They poured out innocent blood
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
the blood of their sons and daughters
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
whom they offered to Canaan\uc1\u8217*s idols,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and the land was polluted with blood.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 39}They became unclean by their works,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and adulterous in their deeds.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 40}Then the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s fury was on his people,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
filled with horror at his inheritance.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 41}He delivered them to the heathen,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
to the sway of those who hated them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 42}Their enemies oppressed them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
and subdued them under their hand.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}Many a time he saved them,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
but they rebelled at his counsel,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and were brought low by their wrongdoing.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 44}Yet he looked upon their distress,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
when he heard their cry.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 45}He remembered his covenant,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
and, in his great kindness, relented.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 46}He caused them to be pitied

by all who carried them captive.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 First Narrative
 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 36}In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, after having assaulted and captured all the fortified cities of Judah, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}despatched his Chief Officer from Lachish with a large force against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. Near the conduit of the upper pool, where he had taken up his position on the Fuller\uc1\u8217*s Field Road, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}he was visited by a deputation consisting of Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The Chief Officer began: \uc1\u8223*This is the message from the Great King, the King of Assyria: I desire {\super\cf2\fs24 5}you to deliver it to Hezekiah. \uc1\u8217*What sort of confidence is this that you cherish? Do you imagine that in war a mere word of the lips is the equivalent of wisdom and strength? Now who is it you are {\super\cf2\fs24 6}trusting in, that you presume to rebel against me? Of course you are trusting to Egypt, that staff of broken reed, which will enter and piece the hand of the man that leans upon it: that is all that Pharaoh King of Egypt will prove to those who {\super\cf2\fs24 7}trust to him. If, however, you tell me you are trusting to your God the {\scaps Lord}, why, that is the very god whose sanctuaries and altars Hezekiah has abolished, commanding the people of Judah and Jerusalem to confine their worship to the altar at this {\super\cf2\fs24 8}place? Now, make a wager, if you like, with my lord the King of Assyria: I am prepared to furnish you with two thousand horses, if you on your part {\super\cf2\fs24 9}can supply them with riders. (But if you cannot), how do you propose to repel the onset of one of the least of my lord\uc1\u8217*s officers? yet you trust to Egypt {\super\cf2\fs24 10}for chariots and horsemen. And now do you imagine that I have not the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s sanction for invading this land with a view to its destruction? Why, it is the {\scaps Lord} Himself who commissioned me to invade this land and destroy it.\uc1\u8217*\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Thereupon Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked the Chief Officer to be good enough not to speak to them in Hebrew, in the hearing of the people on the wall, but in Aramaic, which they assured him {\super\cf2\fs24 12}they understood. \uc1\u8223*Nay,\uc1\u8217* replied the Officer, \uc1\u8223*it is not to your lord and yourself that my lord has sent me with this message, but precisely to the men on the wall, whom your policy is likely to reduce to eating their own filth and drinking their own water. \uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then the Chief Officer came forward and cried aloud in Hebrew, \uc1\u8223*Listen to the words of the {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Great King, the King of Assyria. Thus says the King: Do not let yourselves be imposed upon by {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Hezekiah, for he is powerless to deliver you; and do not let yourselves be induced to trust to the {\scaps Lord} by Hezekiah\uc1\u8217*s assurances that the {\scaps Lord} will unquestionably save you, and that this city will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Give no heed to Hezekiah; for thus says the King of Assyria to you, Make your peace with me and surrender, and then everyone shall eat of his own vine and fig-tree, and drink water from his own {\super\cf2\fs24 17}cistern, till I come and take you to a land like your own \uc1\u8211* a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and {\super\cf2\fs24 18}vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you with assurances that the {\scaps Lord} will save you. Has the god of any nation ever rescued his land from the grasp {\super\cf2\fs24 19}of the King of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods Sepharvain? And where are the gods of the land of Samaria? Have they rescued Samaria from {\super\cf2\fs24 20}his grasp? Which of all these national gods has succeeded in rescuing his land from my grasp, that the {\scaps Lord} should now rescue Jerusalem from my {\super\cf2\fs24 21}grasp?\uc1\u8217* To this they answered not a word, they remained silent; for the King had expressly told {\super\cf2\fs24 22}them not to answer him. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder, tore their garments, and returned to Hezekiah, telling him what the Chief Officer had said. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 37}When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went {\super\cf2\fs24 2}into the Temple; and he despatched Eliakim, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, to whom they spoke as follows: \uc1\u8223*A message from Hezekiah! This is a day of trouble, chastisement, and disgrace: for children are come to the birth, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}and there is not strength to bear them. But it may be that the {\scaps Lord} your God will hear the words of the Chief Officer, whom the King of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will punish the word which the {\scaps Lord} your God has heard: so lift up {\super\cf2\fs24 5,6}your prayer for those that remain.\uc1\u8217* And this was the answer that Isaiah returned to the deputation of King Hezekiah\uc1\u8217*s ministers: \uc1\u8223*Tell your master,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8223*that the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s message to him is this: he is not to be afraid of the blasphemous words he has heard from the minions of the King of Assyria. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}\uc1\u8217* Behold,\uc1\u8217* says He, \uc1\u8217*I will inspire him with such a spirit (of panic) that on the strength of a rumour he will return to this own land, and there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall a victim to the sword.\uc1\u8217*\uc1\u8217*

Say, Listen tothis message from Jehovah, all ye men of Judah that {\super\cf2\fs24 3}enter these gates to worship Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your waysand your doings, and I will guarantee this place as your {\super\cf2\fs24 4}permanent home. But put no trust in lying messen-gers, who say: "This is the Temple of Jehovah, the {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah." For ifyou really amend your ways and your doings: ifyou really do justice as between man and man; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}if you abstain from the oppression of the residentalien, the fatherless and the widow, from the shed-ding of innocent blood in this place, and from devotion {\super\cf2\fs24 7}to other gods to your own hurt, then I will guaranteeyou a home here for all time in the land that I gaveyour forefathers.

What! you committheft, murder, adultery, perjury, you burn sacrificeto the Baal, you run after other gods that are {\super\cf2\fs24 10}strange to you; and then you (have the hardihoodto) come and stand before me in this House which iscalled by My name, and say, "Now we are safe" \uc1\u8211* inorder, forsooth, to carry on all these abominations. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}This House which bears My name you regard, do you,as nothing but a robbers\uc1\u8217* cave?

And so it will be now, saith Jehovah. Becauseyou have perpetrated all these anormities, in defianceof My most earnest and repeated words, and have {\super\cf2\fs24 14}refused to respond to My call, therefore this Templein which you repose your trust \uc1\u8211* called by My namethough it be \uc1\u8211* and the place that I gave to you andyour forefathers, I will consign to the same fate as {\super\cf2\fs24 15}overtook Shiloh; and I will hurl you out of My sightas I have hurled your brethren, the whole race ofEphraim.

But the commandment Igave them was this: Listen, I said, to My voice, andthen I will be your God and you shall be My people,and take My commandments as the standard of all {\super\cf2\fs24 24}your life \uc1\u8211* this is the way to prosperity.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 26}In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of{\super\cf2\fs24 1}Josiah, king of Judah, the message which follows came {\super\cf2\fs24 2}(to Jeremiah) from Jehovah: Thus saith Jehovah,Take thy stand in the Temple court, and declare with-out reservation to all the people of Judah who are cometo worship in the Temple, the whole message that I {\super\cf2\fs24 3}have commissioned thee to declare. It may be thatthey will listen and severally abandon their wickedways: if they do, I will relent and not bring upon themthe calamity I am planning as penalty for their evil {\super\cf2\fs24 4}behaviour. This, then, is what thou art to say tothem, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye refuse to obey Me\uc1\u8211*to live in accordance with the law that I have set before {\super\cf2\fs24 5}you, and to listen, as ye have never yet listened, to thewords of My servants the prophets, whom early and {\super\cf2\fs24 6}late I have been sending to you \uc1\u8211* then I will make thisTemple like Shiloh, and as for this city, I will turn itinto an object of execration to every nation in the world.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Now the audience that listened to this message ofJeremiah\uc1\u8217*s in the Temple included not only the wholebody of the people, but the priests and the prophets {\super\cf2\fs24 8}as well. So when he had concluded the message whichJehovah had commissioned him to declare to the whole {\super\cf2\fs24 9}people, the priests and the prophets seized him. "Youmust die," they exclaimed; "for how dare youdeliver in the name of Jehovah such a message as this,that this Temple will meet the fate of Shiloh, and thatthis city shall become an inhabited desolation?"At this juncture all the people began to crowd roundJeremiah in the Temple.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Now echoes of this tumult having reached the earsof the countries of Judah, they proceeded from thepalace up to the Temple; and after they had takentheir seats at the entrance to the new gate of the Temple, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}the priests and the prophets addressed themselves tothe countries and the whole body of the people. "Thisman." they said, "is guilty of a capital offence; forhe has solemnly declared that this city is doomed\uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}you have heard him with your own ears. ThenJeremiah in his turn addressed himself to the courtiersand to the whole body of the people. "It is JehovahHimself," he said, "that has sent me to proclaim uponthis Temple and city the doom which you have just {\super\cf2\fs24 13}heard. If, however, you amend your life and con-duct, and listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, thenHe will relent and cancel His threat of catastrophe. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}As for myself, I am in your hands: deal with me as {\super\cf2\fs24 15}you think right and proper. But be very sure of this,that, if you put me to death, you will only be bringinginnocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, andupon her people; for it is the simple truth that Jehovahhas sent me to deliver this message in your hearing." {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Thereupon, the courtiers and all the people said to thepriests and the prophets, "This man is not guilty ofany capital offence; for his message to us has behindit the authority of Jehovah our God."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Them some of the elders, rising to their feet, thus ad- {\super\cf2\fs24 18}dressed the people assembled: "In the days of Hezekiah,king of Judah," they said, "Micah of Moresheth wasprophesying; and this is what he said to all the peopleof Judah:Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:Like a field shall Zion be ploughed,

 {\cf1 28}The same year, at the beginning of the reign of{\super\cf2\fs24 1}Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourthyear, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, whobelonged to Gibeon, addressed me as follows in theTemple in the presence of the priests and of all the {\super\cf2\fs24 2}people. "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God ofIsrael: \uc1\u8217*I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Within two years\uc1\u8217* time I will bring back to this place allthe Temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, king ofBabylon took from this place and carried to Babylon; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}and Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, andall the exiles of Judah that have gone to Babylon, Iwill bring back to this place, saith Jehovah; for I willbreak the yoke of the king of Babylon.\uc1\u8217*"

 {\cf1 32}The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah{\super\cf2\fs24 1}in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which {\super\cf2\fs24 2}was in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At thattime the forces of the king of Babylon were investingJerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined to {\super\cf2\fs24 3}the guard-house of the royal palace, where Zedekiah theking had shut him up on account of his propheticpreaching. "What do you mean," he had demanded,"by an announcement of this kind: \uc1\u8217*Thus saithJehovah, Depend upon it, I will give this city into thehands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Nor shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape the hands ofthe Chaldeans; he will assuredly be delivered into thehands of the king of Babylon. He shall speak to him {\super\cf2\fs24 5}face to face, and see him eye to eye; and he shall bringZedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain till I visithim.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Now there came to Jeremiah the following message {\super\cf2\fs24 7}from Jehovah: "Hanamel, the son of thine uncleShallum, is about to pay thee a visit, to request thee tobuy the land he holds at Anathoth; and he will urgethat, as thou art the next of kin, it is thy privilege and {\super\cf2\fs24 8}duty to receive it." And so it happened: my cousinHanamel paid me in the guard-house the visit Jehovahhad intimated, and said: "I want you to buy the landI possess at Anathoth; for you are the legal heir, andit is your duty to secure it \uc1\u8211* so buy it for yourself."Then I recognised that the message I had received was {\super\cf2\fs24 9}really from Jehovah. So I bought the land at Anathothfrom my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the money {\super\cf2\fs24 10}to him \uc1\u8211* seventeen silver shekels. Then I signed thedeed and sealed it, took witnesses, and paid him the {\super\cf2\fs24 11}money in full. I then took the purchase-deed\uc1\u8211*the one which was sealed and the one which was open\uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son ofMachesiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, andof the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deed {\super\cf2\fs24 13}and of all the Jews in the guard-house. In theirpresence I then gave these instructions to Baruch: {\super\cf2\fs24 14}"Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Take these deeds \uc1\u8211* this purchase deed which is sealedand this deed which is open \uc1\u8211* and put them in anearthenware jar, so that they may be preserved for a {\super\cf2\fs24 15}long time to come.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 36}In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah,{\super\cf2\fs24 1}king of Judah, Jeremiah received the following message {\super\cf2\fs24 2}from Jehovah: Take a book-roll, and write on it allthe messages I have communicated to thee with regardto Israel and Judah and all nations, from My firstmessage to thee in the days of Josiah right on to the {\super\cf2\fs24 3}present day. It may be that, when the people ofJudah hear of all the misery I am planning to bringupon them, they will severally abandon their wickedways, and receive at My hands pardon for their guiltand sin.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then Jeremiah summoned Baruch, the son of Neriah,who wrote down on a book-roll to Jeremiah\uc1\u8217*s dic-tation all the messages Jehovah had communicated to {\super\cf2\fs24 5}him. Thereafter Jeremiah gave instructions toBaruch in the following terms: "Seeing that I ampersonally under restraint and debarred from access {\super\cf2\fs24 6}to the Temple, do you go and, on the day appointedfor fasting, read aloud in the Temple the messages ofJehovah in the hearing of the people from the rollwhich you have written to my dictation; read themalso in the hearing of the Judeans who come from their {\super\cf2\fs24 7}respective country towns. It may be that they willhumbly supplicate Jehovah, and severally abandontheir wicked ways: for great is the anger and fury {\super\cf2\fs24 8}with which Jehovah has threatened this people." Inaccordance, therefore with his instructions fromJeremiah the prophet, Baruch read aloud from thebook the words of Jehovah in the Temple.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakimthe son of Josiah, king of Judah, a sacred fast wasproclaimed by all the people resident in Jerusalem,and all those also present from the country towns of {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Judah. Then in the hearing of all the people Baruchread from the book the messages of Jeremiah from theroom that belonged to Gemariah, the son of Shaphanthe Secretary of State, which was situated in the upper {\super\cf2\fs24 11}court at the entrance to the new Temple gate. Nowwhen Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son ofShaphan, had heard the messages of Jehovah as they {\super\cf2\fs24 12}were read from the book, he went down to the palaceto the room of the Secretary of State, and there he foundthe whole court seated \uc1\u8211* Elishama, the Secretary andDelaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elanthan, theson of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, andZedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and indeed the whole {\super\cf2\fs24 13}court. Micaiah proceeded to inform them of all thewords he had heard Baruch read out of the book in the {\super\cf2\fs24 14}hearing of the people. The whole court accordinglydespatched a messenger to Baruch, namely one Jehudi,the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son ofCushi, with instructions to Baruch to appear, bring-ing with him the roll from which he had read in thehearing of the people. So Baruch, the son of Neriah,appeared before them with the roll in his hand.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then they told him to sit down and read it in their {\super\cf2\fs24 16}hearing; so Baruch read while they listened. Whenthey had heard it all, they turned to one another inconsternation, exclaiming to Baruch that they were {\super\cf2\fs24 17}bound to inform the king of all this. They thenasked Baruch to explain how he had written all these {\super\cf2\fs24 18}words. Baruch replied that Jeremiah had dictatedthem all to him, and he had written them down with {\super\cf2\fs24 19}ink in the book. "Well, then," said the princes toBaruch, "go into hiding, you and Jeremiah, and let {\super\cf2\fs24 20}nobody know where you are." After they haddeposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama theSecretary, they visited the king in his apartment,and reported the whole matter to him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The king then despatched Jehudi to fetch the roll;and, when he had brought it form Elishama\uc1\u8217*s chamber,he read it in the hearing of the king and of all the {\super\cf2\fs24 22}courtiers who were in attendance upon him. Nowthe king was sitting in the winter house, and the {\super\cf2\fs24 23}fire on the brazier was burning before him; andevery three or four columns that Jehudi read, the kingwould cut up with his penknife and fling into the firethat was on the brazier, till the whole roll was con- {\super\cf2\fs24 24}sumed in the fire that was on the brazier. But therewas no sense of horror either on the part of the kingor of any of his ministers as they listened to all these {\super\cf2\fs24 25}words, nor did they rend their garments. Elnathan,Delaiah, and Gemariah, however, had entreated theking not to burn the roll, but he would not listen to {\super\cf2\fs24 26}them. Then the king commanded the royal princeJerachmeel, and seraiah, the son of Azriel, andShelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribeand Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah kept them inconcealment.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}After the king had burned the roll containing thewords written by Baruch to Jeremiah\uc1\u8217*s dictation, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Jeremiah received this message from Jehovah, "Oncemore take another roll, and write on it all the wordsthat were on the first roll that was consigned to the {\super\cf2\fs24 29}flames by Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Thus saithJehovah: Thou hast taken it upon thee to burn thisroll and to demand my reason for recording the threatthat the king of Babylon would assuredly come and {\super\cf2\fs24 30}destroy this land, and clear it of man and beast. There-fore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king ofJudah: Never a man shall he have to sit upon thethrone of David; his dead body shall be flung out and {\super\cf2\fs24 31}exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night. Iwill punish him, his descendants, and his ministers, fortheir sins; and I will bring upon them and upon thecitizens of Jerusalem all the misery with which Ithreatened them in vain."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720

He had just reached the Benjamingate when he was apprehended there by a sentrynamed Jirijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son ofHananiah, who called out, "You are deserting to the {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Chaldeans." "It is false, said Jeremiah, "I amnot deserting to the Chaldeans." But Jirijah, refusingto listen, apprehended Jeremiah and brought him {\super\cf2\fs24 15}before the courtiers, who in their exasperation hadJeremiah flogged and put in the house of Jonathan,the Secretary of State, which they had turned into a {\super\cf2\fs24 16}prison.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then King Zedekiah sent for him and questionedhim secretly in his house whether there was any com-munication from Jehovah. "There is," said Jeremiah;"you will be delivered into the hands of the king of {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Babylon.

Also, "Thus saithJehovah, This city shall most assuredly be deliveredinto the hands of the king of Babylon\uc1\u8217*s army, and {\super\cf2\fs24 4}it shall be captured." Whereupon those courtierssaid to the king, "We petition you to have this fellowput to death: this sort of talk is unnerving all thepeople and the soldiers left in the city. This fellow {\super\cf2\fs24 5}does not want to help the city, but to ruin it." "Heis in your power," said the king; for he was helpless {\super\cf2\fs24 6}against them.

"If I tell you," said Jeremiah, "areyou not certain to put me to death? besides, any advice {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I give you, you will simply disregard."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The day after the murder of Gedaliah, of which no {\super\cf2\fs24 5}one was yet aware, eighty pilgrims from Shechem,Shiloh, and Samaria, with beards shaven, clothes rentand gashes (on their bodies), came with vegetable offer-ings and frankincense in their hand to present them at {\super\cf2\fs24 6}the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went out from Mizpahto meet them, and they were weeping as they wentalong. When he meet them, he invited them to come to {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Gedaliah; but when they were well within the town,he and the men who accompanied him slew them at {\super\cf2\fs24 8}the cistern. Ten of their number, however, entreatedIshmael not to kill them: "for we have stores ofwheat," they said, "and barley, oil, and honey, buriedin the ground." So he let them alone and did not {\super\cf2\fs24 9}consign them to the doom of their brethren. Nowthe cistern into which Ishmael had cast all the corpsesof the men he had slain was the great cistern whichhad been constructed by king Asa in his war againstBaasha, king of Israel; and this Ishmael filled with theslain.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of thepeople that were at Mizpah, the princesses and all thepeople left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the com-mander of the guard, had committed to the charge ofGedaliah, the son of Ahikam; and he started across to {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Ammon. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, andall the commanders of the forces that were with him, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}heard of all the atrocities perpetrated by Ishmael, theytook all their men and set out to attack him; and they {\super\cf2\fs24 13a}found him by the great waters of Gibeon. All the {\super\cf2\fs24 14a}people with Ishmael \uc1\u8211* all that he had carried captive {\super\cf2\fs24 13b}from Mizpah \uc1\u8211* when they saw Johanan and the com-manders of the forces that were with him, were filled {\super\cf2\fs24 14b}with joy; and turning about, they came back and {\super\cf2\fs24 15}joined Johanan. But Ishmael, escaping with eightmen, repaired to Ammon.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then Johanan and all the commanders of the forcesthat were with him, tool all the rest of the people whomIshmael had carried away captive from Mizpah, afterhis assassination of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam \uc1\u8211* men,women, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Gibeon. Then they took their journey and stayedawhile at the sheepfolds of Chimham in the neighbour-hood of Bethlehem, from which they intended to {\super\cf2\fs24 18}travel to Egypt; for they were in terror of theChaldeans, because Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah,whom the king of Babylon had appointed Governor ofthe land.

  {\cf1 42}Then all the commanders of the forces, together{\super\cf2\fs24 1}with Johanan, and Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and {\super\cf2\fs24 2}all the people great and small, approached Jeremiahthe prophet with a petition, which they commended tohis most favourable consideration, that he would prayfor them, remnant as they were, to Jehovah his God."We are left," they said, "but a few out of many, as {\super\cf2\fs24 3}you see with your own eyes. Let Jehovah your Godtell us the way we should go and the things we should do." {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Jeremiah replied, "I have heard you; I promise topray to Jehovah our God, as you request; and what-ever be Jehovah\uc1\u8217*s answer I will tell you unreservedly." {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Whereupon they said to Jeremiah, "Jehovah be ourtrue and faithful Witness that we will act entirely inaccordance with any message that Jehovah your God {\super\cf2\fs24 6}may send us. We have sent you to Jehovah our God;and, be it welcome or unwelcome, we will obey Hisvoice, and so enjoy the prosperity that comes fromobedience to the voice of Jehovah our God."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}After an interval of ten days, Jeremiah received a {\super\cf2\fs24 8}message from Jehovah. He accordingly summonedJohanan and all the commanders of the forces thatwere with him, and all the people, small and great, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and thus he addressed them. "Thus saith Jehovah,the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your {\super\cf2\fs24 10}supplication: If you remain quitely in this land, I willbuild you up and not throw you down; I will plant youand not pluck you up: for I am grieved at the misery {\super\cf2\fs24 11}I have brought upon you. You are afraid of the king ofBabylon, but do not be afraid of him, saith Jehovah;do not be afraid of him, for I will be with you, to save {\super\cf2\fs24 12}you and to deliver you from his hand. I will havepity upon you and inspire him with pity for you, sothat he will allow you to remain in your own land. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}You may, however, disregard the voice of Jehovah your {\super\cf2\fs24 14}God, and refuse to remain in this land: you may say,\uc1\u8217*No; we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shallsee no war and hear no sound of trumpet and neversuffer for lack of bread \uc1\u8211* and there we shall make our {\super\cf2\fs24 15}home.\uc1\u8217* In that case I call upon you that are left ofJudah to listen to the message of Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you are reallydetermined to proceed to Egypt, and if you go and settle {\super\cf2\fs24 16}there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake youthere in the land of Egypt, and the hunger that youdread shall cling to your heels there in Egypt, and there {\super\cf2\fs24 17}ye shall die; and all the men that were determinedto go and settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, famine,and pestilence; not one shall survive or escape the dis- {\super\cf2\fs24 18}aster that I will bring upon them. For thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine angerand fury have been poured out upon the inhabitants ofJerusalem, so shall My fury be poured out upon youwhen ye enter Egypt; and ye shall be an object ofexecration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and yeshall see this place no more.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This is Jehovah\uc1\u8217*s message to you that are left ofJudah: \uc1\u8217*Do not go to Egypt.\uc1\u8217* But now be very sure {\super\cf2\fs24 20}of this \uc1\u8211* I this day lay witness against you; you havedone yourselves a grievous wrong. You have sentme to Jehovah your God with the request that I shouldpray for you to Jehovah, and promising to act inentire accordance with the will of Jehovah when I {\super\cf2\fs24 21}declared it to you; but when I did declare it this day,you refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah in respect {\super\cf2\fs24 22}of any part of my commission. Now therefore be verysure of this, that ye shall die by the sword, famine,and pestilence, in the land where it is your desire togo and settle."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 43}When Jeremiah had finished addressing to the{\super\cf2\fs24 1}assembled people all these words with which Jehovah {\super\cf2\fs24 2}had commissioned him, Azariah, the son of Hoshaniah,and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the defiant andinsolent men exclaimed to Jeremiah, "You are a liar;you have no commission to us from Jehovah to warn {\super\cf2\fs24 3}us against going and settling in Egypt; but it is Baruchthe son of Neriah who is setting you on against us withthe object of delivering us into the hands of theChaldeans, to be killed or transported to Babylon." {\super\cf2\fs24 4}So Johanan and all the commanders of the forces andall the people refused to listen to the voice of Jehovahwhich urged them to remain in the land of Judah. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Accordingly Johanan and all the commanders of theforces took all that were now left of Judah \uc1\u8211* those thathad come back from all the nations to which they had {\super\cf2\fs24 6}been driven, to settle in the land of Judah \uc1\u8211* the men,the women, the princesses, and all the persons whomNebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had leftin the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the sonof Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch {\super\cf2\fs24 7}the son of Neriah; and, disregarding the voice ofJehovah, they went to Egypt and arrived at Daphnae.

 {\cf1 44}Concerning all the Jews whose home was in Egypt\uc1\u8211*{\super\cf2\fs24 1}at Migdol, Daphnae, Memphis, and in upper Egypt\uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Jeremiah received the following message: "Thussaith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Ye haveseen with your own eyes all the misery that I havewrought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities ofJudah. Ye see what they are to-day \uc1\u8211* desolate and {\super\cf2\fs24 3}uninhabited \uc1\u8211* as a consequence of their wicked be-haviour which provoked Mine indignation; for theywent and burned sacrifice in the service of other gods,unknown alike to them or to you or your forefathers; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}and that, though early and late I had been sending to youMy servants the prophets to warn you against these {\super\cf2\fs24 5}abominable practices that I detest. But they refusedto listen or incline their ear: they would no abandon {\super\cf2\fs24 6}their wickedness or cease sacrificing to other gods. Andso Mine anger and fury were poured forth: it blazed inthe cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, sothat they became the waste and the desolation thatthey are to-day.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Now, therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts,the God of Israel: Why are ye doing yourselves thisgreat wrong, which can only end in the utter extermin-ation of Judah, man and woman, child and babe? {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Why are ye vexing Me with the fabrications of yourhands, burning sacrifice to other gods in the land ofEgypt, where ye have come to settle? All thiscan only end in your extermination and in your beingcursed and scorned by every nation in the world. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Have you forgotten the crimes of your forefathers andof the kings and princes of Judah, the crimes, too,your own wives committed in the land of Judah and on {\super\cf2\fs24 10}the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they haveremained unhumbled and unafraid. They have notlived in accordance with My law or with the statutesI set before you and your forefathers. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God ofIsrael: Mark this \uc1\u8211* I will set My face against you for {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Evil, to exterminate Judah utterly. I will take theremnant of Judah that were determined to come andsettle in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Egyptthey shall all be consumed; they shall fall by the swordand by famine; small and great, they shall die by thesword and by famine, and they shall be an object of {\super\cf2\fs24 13}execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and,as I have punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, andpestilence, so will I punish those that have made Egypt {\super\cf2\fs24 14}their home, that not a man of the remnant of Judahwhich has come to settel in Egypt shall escape orsurvive to return to the land of Egypt for whichthey shall yearn; for none but a fugitive or twoshall return."
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then the great gathering, composed of all the menwho were aware that their wives burned sacrifice toother gods, and all the women that were standing by, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}replied to Jeremiah thus: "We refuse to listen to thismessage of yours that you have communicated to us in {\super\cf2\fs24 17}the name of Jehovah: but we will most assuredlykeep our solemn oath to burn sacrifice to the Queenof Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in herhonour as we used to do \uc1\u8211* we and our fathers, ourkings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and on thestreets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we {\super\cf2\fs24 18}lived well and were untouched by misfortune. Butever since the day we ceased burning sacrifice to theQueen of Heaven and pouring out drink-offerings inher honour, we have been utterly destitute, and sword {\super\cf2\fs24 19}and famine have consumed us. Yes," said the women,"as for our offering of sacrifice to the Queen of Heavenand pouring out drink-offerings in her honour \uc1\u8211* havewe not had the approval of our husbands in making cakesfor her stamped with her image, and in pouring herout drink-offerings?"
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Such was the answer of all the people, men andwomen. Then Jeremiah addressed them as follows: {\super\cf2\fs24 21}"Yes, you did indeed burn your sacrifices in the cities ofJudah and on the streets of Jerusalem \uc1\u8211* you and yourfathers, your kings and your princes and commons;and is it not precisely this that rankled in the mind and {\super\cf2\fs24 22}heart of Jehovah, till He could bear your wicked andabominable conduct no longer, with the result that yourcountry is become the uninhabited desolation, the {\super\cf2\fs24 23}horror, the curse that it is to-day? It is because youhave offered such sacrifces, sinning against Jehovah, dis-obeying the voice of Jehovah, refusing to live inaccordance with His laws.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Further, Jeremiah said to the people and the womenassembled: "Listen to the message of Jehovah, all ye {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Jews that are in the land of Egypt. Thus saith Jehovahof Hosts, the God of Israel: Verily you womenhave indeed carried out your solemn resolve faithfullyto perform the vows you have taken upon you, to burnsacrifice to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in her honour. Well, then, keep your word {\super\cf2\fs24 26}and perform your vows. But listen now to the world ofJehovah, all ye Jews who have made Egypt your home.Mark this well: I have sworn, saith Jehovah, by Mygreat name, that never again in all the land of Egyptshall My name be uttered by the lips of any man ofJudah in the oath \uc1\u8217*As truly as the Lord Jehovah {\super\cf2\fs24 27}liveth.\uc1\u8217* Mark!

 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Jerusalem hath grievously sinned,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
When the Lord, in His fierce indignation,

Did put me to grief?
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}He hurled down fire from on high;

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
A net He hath spread for my feet;

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
He hath turned me backward.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Faint He hath left me and desolate

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
All the day long.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}A watch He hath kept on my sins;

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And into a yoke
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For my neck with His hands He hath twined them.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Then, crippling my strength,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
He hath given me into the hands
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Of a foe irresistible.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The Lord hath hurled to the ground
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
All the strong men within me.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
He hath summoned a festal assembly

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
To crush my young (warriors).
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Nebuchadnezzar\uc1\u8217*s court

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The {\scaps Lord} handed King Jehoiakim over to him, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them off to the land of Shinar to the temple of his god, and placed them in the temple treasury.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}The king commanded Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring to him some of the Israelite princes and nobles. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}They were to be young men who were without physical defect and handsome, comfortable with all types of knowledge, well taught and quick to learn and able to serve in the king\uc1\u8217*s palace. They were to be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The king gave to them each day some of his rich food and some of the wine which he drank. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}He also commanded that they should be taught for three years, and that at the end of that time they should enter the royal service.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Among these young men were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}but the chief of the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuchs gave other names to them. To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abednego.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But Daniel made up his mind not to become ritually unclean by being contaminated by the rich food of the king nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked the chief of the king\uc1\u8217*s eunuchs to help him avoid it. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}God helped Daniel to win the kindness and favor of the chief.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, \uc1\u8216*I fear that my lord, the king, who has given you your food and your drink, will see that your faces are sadder than those of young men who are your own age, and so you will endanger my head with the king.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So Daniel went to the guardian whom the chief of the eunuchs had put over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and said {\super\cf2\fs24 12}\uc1\u8216*Test us for ten days; and let us have vegetables to eat and water to drink. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then compare the way we look with that of the young men who eat of the king\uc1\u8217*s rich food. Then do to us as seems best.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So he did as they asked and tested them for ten days. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}At the end of ten days they looked better and they were healthier than all the young men who ate the king\uc1\u8217*s rich food. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}So the guardian took away their rich food and the wine and gave them vegetables.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}To these four young men God gave knowledge, learning, and wisdom; and Daniel understood all kinds of visions and dreams.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}On the date which the king had fixed for introducing all the young men to the court, the chief of his eunuchs brought them to Nebuchadnezzar, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}and the king talked with them. But not one of all the young men was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve the king. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}On every subject which called for wisdom and understanding and about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the wise men and magicians who were in his entire kingdom.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Daniel remained at the court until the start of the reign of King Cyrus.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 2}Nebuchadnezzar in the second year of his reign had dreams, and his mind was so troubled that he could not sleep. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Then the king sent for the magicians and the wise men, and the Chaldaens (who studied the stars) to tell him what his dreams meant. So they came in before the king, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and he said to them, \uc1\u8216*I have had a dream and my mind is troubled, for I want to know what the dream means.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then those who studied the stars said to the king in Aramaic: \uc1\u8216*O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will tell you what it means.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The king answered, \uc1\u8216*What I now say is certain: if you do not tell me the dream and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be maderuins. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But if you tell the dream and what it means, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honors; therefore tell me the dream and what it means.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}They answered the second time, \uc1\u8216*Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will tell what it means.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The king replied, \uc1\u8216*I see clearly that you wish to gain time, for you know that what I have said is certain, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and that if you do not tell the dream to me, you will all suffer the same punishment. So you have planned to speak lying and false words before me, until the time when it is to happen has passed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me what it means.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The Chaldeans answered the king, \uc1\u8216*There is no man on earth who can do what the king asks, for no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any wise man or magician, or of one who studies the stars. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}What the king asks is too hard. There is no one else who can tell it to the king, except the gods, who do not live among mortals.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}This made the king very angry and he ordered all the wise men of Babylon put to death.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}So the command was given that the wise men were to be put to death. Search was made for Daniel and his friends that they too might be put to death. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then Daniel approached Arioch, the captain of the king\uc1\u8217*s guard, who had gone out to put the wise men of Babylon to death, and quietly and carefully asked, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8216*Why is the king\uc1\u8217*s command so harsh?\uc1\u8217* When Arioch told Daniel the facts, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}he went to the king and asked that he give him time to tell what the dream meant.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then Daniel went to his house and told the facts to his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, so that they might beg the God of heaven to be kind to them and to tell Daniel this secret, so that they might not die with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Then the secret was told to Daniel in a vision at night, and he praised the God of heaven and said:

 {\cf1 6}It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty officers who ruled the whole kingdom, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and over them three chief officials, of whom Daniel was one, so that these officers might report to them and that the king should lose nothing. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Daniel was better than the other chief officials and the officers, for he had a fine spirit; and the king intended to set him over the whole empire.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then the chief officials and the officers tried to find a way to accuse Daniel of not having done his duty, but they could not find anything against him, for he was faithful and was not guilty of any mistake or wrong-doing.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Then these men said, \uc1\u8216*We will not find any way to accuse this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So these chief officials and officers all went to the king, and said to him, \uc1\u8216*King Darius, live forever. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}All the chief officials of the kingdom, the counsellors and the officers, the judges and the governors, have consulted together to have the king make a law and give a strong command that whoever will ask a petition of any god or person for thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into a den of lions. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Now, O king, give the command and sign the law that, like the law of the Medes and Persians, it may not be changed.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}So King Darius signed the law and the command.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}When Daniel learnt that the law was signed, he went into his house. His windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem, and he knelt upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks to his God as he had done before. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Then these men rushed in and found Daniel praying and calling upon his God. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}So they went before the king and spoke to him about the royal command: \uc1\u8216*Have you not signed a command, that everyone who asks a petition of any person or god within thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?\uc1\u8217* The king answered, \uc1\u8216*The rule is fixed according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then they went on to say to the king, \uc1\u8216*Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, nor to the command that you have signed, but prays three times a day.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}When the king heard these words, he was greatly displeased, and set his heart on saving Daniel, and he worked until the sun set to save him. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then these men all went to the king and said to him, \uc1\u8216*Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no command nor law which the king gives may be changed.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}So the king gave his command, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, \uc1\u8216*Your God, whom you always serve, will save you.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then a stone was brought and laid at the entrance to the den; and the king sealed it with his own seal-ring and with those of his nobles, that no change might be made so as to rescue Daniel. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fastingalone; he could not sleep.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king rose and hurried to the den of lions. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he called anxiously, \uc1\u8216*Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to save you from the lions?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Daniel said to the king, \uc1\u8216*O king, live forever. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}My God has sent his angel and has closed the lions\uc1\u8221* mouths, and they have not hurt me, for I was innocent before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Then the king was very glad and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and it was found that he was not injured, for he had trusted in his God.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Then the king commanded that those men who had accused Daniel should be brought and thrown into the den of lions, with their wives and children. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions pounced on them and tore them to pieces.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and races in all his kingdom, \uc1\u8216*May your peace be great! {\super\cf2\fs24 26}I make a law that throughout all my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and is the same forever, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed; and his rule will be without end. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}He saves and rescues, and does wonderful things in heaven and earth; it is he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Vision of the great beasts

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 7}In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8216*I saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The first was like a lion and had eagle\uc1\u8217*s wings. I looked until its wings were stripped off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a person; and a human heart was given to it. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And I saw a second beast, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth, between its teeth; and they said to it: \uc1\u8220*Arise, devour much flesh.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}After this I saw another like a leopard, which had upon its sides four wings of a bird; and the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}After this I saw in the night-visions a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the rest with its feet; and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}While I considered the horns, another little horn came up among them, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; in this horn were eyes, like human eyes, and a mouth speaking arrogrant things.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}\uc1\u8216*I waited until thrones were set up, and an aged one took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and his hair like spotless wool, his throne was fiery flames, its wheels burning fire. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}A fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books were opened.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}\uc1\u8216*I looked at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words which the horn spoke \uc1\u8211* I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to be fuel for the fire. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Also the rule of the rest of the beasts was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a fixed time and season.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}\uc1\u8216*I saw in the night-visions that there came with the clouds of heaven one like a human being, and he came even to the Aged One, and was brought near before him. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}There was given him dominion and glory, and sovereignty, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away, and his sovereignty one which will not be destroyed.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved by reason of this, and the visions of my head troubled me. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me the interpretation of the things: {\super\cf2\fs24 17}\uc1\u8216*These four great beasts are four kings who will arise out of the earth. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, and possess the sovereignty for ever, for ever and ever.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet: {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three horns fell \uc1\u8211* it that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, and it appeared to be greater than the rest. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}I looked, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them, {\super\cf2\fs24 22}until the Aged One came, and judgment was given to the holy one of the Most High, and the fixed time came that the holy ones possessed the sovereignty.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Thus he said: \uc1\u8216*The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms; and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the holy ones of the Most High; and he will think to change the fixed times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his kingdom, to consume and to destroy finally. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}The sovereignty, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will surely be given to the holy people of the Most High; his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and all dominions will serve and obey him.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and I turned pale, but I kept the matter in my mind.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Vision of the ram and goat

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 8}In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision came to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me previously.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}I saw in a vision \uc1\u8211* and when I saw, I was in the Shushan, the royal palace, which is in the province of Elam \uc1\u8211* and I saw in a vision, and I was by the River Ulai. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then I looked up and saw standing before the river a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could escape, but he did as he pleased and exulted himself.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}As I was observing, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}He came to the ram that had two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}I saw him come close to the ram, and he was angered against him, and stuck the ram, and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to stand before him, but he threw him down to the ground and trampled upon him, and none could rescue the ram from him. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The he-goat exulted himself exceedingly; and when he had become strong, the great horn was broken. In its place there came up four other horns toward the four winds of heaven.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Out of one of them came another little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host, and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}It exulted itself even to the prince of the host, and took away from him the daily sacrifice, and threw down the place of his sanctuary, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and it set up the sacrilegious tithing over the daily sacrifice, and threw down truth to the ground, and did it and prospered.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one who spoke, \uc1\u8216*For how long will the vision be that the daily sacrifice will be taken away and the appalling sacrilege set up and the sanctuary and the host trampled under foot?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}He answered, \uc1\u8216*For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then will the sanctuary be justified.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and suddenly there stood before me one who had the appearance of a man. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I heard a human voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, \uc1\u8216*Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So he came near where I stood; and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face, but he said to me, \uc1\u8216*Understand, mortal, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright in my place. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}He said, \uc1\u8216*I will make you know what will be in the time of wrath, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}The ram which you saw, with the two horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between his eyes is the first king. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}As for that which was broken so that four stood up in its place, four kingdoms will arise out of his nation, but not with his power. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}In the later days of their rule, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king defiant and skilled in dissimulation will stand up. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}His power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will utter monstrous things, and will achieve, and will destroy the mighty ones. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}His cleverness will be directed against the holy people; he will succeed through deceit, and devise great things, and he will destroy many unawares; he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be destroyed, but not by human hands. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but hide the vision for it belongs to many days to come.\uc1\u8217*

He will return and fix his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant. {\super\cf2\fs24 31}Forces sent by him will prevail, and they will profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and will take away the daily offering and set up the appalling abomination. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}He will pervert by specious promises, those who bring guilt upon the covenant; but the people who know their God will be valiant and do exploits.

For the land is continually going a-whoring from after Jehovah.

And when she conceived and bore him a son,  {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Jehovah said:

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For yet a little while

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And I will avenge the blood shed at Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,

And I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.

{\super\cf2\fs24 5}And it shall come to pass in that day,

Since they are children of whoredom,

{\super\cf2\fs24 15}And I will give her from there her vineyards,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And the valley of Achori as a door of hope,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
As in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 16}And it shall be in that day, is the oracle of Jehovah,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
She shall call to her husband,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And shall call no more to the Baalim.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 17}And I will remove the name of the Baitlim from her mouth,

And they shall no more be mentioned by their names.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 18}And I will betroth her to me forever,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 19}Yea, I will betroth hers to me in righteousness,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And in judgment, and in kindness, and in mercy,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 20}Yea, I will betroth her to me in faithfulness and she shall knowJehovah!
\par}

{\pard 
 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 21}And it shall come to pass in that day,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
That I will speak, \uc1\u8212* it is the oracle of Jehovah,\uc1\u8212*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I will speak to the heavens,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they will speak to the earth. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 22}And the earth will speak to the grain,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And the new wine and the oil:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they shall speak to Jezreel,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And I will sow her in the land. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 23}And I will have pity upon the unpitied,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And I will say to Not-my-people, <<Thou art my people,>>
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they will say, <<Thou art my God.>>  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 2}And I will make for them a covenant in that day,  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 18}With the wild beasts, and the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the earth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And the bow and the sword and war I will completely destroy from out the land, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And I will make them lie down in safety.  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 1}And the number of the Israelites shall be as the sand of the sea,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 10}Which cannot be measured or numbered;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And instead of its being said of them, <<Ye are not my people,>> 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They shall be called, <<The sons of the living God.>> 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 11}And the Judahites and the Israelites shall be gathered together,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they shall appoint for themselves one head, and they shall go up out of the land,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For great shall he the day of Jezreel.  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 2 }Say ye to your brother, <<My people>> and to your sister, <<Pitied>>.  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 4}Hear the word of Jehovah, O Israelites,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 1}For Jehovah hath a charge against the inhabitants of the land,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For there is no fidelity, nor true love,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Nor knowledge of God in the land, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 2}But perjury, lying, and murder,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 3}Therefore the land mourns,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And all its inhabitants languish,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Together with the wild beasts and the birds of the heavens,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
While even the fish of the sea are swept away, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 3}Yet let none bring charges,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And let none reprove,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Since my people are but as their priestlings, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 5}O priest, thou shalt stumble by day,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And the prophet also shall stumble with thee,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
By night I will destroy thy people. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 6}Thy people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Because thou hast rejected knowledge,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I reject thee from being priest to me.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Since thou hast forgotten the instruction of thy God,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I also will forget thy children. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 7}The more they increased the more they sinned against me,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They have changed their glory for shame. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 8}They feed on the sin of my people,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they lust after their guilt. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 9}Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
But I will visit upon each punishment for his ways,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And their deeds I will requite to them. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 10}For they shall eat and not be satisfied,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They shall play the harlot and not find satisfaction,Because they have ceased to heed Jehovah. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 11}Harlotry and sweet wine take away the understanding; 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 12}My people ask counsel of their wood,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And their staff makes known to them their oracle!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
So that they have played the harlot from after their God. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 13}On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And on the hills they burn their offerings,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For their shade is pleasant!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Therefore your daughters play the harlot,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And your brides commit adultery. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 14}I will not punish your daughters because they play the harlot,  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Nor your brides because they commit adultery,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And sacrificed with consecrated prostitutes;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Thus the stupid people come to ruin! 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 15}Though thou play the harlot, Israel,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Let not Judah become guilty,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And do not come to Gilgal
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And do not go up to Beth-avem.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And do not swear at Beersheha, As Jehovah liveth. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 16}Yea, like a stubborn heifer,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Israel has behaved stubbornly,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Can Jehovah now feed him,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
As he would a lamb in a broad pasture? 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 17}Ephraim is wedded to idols; leave him alone! 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 18}A band of topers! They gave themselves up to harlotry;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They love shame more than honor. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 19}A wind-storm shall envelop them in its wings,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And they shall be ashamed of their altars.  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 5}Hear this, O priests,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 1}And hearken, O house of Israel,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And, O house of the king, give heed;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Since for you is the judgment.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 A snare have you become at Mizpeh,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And a net spread out on Tabor, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 2}And a deep pit have they dug at Shittim,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And there is no correction for any of them? 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 3}I indeed know Ephraim,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And Israel is not hid from me,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For thou, O Ephraim, hast played the harlot,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Israel is defiled. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 4}Their deeds do not permit them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
To return to their God,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For the spirit of harlotry is within them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And Jehovah they do not know. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 5}Therefore Israel\uc1\u8217*s pride shall testify to his face,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And Ephraim shall stumble through his guilt.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Judah also shall stumble with them. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 6}With their sheep and their cattle, they shall go about
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
To seek Jehovah, but shall not find him, 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 7}For they have been untrue to Jehovah,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Since they have begotten alien children;

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
A new moon may destroy them with their portions.
\par}

{\pard 
 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 8}Blow the trumpet in Gibeah,

The clarion in Ramah,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Raise the alarm in Bethel,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Make Benjamin trernble,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 9}Ephraim shall become a desolation
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
In the day of punishment,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Concerning the tribes of Israel I make known what is certain. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 10}The princes of Israel have become,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Like those who remove the landmarks;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Upon them I will pour out my wrath like water. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 11}Ephraim practises oppression and crushes right,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For he is determined to go after vanity.
\par}

{\pard 
 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 12}But I am like a moth to Ephraim,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Like rottenness to the house of Israel;  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 13}For when Ephraim saw his sickness; 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And Israel his sore,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Ephraim went to Assyria
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And Israel to the great king;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
But he cannot heal you,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Nor relieve you of your wound. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 14}For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And like a young lion to the house of Israel.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I, even I, will rend and go my way,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I will carry off and none shall rescue.

{\pard 
 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 15}I will return to my place,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Until they are confounded and seek my presence.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
When they are in distress they will quickly seek me,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\cf1 6}Saying, <<Come let us return to Jehovah,

{\super\cf2\fs24 1}For he bath torn and he will heal us,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
He hath smitten and he will bind us up,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 2}He will revive in a couple of days,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
On the third day he will raise us up again,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
That we may live in his presence.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 3}Yea, let us know, let us eagerly seek to know Jehovah,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
As soon as we quickly seek him,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Then he will come to us as the winter rain,

{\pard

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 4}What can I make of you, O Ephraim!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
What can I make of you, O Israel!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Since your love is like a morning cloud,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Yea, like the dew which early goes away. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 5}Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
I have slain themk by the words of my mouth. 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And my judgment is like the light that goes forth,  
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 6}For it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And knowledge of God and not burnt-offerings.
\par}

{\pard 
 
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 7}But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
There they have played me false.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 8}Gileadm is a city of evil-doers,

Tracked with bloody footprints,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 9}And as bandits lie in wait for a man,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem;

Verily they commit deliberate crime.

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
{\super\cf2\fs24 10}In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing,

 {\cf1 1}This message from the {\scaps {\super\cf2\fs24 1}Lord} came to Jonah, the son of Amittai: {\super\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8216*Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness is known to me.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 3}But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the {\scaps Lord}. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But the {\scaps Lord} made a furious wind blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in danger of breaking to pieces. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The sailors were terrified and each cried for help to his own god. They threw the ship\uc1\u8217*s cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The captain of the ship went and said to him, \uc1\u8216*How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think of us, so that we may not be lost.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}The sailors said to one another, \uc1\u8216*Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.\uc1\u8217* So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So they said to him, \uc1\u8216*Are you to blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}He replied, \uc1\u8216*I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the {\scaps Lord}, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, \uc1\u8216*What have you done?\uc1\u8217* For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the {\scaps Lord}, because he had told them.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Then they said to him, \uc1\u8216*What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?\uc1\u8217* For the sea grew more and more stormy. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}He said to them, \uc1\u8216*Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So they cried to the {\scaps Lord} and said, \uc1\u8216*We beg you, {\scaps Lord}, we beg you, don\uc1\u8217*t let us die for this man\uc1\u8217*s life, and don\uc1\u8217*t let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the {\scaps Lord}; you have done as it pleases you.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then the men greatly feared the {\scaps Lord}, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And when word came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}And he made this proclamation and published it in Nineveh: \uc1\u8216*By the decree of the king and his nobles: People, beast, herd, and flock shall not taste anything; let them not eat nor drink water. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and from the deeds of violence which they are doing. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Who knows?

The bush gave Jonah great pleasure; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah\uc1\u8217*s head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, \uc1\u8216*It is better for me to die than to live.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}But God said to Jonah, \uc1\u8216*Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?\uc1\u8217* He replied, \uc1\u8216*I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 33}This was another parable which Jesus related \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*The kingdom of heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 34}Of all this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all except in parables, {\super\cf2\fs24 35}in fulfilment of these words in the prophet \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world.\uc1\u8221*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}\uc1\u8216*I tell you,\uc1\u8217* answered Jesus, \uc1\u8216*that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first.  {\cf1 20}For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire labourers for his vineyards. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He agreed with the labourers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}On going out again, about nine o\uc1\u8217*clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}\uc1\u8220*You also may go into my vineyard,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*and I will pay you what is fair.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o\uc1\u8217*clock, he did as before. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them \uc1\u8220*Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}\uc1\u8220*Because no one has hired us,\uc1\u8221* they answered. \uc1\u8220*You also may go into my vineyard,\uc1\u8221* he said. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward \uc1\u8220*Call the labourers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Now when those who had been hired about five o\uc1\u8217*clock went up, they received two silver coins each. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each; {\super\cf2\fs24 11}at which they began to grumble at their employer. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}\uc1\u8220*These last,\uc1\u8221* they said, \uc1\u8220*have done only one hour\uc1\u8217*s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day\uc1\u8217*s work, and the heat.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}\uc1\u8220*My friend,\uc1\u8221* was his reply to one of them, \uc1\u8220*I am not treating you unfairly.

I choose to give to this last man the same as to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Don\uc1\u8217*t I have the right to do as I choose with what is mine?

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Afterwards, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables; {\super\cf2\fs24 11}and he said, \uc1\u8216*To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}\uc1\u8220*Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}\uc1\u8216*You do not know the meaning of this parable?\uc1\u8217* he went on, \uc1\u8216*Then how will you understand all the other parables? {\super\cf2\fs24 14}The sower sows the message. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these \uc1\u8211* where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Jesus also said, \uc1\u8216*To what can we liken the kingdom of God? {\super\cf2\fs24 31}By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 33}With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it; {\super\cf2\fs24 34}and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.

No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}shrieking out in a loud voice, \uc1\u8216*What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God\uc1\u8217*s sake do not torment me!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For Jesus had said, \uc1\u8216*Come out from the man, you foul spirit.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}And he asked him, \uc1\u8216*What is your name?\uc1\u8217* \uc1\u8216*My name,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*is Legion, for there are many of us;\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round; and the people went to see what had happened. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind \uc1\u8211* the man who had had the \uc1\u8220*Legion\uc1\u8221* in him \uc1\u8211* and they were awe-struck. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.

 {\cf1 6}On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. \uc1\u8216*Where did he get this?\uc1\u8217* they said, \uc1\u8216*and what is this wisdom that has been given him?

And aren\uc1\u8217*t his sisters, too, living here among us?\uc1\u8217* This proved a hindrance to their believing in him; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}at which Jesus said, \uc1\u8216*A prophet is not without honour, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey \uc1\u8211* not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}\uc1\u8216*Whenever you go to stay at a house,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*remain there until you leave that place; {\super\cf2\fs24 11}and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears; {\super\cf2\fs24 11}yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Afterwards, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then he said to them, \uc1\u8216*Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Moreover these signs will attend those who believe.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But the angel said to him, \uc1\u8216*Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\uc1\u8217*

 {\cf1 4}Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John {\super\cf2\fs24 2}(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized), {\super\cf2\fs24 3}he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}He had to pass through Samaria, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Jacob\uc1\u8217*s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Give me some to drink,\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}\uc1\u8216*How is it,\uc1\u8217* replied the Samaritan woman, \uc1\u8216*that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?\uc1\u8217* (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans). {\super\cf2\fs24 10}\uc1\u8216*If you knew of the gift of God,\uc1\u8217* replied Jesus, \uc1\u8216*and who it is that is saying to you \uc1\u8220*Give me some water,\uc1\u8221* you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\uc1\u8217*

Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest! {\super\cf2\fs24 36}Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}For here the proverb holds good \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*One sows, another reaps.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 38}I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labour; others have laboured, and you have reaped the results of their labour.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 39}Many from that town came to believe in Jesus \uc1\u8211* Samaritans though they were \uc1\u8211* because the woman had said, \uc1\u8220*He has told me everything that I have done.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 40}And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. {\super\cf2\fs24 41}But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself, {\super\cf2\fs24 42}and they said to the woman, \uc1\u8216*It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Saviour of the world.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee; {\super\cf2\fs24 44}for he himself declared that \uc1\u8220*a prophet is not honoured in his own country.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 45}When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present. {\super\cf2\fs24 46}So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king\uc1\u8217*s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum. {\super\cf2\fs24 47}When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death. {\super\cf2\fs24 48}Jesus answered, \uc1\u8216*Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.\uc1\u8217*

 {\cf1 5}Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades round it. It is called in Hebrew \uc1\u8220*Bethesda.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 3}In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying \uc1\u8211* blind, lame, and crippled. {\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn {\super\cf2\fs24 4}  Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}\uc1\u8216*The man who cured me,\uc1\u8217* he answered, \uc1\u8216*said to me \uc1\u8220*Take up your mat and walk.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}\uc1\u8216*Who was it,\uc1\u8217* they asked, \uc1\u8216*that said to you \uc1\u8220*Take up your mat and walk\uc1\u8221*?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Afterwards Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, \uc1\u8216*You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And that was why they began to persecute Jesus \uc1\u8211* because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}But Jesus replied, \uc1\u8216*My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father \uc1\u8211* putting himself on an equality with God.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So Jesus made this further reply, \uc1\u8216*In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things \uc1\u8211* so that you will be filled with wonder. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son, {\super\cf2\fs24 23}so that everyone may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him; {\super\cf2\fs24 27}and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice, {\super\cf2\fs24 29}and will come out \uc1\u8211* those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}\uc1\u8216*If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy; {\super\cf2\fs24 32}it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation. {\super\cf2\fs24 35}He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John\uc1\u8217*s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out \uc1\u8211* the work that I am doing \uc1\u8211* is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form; {\super\cf2\fs24 38}and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life; and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me, {\super\cf2\fs24 40}you refuse to come to me to have life.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea, {\super\cf2\fs24 17}and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum.

The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*Why was not this perfume sold for a year\uc1\u8217*s wages, and the money given to poor people?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}\uc1\u8216*Leave her alone,\uc1\u8217* said Jesus, \uc1\u8216*so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, \uc1\u8216*God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord \uc1\u8211* The king of Israel!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8220*Fear not, people of Zion; Your king is coming to you, Sitting on the foal of an ass.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 16}His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}This, indeed, was why the crowd met him \uc1\u8211* because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So the Pharisees said to one another, \uc1\u8216*You see that you are gaining nothing!

So they took Jesus; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}There they crucified him, and two others with him \uc1\u8211* one on each side, and Jesus between them. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The chief priests said to Pilate, \uc1\u8216*Do not write \uc1\u8220*The king of the Jews\uc1\u8221*, but write what the man said \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I am the king of the Jews.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But Pilate answered, \uc1\u8216*What I have written, I have written.\uc1\u8217*

{\cf1 1}The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfilment of the Father\uc1\u8217*s promise \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*that promise,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*of which you have heard me speak; {\super\cf2\fs24 5}for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}His answer was, \uc1\u8216*It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}and said, \uc1\u8216*People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

 {\cf1 2}In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}People of Israel, listen to what I am saying.

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}You have shown me the path to life,

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says \uc1\u8211*

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*The Lord said to my master, \uc1\u8216*Sit on my right hand,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.\uc1\u8217*\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ \uc1\u8211* this Jesus whom you crucified.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \uc1\u8216*Friends, what can we do?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 38}\uc1\u8216*Repent,\uc1\u8217* answered Peter, \uc1\u8216*and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 40}Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 41}So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone. {\super\cf2\fs24 42}They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 43}A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles. {\super\cf2\fs24 44}All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use; {\super\cf2\fs24 45}they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs. {\super\cf2\fs24 46}Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 47}And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.

 {\cf1 3}One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o\uc1\u8217*clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called \uc1\u8220*the Beautiful Gate,\uc1\u8221* to beg of those who went in. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, \uc1\u8216*Look at us.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}but Peter added, \uc1\u8216*I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man\uc1\u8217*s feet and ankles became strong, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}All the people saw him walking about and praising God; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and, when they recognised him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered round them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}On seeing this, Peter said to the people, \uc1\u8216*People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk? {\super\cf2\fs24 13}The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honour to his servant Jesus \uc1\u8211* him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer! {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead \uc1\u8211* and of that we are ourselves witnesses. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has \uc1\u8211* by his name \uc1\u8211* been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Moses himself said \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham \uc1\u8211*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.\uc1\u8217*  {\cf1 4}While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles\uc1\u8217* message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*By what power,\uc1\u8217* they asked, \uc1\u8216*Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, \uc1\u8216*Leaders of the people and elders, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead \uc1\u8211* it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Jesus is \uc1\u8220*the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realised that they had been companions of Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}\uc1\u8216*What are we to do to these men?\uc1\u8217* they asked one another. \uc1\u8216*That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}But Peter and John replied, \uc1\u8216*Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred; {\super\cf2\fs24 22}for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.

 {\cf1 7}Then the high priest asked, \uc1\u8216*Is this true?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Stephen replied, \uc1\u8216*Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8220*Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father\uc1\u8217*s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}God\uc1\u8217*s words were these \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Abraham\uc1\u8217*s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,\uc1\u8221* God said, \uc1\u8220*and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favour and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}As the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt, {\super\cf2\fs24 18}until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father\uc1\u8217*s house; {\super\cf2\fs24 21}and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites; {\super\cf2\fs24 24}and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. \uc1\u8220*Men,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 27}But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Who made you a ruler and judge over us? {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 29}At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush. {\super\cf2\fs24 31}When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 32}\uc1\u8220*I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\uc1\u8221* Moses trembled, and did not dare to look. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}Then the Lord said to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 35}This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Who made you a ruler and a judge?\uc1\u8221* was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 38}He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt, {\super\cf2\fs24 40}while they said to Aaron \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Make us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 41}That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honour of their own handiwork! {\super\cf2\fs24 42}So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets \uc1\u8211*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and many who were paralysed or lame were cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. \uc1\u8220*This man,\uc1\u8221* they used to say, \uc1\u8220*must be that power of God which people call \uc1\u8216*The Great Power.\uc1\u8217*\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God\uc1\u8217*s message, they sent Peter and John to them; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}(As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus). {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}\uc1\u8216*Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,\uc1\u8217* Simon answered, \uc1\u8216*so that none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they went, in many Samaritan villages.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 34}\uc1\u8216*Now,\uc1\u8217* said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, \uc1\u8216*tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 35}Then Philip began, and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about Jesus.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, \uc1\u8216*Look!

 {\cf1 9}Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorising him, if he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\uc1\u8217*

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said, \uc1\u8216*Ananias.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Yes, Lord,\uc1\u8217* he answered. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}\uc1\u8216*Go at once,\uc1\u8217* said the Lord, \uc1\u8216*to the Straight Street, and ask at Judas\uc1\u8217*s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}\uc1\u8216*Lord,\uc1\u8217* exclaimed Ananias, \uc1\u8216*I have heard from many people about this man \uc1\u8211* how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}But the Lord said to him, \uc1\u8216*Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said, \uc1\u8216*Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord \uc1\u8211* by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here \uc1\u8211* so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul\uc1\u8217*s eyes, and his sight was restored.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}All who heard him were amazed.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Is not this,\uc1\u8217* they asked, \uc1\u8216*the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Saul\uc1\u8217*s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul, {\super\cf2\fs24 24}but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him; {\super\cf2\fs24 25}but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord, {\super\cf2\fs24 29}talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}\uc1\u8216*Aeneas,\uc1\u8217* Peter said to him, \uc1\u8216*Jesus Christ cures you.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 36}At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek \uc1\u8220*Dorcas\uc1\u8221* \uc1\u8211* a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room. {\super\cf2\fs24 38}Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came round him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them. {\super\cf2\fs24 40}But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed.

She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up. {\super\cf2\fs24 41}Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ\uc1\u8217*s people, presented her to them alive. {\super\cf2\fs24 42}This became known all through Jaffa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 43}And Peter stayed some days at Jaffa with a tanner named Simon.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then he was aware of a voice which said \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon\uc1\u8217*s house, came up to the gate, {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, \uc1\u8216*There are two men looking for you at this moment. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}\uc1\u8216*You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*I see, beyond all doubt,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*that God does not show partiality, {\super\cf2\fs24 35}but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace \uc1\u8211* and Jesus is Lord of all! {\super\cf2\fs24 37}You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning form Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 38}The story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross! {\super\cf2\fs24 40}This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear, {\super\cf2\fs24 41}not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God \uc1\u8211* to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 42}Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 43}To him it is that all the prophets bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives through his name forgiveness of sins.\uc1\u8217*

 {\cf1 11}The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God\uc1\u8217*s message. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}on the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had taken meals with them. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}So Peter began to relate the facts to them as they had occurred. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*I was in the town of Jaffa,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*and was praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the heavens; and it came right down to me. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Looking intently at it, I began to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and I also heard a voice saying to me \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}\uc1\u8220*No, Lord, I cannot,\uc1\u8221* I answered, \uc1\u8220*for nothing defiled or unclean has ever passed my lips.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Then a second time there came a voice from the heavens. \uc1\u8220*What God has pronounced clean\uc1\u8221*, it said, \uc1\u8220*you must not call defiled.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}At that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also went with me. And, when we came into the man\uc1\u8217*s house, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Send to Jaffa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to you and all your household.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}I had but just begun to speak,\uc1\u8217* continued Peter, \uc1\u8216*when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the first; {\super\cf2\fs24 16}and I recalled the saying of the Master \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master \uc1\u8211* who was I that I could thwart God?\uc1\u8217*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message \uc1\u8211* but only to Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord\uc1\u8217*s side. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}On coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to the Lord \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 24}For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith \uc1\u8211* and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord\uc1\u8217*s side. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Afterwards Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul; {\super\cf2\fs24 26}and, when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}One of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world \uc1\u8211* a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}So the disciples, without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send something to help the followers living in Judea. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}And this they did, sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul.

 {\cf1 12}It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the members of the church. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He had James, the brother of John, beheaded; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and, when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.) {\super\cf2\fs24 4}After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the Passover, to bring him up before the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So Peter was kept in prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly offered to God on his behalf. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Just when Herod was intending to bring him before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of the door, guarding the prison. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side, and roused him with the words, \uc1\u8216*Get up quickly.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The chains dropped from his wrists, and then the angel said, \uc1\u8216*Put on your belt and sandals.\uc1\u8217* When Peter had done so, the angel added, \uc1\u8216*Throw your cloak round you and follow me.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under the angel\uc1\u8217*s guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once the angel left him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Then Peter came to himself and said, \uc1\u8216*Now I know beyond all doubt that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod\uc1\u8217*s hands and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}As soon as he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered together, praying. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}On his knocking at the door in the gate, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}She recognized Peter\uc1\u8217*s voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them that Peter was standing outside.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Peter signed to them with his hand to be silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, adding, \uc1\u8216*Tell James and the others all this.\uc1\u8217* Then he left the house, and went away to another place.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers \uc1\u8211* what could have become of Peter! {\super\cf2\fs24 19}And, when Herod had made further search for him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at Caesarea.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king\uc1\u8217*s for its food supply. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes, seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}The people kept shouting, \uc1\u8216*It is the voice of God, and not of a person!\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720

\uc1\u8216*People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to say. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}For about forty years he bore with them in the desert; {\super\cf2\fs24 19}then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}For about four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of whom the prophet Samuel was the last. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}And, when they demanded a king, God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}After removing him, he raised David to the throne, and bore this testimony to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*In David, the son of Jesse, I have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my purposes.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}It was from this man\uc1\u8217*s descendants that God, in accordance with his promise, gave Israel a Saviour \uc1\u8211* Jesus; {\super\cf2\fs24 24}John having first proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for all the people of Israel. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}As John was drawing towards the end of his career, he said \uc1\u8220*What do you suppose that I am?

 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But, when the disciples had gathered round him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}After telling the good news throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, {\super\cf2\fs24 22}reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}They also appointed elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia, {\super\cf2\fs24 25}and, after telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}From there they sailed to Antioch \uc1\u8211* the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}After their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith; {\super\cf2\fs24 28}and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time.

 {\cf1 15}But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Some of the Pharisees\uc1\u8217* party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}After much discussion, Peter rose and said:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out \uc1\u8211* that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear? {\super\cf2\fs24 11}No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Friends,\uc1\u8217* he began, \uc1\u8216*hear what I have to say. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his name. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}\uc1\u8220*After this I will return;

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Its ruins I will rebuild,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}That so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord \uc1\u8211*

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}They were bearers of the following letter \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds \uc1\u8211* without instructions from us \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 25}We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, {\super\cf2\fs24 26}who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 29}That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them. {\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn {\super\cf2\fs24 34}  Some later manuscripts add: But Silas decided to stay. }
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, \uc1\u8216*Let us go back and visit the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message, and see how they are prospering.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 37}Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark; {\super\cf2\fs24 38}but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus, {\super\cf2\fs24 40}while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord, {\super\cf2\fs24 41}started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 16}Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and who was well spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and there one night Paul saw a vision. A Macedonian was standing and appealing to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Come over to Macedonia and help us.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had summoned us to tell the good news to the people there.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}From there we made our way to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and also a Roman Settlement.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
In that city we spent several days. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman\uc1\u8217*s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and, when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us to become her guests.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Since you have shown your conviction,\uc1\u8217* she said, \uc1\u8216*that I really am a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.\uc1\u8217* And she insisted on our doing so.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her masters by fortune-telling. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, calling, \uc1\u8216*These men are servants of the most high God, and they are bringing you news of a way to salvation.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her, \uc1\u8216*In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.\uc1\u8217* That very moment the spirit left her.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and took them before the Magistrates.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,\uc1\u8217* they complained; {\super\cf2\fs24 21}\uc1\u8216*They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}On receiving so strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured their feet in the stocks. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening to them, {\super\cf2\fs24 26}suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the prisoners\uc1\u8217* chains were loosened. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Roused from his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}But Paul called our loudly, \uc1\u8216*Do not harm yourself; we are all here.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Then he led them out, and said, \uc1\u8216*What must I do to be saved?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}\uc1\u8216*Believe in Jesus, our Lord,\uc1\u8217* they replied, \uc1\u8216*and you will be saved, you and your household too.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Then they spoke to him of God\uc1\u8217*s message, and to all his household as well. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}And that very hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging to him were baptized without delay. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}Afterwards he took them up to his house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all his household, had come to believe in God.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}In the morning the Magistrates sent the police with an order for the men to be discharged. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}The jailer told Paul of his instructions. \uc1\u8216*The Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*so you had better leave the place at once and go quietly away.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 37}But Paul\uc1\u8217*s answer to them was, \uc1\u8216*They have flogged us in public without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let them come and take us out themselves.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 38}The police reported his words to the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, were alarmed, {\super\cf2\fs24 39}and went to the prison, and did their best to conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the city. {\super\cf2\fs24 40}When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia\uc1\u8217*s house, and, after they had seen the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers, and encouraged them, they left the place.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 17}After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue; {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and \uc1\u8216*It is this man,\uc1\u8217* he declared, \uc1\u8216*who is the Christ \uc1\u8211* this Jesus about whom I am telling you.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason\uc1\u8217*s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers before the city magistrates, shouting out,
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and have been harboured by Jason! They are all defying the decrees of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king \uc1\u8211* a man called Jesus!\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God\uc1\u8217*s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked \uc1\u8216*What is this prater wanting to make out?\uc1\u8217*, while others said \uc1\u8216*He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.\uc1\u8217* (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection). {\super\cf2\fs24 19}So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*May we hear,\uc1\u8217* they asked, \uc1\u8216*what new teaching this is which you are giving? {\super\cf2\fs24 20}For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*To an Unknown God.\uc1\u8221* What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}The God who made the world and all things that are in it \uc1\u8211* he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands, {\super\cf2\fs24 25}neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}He made all races of the earth\uc1\u8217*s surface \uc1\u8211* fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 27}That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us; {\super\cf2\fs24 28}for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*His offspring, too, are we.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone \uc1\u8211* a work of human art and imagination. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people\uc1\u8217*s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed \uc1\u8211* and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 32}On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}And so Paul left the Court. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 18}On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them \uc1\u8211* their trade was tent-making. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, \uc1\u8216*Your blood be on your own heads.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision, \uc1\u8216*Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God\uc1\u8217*s message among the people.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor\uc1\u8217*s Bench, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, \uc1\u8216*If this were a case of misdemeanour or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however, {\super\cf2\fs24 21}as he took his leave, \uc1\u8216*I will come back again to you, please God,\uc1\u8217* and then set sail from Ephesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John\uc1\u8217*s. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 19}While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8216*Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*No,\uc1\u8217* they answered, \uc1\u8216*we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8216*What then was your baptism?\uc1\u8217* Paul asked. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}\uc1\u8216*John\uc1\u8217*s baptism was a baptism on repentance,\uc1\u8217* rejoined Paul, \uc1\u8216*and John told the people (speaking of the \uc1\u8220*one coming\uc1\u8221* after him) that they should believe in him \uc1\u8211* that is in Jesus.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}On hearing this, they were baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}There were about twelve of them in all.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul\uc1\u8217*s hands; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*I order you,\uc1\u8217* they would say, \uc1\u8216*by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}but the wicked spirit answered them, \uc1\u8216*Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you \uc1\u8211* who are you?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them, mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honour. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices; {\super\cf2\fs24 19}while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}So irresistibly did the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message spread and prevail.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. \uc1\u8216*And after I have been there,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*I must visit Rome also.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}So he sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Roman Asia.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans, {\super\cf2\fs24 25}got these men together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and said:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work, {\super\cf2\fs24 26}and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at all. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendour \uc1\u8211* though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 29}The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul\uc1\u8217*s traveling companions. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Paul wished to go into the amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself inside. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing why they had met. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to show that he wanted to speak in their defence to the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}However, when they recognised him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they continued shouting for two hours \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 35}When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said, \uc1\u8216*People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis, and of the statue which fell down from Zeus? {\super\cf2\fs24 36}As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash; {\super\cf2\fs24 37}for you have brought these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor blasphemers of our Goddess. {\super\cf2\fs24 38}If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal proceedings. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled in the regular Assembly. {\super\cf2\fs24 40}For I tell you that we are in danger of being proceeded against for today\uc1\u8217*s riot, there being nothing to account for it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this disorderly gathering.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 20}When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with encouraging words, bade them goodbye, and started on his journey to Macedonia. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}After going through those districts and speaking many encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed three months. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he decided to return by way of Macedonia. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of Roman Asia. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}These people went to Troas and waited for us there; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}while we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}There were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked up for dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms round him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Do not be alarmed,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*he is still alive.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Then he went upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with them at great length until daybreak, and then left. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Meanwhile they had taken the lad away alive, and were greatly comforted.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement, as he intended to go by land himself. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}So, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The day after we had sailed from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day, and the next day reached Miletus; {\super\cf2\fs24 16}for Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of the Harvest.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church elders to meet him; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and, when they came, he said to them, \uc1\u8216*You know well the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set foot in Roman Asia, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of the Jewish leaders. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}I never shrank from telling you anything that could be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}I earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And now, under spiritual constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, {\super\cf2\fs24 23}except that in town after town the Holy Spirit plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}But I count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus \uc1\u8211* which was to declare the good news of the love of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}And now, I tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again \uc1\u8211* you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}Therefore I declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the fate of any of you, {\super\cf2\fs24 27}for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole purpose of God regarding you. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Be watchful over yourselves, and over the whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his life. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock; {\super\cf2\fs24 30}and from among yourselves, too, people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw away the disciples after them. {\super\cf2\fs24 31}Therefore, be on your guard, remembering how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to warn each one of you. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}And now I commend you to the Lord and to the message of his love \uc1\u8211* a message which has the power to build up your characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become Christ\uc1\u8217*s people. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}I have never coveted anyone\uc1\u8217*s gold or silver or clothing. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not only for my own wants, but for my companions also. {\super\cf2\fs24 35}I left nothing undone to show you that, labouring as I laboured, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*It is more blessed to give than to receive.\uc1\u8221*\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 36}When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}All were in tears; and throwing their arms round Paul\uc1\u8217*s neck, they kissed him again and again, {\super\cf2\fs24 38}grieving most of all over what he had said \uc1\u8211* that they would never see his face again.

Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*You see, brother, that those of our people who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 40}The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew:  {\cf1 22}\uc1\u8216*Brothers and fathers, listen to the defence which I am about to make.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8216*I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God\uc1\u8217*s service as any of you who are here today. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all round me. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me \uc1\u8220*Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}\uc1\u8220*Who are you, Lord?\uc1\u8221* I replied. Then the voice said \uc1\u8220*I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker\uc1\u8217*s voice. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then I said \uc1\u8220*What am I to do, Lord?\uc1\u8221* \uc1\u8220*Get up and go into Damascus,\uc1\u8221* The Lord said to me, \uc1\u8220*and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Standing close to me, he said \uc1\u8220*Saul, my brother, recover your sight.\uc1\u8221* And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Then he said \uc1\u8220*The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And now why wait any longer, Be baptized at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 17}After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance, {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and saw Jesus saying to me \uc1\u8220*Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 19}\uc1\u8220*Lord,\uc1\u8221* I answered, \uc1\u8220*these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you; {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}But Jesus said to me \uc1\u8220*Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away\uc1\u8221*.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, \uc1\u8216*Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air, {\super\cf2\fs24 24}the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the captain standing near, \uc1\u8216*Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 26}On hearing this, the captain went and reported it to the commanding officer. \uc1\u8216*Do you know what you are doing?\uc1\u8217* he said. \uc1\u8216*This man is a Roman citizen.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 27}So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, \uc1\u8216*Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Yes,\uc1\u8217* replied Paul. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}\uc1\u8216*I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,\uc1\u8217* said the officer. \uc1\u8216*I am one by birth,\uc1\u8217* rejoined Paul.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains.

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 30}On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them.  {\cf1 23}Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
{\super\cf2\fs24 1}\uc1\u8216*Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Paul turned to him and said:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The people standing near said to Paul, \uc1\u8216*Do you know that you are insulting God\uc1\u8217*s high priest?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,\uc1\u8217* said Paul, \uc1\u8216*for scripture says \uc1\u8211*
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8220*Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill\uc1\u8221*.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, \uc1\u8216*Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}(For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.) {\super\cf2\fs24 9}So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law belonging to the Pharisees\uc1\u8217* party stood up and hotly protested, \uc1\u8216*We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel\uc1\u8230*\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said, \uc1\u8216*Courage! You have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome also.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}There were more than forty in the plot; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and they went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, \uc1\u8216*We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}However, the son of Paul\uc1\u8217*s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Paul called one of the Captains of the garrison and asked him to take the lad to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}The captain went with the lad to the commanding officer, and said, \uc1\u8216*The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this lad to you, as he has something to tell you.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}The commanding officer took the lad by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}\uc1\u8216*Some men have agreed,\uc1\u8217* answered the lad, \uc1\u8216*to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o\uc1\u8217*clock that night, {\super\cf2\fs24 24}and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}He also wrote a letter along these lines:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}\uc1\u8220*Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the Governor. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council, {\super\cf2\fs24 29}when I found that their charges were connected with questions of their own Law, and that there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 31}The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris; {\super\cf2\fs24 32}and on the next day, leaving the troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}On arriving at Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought Paul before him. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he said, {\super\cf2\fs24 35}\uc1\u8216*I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have arrived.\uc1\u8217* And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod\uc1\u8217*s Government house.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 24}Five days afterwards the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul; {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and, when the hearing came on, Tertullus began his speech for the prosecution. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8216*We owe it to your Excellency,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms \uc1\u8211* advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But \uc1\u8211* not to be tedious \uc1\u8211* I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a brief statement of our case. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}We have found this man a public pest; he is one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a ringleader of the Nazarene heretics. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}He even attempted to desecrate the Temple itself, but we caught him; {\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn {\super\cf2\fs24 7}  Some later manuscripts add: We wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias the commanding officer came and took him out of our hands by force, ordering his accusers to come before you. } {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and you will be able, by examining him on all these points, to satisfy yourself as to the charges which we are bringing against him.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his statements. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply:
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defence. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}where my prosecutors never found me holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect \uc1\u8211* either in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city; {\super\cf2\fs24 13}and they cannot establish the charges which they are now making against me. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets; {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and I have a hope that rests in God \uc1\u8211* a hope which they also cherish \uc1\u8211* that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}This being so, I strive at all times to keep my conscience clear before both God and people. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}After some years\uc1\u8217* absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Or else let my opponents here say what they found wrong in me when I was before the Council, {\super\cf2\fs24 21}except as to the one sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today\uc1\u8221*.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Felix, however, adjourned the case \uc1\u8211* though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way \uc1\u8211* with the promise, \uc1\u8216*When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So he gave orders to the captain in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}But, while Paul was speaking at length about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified, and interrupted him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Go for the present, but, when I find an opportunity, I will send for you again.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 26}He was hoping, too, for a bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with him. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left Paul a prisoner.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 25}Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}There the chief priests and the leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and asked a favour of him, to Paul\uc1\u8217*s injury \uc1\u8211* to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the road. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}\uc1\u8216*So let the influential men among you,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 6}After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}On Paul\uc1\u8217*s appearance, the Jewish leaders who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious charges, which they failed to establish. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Paul\uc1\u8217*s answer to the charge was \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I have not committed any offence against the Jewish Law, or the Temple, or the Emperor.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 9}But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, \uc1\u8216*Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}\uc1\u8216*No,\uc1\u8217* replied Paul, \uc1\u8216*I am standing at the Emperor\uc1\u8217*s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offence deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, \uc1\u8216*You have appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and paid a visit of congratulation to Festus; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul\uc1\u8217*s case before the king. \uc1\u8216*There is a man here,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*left a prisoner by Felix, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an information, demanding judgment against him. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected; {\super\cf2\fs24 19}but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}\uc1\u8216*I should like to hear this man myself,\uc1\u8217* Agrippa said to Festus.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*You will hear him tomorrow,\uc1\u8217* Festus answered.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought before them. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Then Festus said, \uc1\u8216*King Agrippa, and all here present, you see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to be allowed to live. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}I found, however, that he had not done anything deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I decided to send him. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}But I have nothing definite to write about him to my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him, I may have something to write. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against him.\uc1\u8217* 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 26}Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, \uc1\u8216*You are at liberty to speak for yourself.\uc1\u8217* Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defence. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8216*I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*that it is before you that I have to make my defence today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews; {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and they have always known \uc1\u8211* if they choose to give evidence \uc1\u8211* that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused \uc1\u8211* and by Jews themselves! {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead? {\super\cf2\fs24 9}I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all round me and those traveling with me. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8220*Who are you, Lord?\uc1\u8221* I asked. And the Lord said, \uc1\u8220*I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; {\super\cf2\fs24 16}but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you, {\super\cf2\fs24 17}since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, {\super\cf2\fs24 18}to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God\uc1\u8217*s people, by faith in me.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 19}After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision; {\super\cf2\fs24 20}on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike \uc1\u8211* without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}While Paul was making this defence, Festus called out loudly, \uc1\u8216*You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 25}\uc1\u8216*I am not mad, your Excellency,\uc1\u8217* he replied. \uc1\u8216*On the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 28}But Agrippa said to Paul, \uc1\u8216*You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 29}\uc1\u8216*Whether it is soon or late,\uc1\u8217* answered Paul, \uc1\u8216*I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself \uc1\u8211* except for these chains!\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. \uc1\u8216*There is nothing,\uc1\u8217* they said, \uc1\u8216*deserving death or imprisonment in this man\uc1\u8217*s conduct\uc1\u8217*; {\super\cf2\fs24 32}and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, \uc1\u8216*The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.\uc1\u8217*

 {\cf1 27}As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us; {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavourable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called \uc1\u8220*Fair Havens,\uc1\u8221* near which was the town of Lasea.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}\uc1\u8216*My friends,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.\uc1\u8217*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And, as the harbour was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favour of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbour, open to the north-east and south-east. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}But shortly afterwards a hurricane came down on us off the land \uc1\u8211* a north-easter, as it is called. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship\uc1\u8217*s boat, {\super\cf2\fs24 17}and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}and, on the following day, threw out the ship\uc1\u8217*s tackle with their own hands. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said, \uc1\u8216*My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Yet, even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you \uc1\u8211* only the ship. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 24}\uc1\u8220*Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Therefore, courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}We will, however, have to be driven on some island.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretence of running out anchors from the bows, {\super\cf2\fs24 31}when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, \uc1\u8216*Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 32}So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away. {\super\cf2\fs24 33}In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
\uc1\u8216*It is a fortnight today,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing. {\super\cf2\fs24 34}So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 35}With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat; {\super\cf2\fs24 36}and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 37}There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told. {\super\cf2\fs24 38}After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. {\super\cf2\fs24 39}When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it. {\super\cf2\fs24 40}Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach. {\super\cf2\fs24 41}They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain. {\super\cf2\fs24 42}The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape. {\super\cf2\fs24 43}But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore; {\super\cf2\fs24 44}and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.

 {\cf1 28}When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The island\uc1\u8217*s people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, \uc1\u8216*Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius.

So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God\uc1\u8217*s good news. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And among these nations are you \uc1\u8211* you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ\uc1\u8217*s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
\par}

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other\uc1\u8217*s faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you \uc1\u8211* but until now I have been prevented \uc1\u8211* that I might find among you some fruit of my labours, as I have already among the other nations.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Faith the Ground of Acceptance

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Through faith the righteous will find life.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}For ever since the creation of the universe God\uc1\u8217*s invisible attributes \uc1\u8211* his everlasting power and divinity \uc1\u8211* are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse; {\super\cf2\fs24 21}because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools; {\super\cf2\fs24 23}and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonoured their own bodies; {\super\cf2\fs24 25}for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural; {\super\cf2\fs24 27}while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.
\par}

After his circumcision or before it? {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision \uc1\u8211* to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man \uc1\u8211* in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}as well as father of the circumcised \uc1\u8211* to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing! {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God\uc1\u8217*s gift, and in order that the fulfilment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham\uc1\u8217*s descendants \uc1\u8211* not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}as scripture says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I have made you the Father of many nations.\uc1\u8221*) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfilment of the words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*So many will your descendants be,\uc1\u8221* he might become \uc1\u8220*the Father of many nations.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}He was not led by want of faith to doubt God\uc1\u8217*s promise. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And therefore his faith \uc1\u8220*was regarded as righteousness.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Now these words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*it was regarded as righteousness\uc1\u8221* \uc1\u8211* were not written with reference to Abraham only; {\super\cf2\fs24 24}but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead; {\super\cf2\fs24 25}for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offences, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 5}Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God\uc1\u8217*s favour in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God\uc1\u8217*s glorious ideal. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God\uc1\u8217*s good time, died on behalf of the godless. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For if, when we were God\uc1\u8217*s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ\uc1\u8217*s life. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam\uc1\u8217*s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}But there is a contrast between Adam\uc1\u8217*s offence and God\uc1\u8217*s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offence of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man\uc1\u8217*s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man\uc1\u8217*s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God\uc1\u8217*s gracious gift, which followed on many offences, resulted in a decree of righteousness. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For if, by reason of the offence of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Briefly then, just as a single offence resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Law was introduced in order that offences might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more, {\super\cf2\fs24 21}in order than, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Difficulties arising from this Teaching

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 6}What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness may be multiplied? {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it? {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death? {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father\uc1\u8217*s power, so we also may live a new life. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}We recognise the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ\uc1\u8217*s death, we will also share his life. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}So let it be with you \uc1\u8211* regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid! {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Surely you know that, when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service sin which leads to death, or a service Duty which leads to righteousness. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 7}Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}If, then, during her husband\uc1\u8217*s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.

If the Law did not say \uc1\u8220*You must not covet,\uc1\u8221* I should not know what it is to covet. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the Commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died! {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The Commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death! {\super\cf2\fs24 11}sin took advantage of the Commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And so the Law is holy, and each Commandment is also holy, and just, and good. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the Commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly \uc1\u8211* sold into slavery to sin. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}I know that there is nothing good in me \uc1\u8211* I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do \uc1\u8211* that I habitually do. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}This, then, is the law that I find \uc1\u8211* when I want to do right, wrong presents itself! {\super\cf2\fs24 22}At heart I delight in the Law of God; {\super\cf2\fs24 23}but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavours to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death? {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord!

 {\cf1 8}There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus; {\super\cf2\fs24 2}for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}They who are earthly cannot please God. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you.

Who has ever become his counsellor? {\super\cf2\fs24 35}Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward? {\super\cf2\fs24 36}For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.

 {\cf1 12}I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God\uc1\u8217*s will is \uc1\u8211* all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}In fulfilment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly \uc1\u8211* in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}In the love of the community of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another; {\super\cf2\fs24 11}never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer; {\super\cf2\fs24 13}relieving the wants of Christ\uc1\u8217*s people; devoted to hospitality. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Bless your persecutors \uc1\u8211* bless and never curse. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognise as honourable. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*\uc1\u8216*It is for me to avenge, I will requite,\uc1\u8217* says the Lord.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Rather \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.

 {\cf1 13}Let everyone obey the supreme Authorities. For no Authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing Authorities have been appointed by God. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Therefore he who sets himself against the authorities is resisting God\uc1\u8217*s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For they are God\uc1\u8217*s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God\uc1\u8217*s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God\uc1\u8217*s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God\uc1\u8217*s officers, devoting themselves to this special work. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In all cases pay what is due from you \uc1\u8211* tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honour where honour is due.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbour have satisfied the Law. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The commandments, \uc1\u8220*You must not commit adultery, You must not kill, You must not steal, You must not covet,\uc1\u8221* and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*You must love your neighbour as you love yourself.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Love never wrongs a neighbour. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us have done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 14}As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}One person\uc1\u8217*s faith permits of their eating food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master\uc1\u8217*s honour. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master\uc1\u8217*s honour, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master\uc1\u8217*s honour, and also gives thanks to God. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this \uc1\u8211* that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}I would ask the one \uc1\u8220*Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?\uc1\u8221* And I would ask the other \uc1\u8220*Why do you despise them?\uc1\u8221* For we will all stand before the court of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For scripture says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*\uc1\u8216*As surely as I live,\uc1\u8217* says the Lord, \uc1\u8216*every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.\uc1\u8217*\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve \uc1\u8211* never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is \uc1\u8220*defiling\uc1\u8221* only to the person who holds it to be so. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower\uc1\u8217*s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died! {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Do not undo God\uc1\u8217*s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is \uc1\u8220*clean,\uc1\u8221* yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}As for yourself \uc1\u8211* keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right! {\super\cf2\fs24 23}The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.

 {\cf1 15}We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Let each of us please our neighbour for our neighbour\uc1\u8217*s good, to help in the building up of their character. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God\uc1\u8217*s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfil the promises made to our ancestors, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honour of your name.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}And again it says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God\uc1\u8217*s people.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And yet again \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Again, Isaiah says \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 13}May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ\uc1\u8217*s people there. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ\uc1\u8217*s people at Jerusalem. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}When I have settled this matter, and have secured to the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.

But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then \uc1\u8211* face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure \uc1\u8211* these three, but the greatest of these is love.  {\cf1 14}Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues\uc1\u8221* is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Those who, when speaking, use the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues\uc1\u8221* builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Now I want you all to speak in \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching? {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognised? {\super\cf2\fs24 8}If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle? {\super\cf2\fs24 9}And so with you; unless, in using the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds! {\super\cf2\fs24 10}There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues\uc1\u8221* should pray for ability to interpret them. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}If, when praying, I use the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this \uc1\u8211* I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say \uc1\u8220*Amen\uc1\u8221* to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying! {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Thank God, I use the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues\uc1\u8221* more than any of you. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues.\uc1\u8221*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Therefore the gift of the \uc1\u8220*tongues\uc1\u8221* is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad? {\super\cf2\fs24 24}While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all; {\super\cf2\fs24 25}the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare \uc1\u8220*God is indeed among you!\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 26}What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}If any of you use the gift of \uc1\u8220*tongues,\uc1\u8221* not more than two, or at the most three, should do so \uc1\u8211* each speaking in his turn \uc1\u8211* and someone should interpret them. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop. {\super\cf2\fs24 31}For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers\uc1\u8217* control; {\super\cf2\fs24 33}for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.)

 {\super\cf2\fs24 34}At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs. {\super\cf2\fs24 35}If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church. {\super\cf2\fs24 36}What!

 {\cf1 15}Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received \uc1\u8211* the good news on which you have taken your stand, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received \uc1\u8211* that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold), {\super\cf2\fs24 4}that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold), {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of \uc1\u8220*apostle,\uc1\u8221* because I persecuted the church of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead? {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also! {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise! {\super\cf2\fs24 16}For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised, {\super\cf2\fs24 17}and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly \uc1\u8211* your sins are on you still! {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished! {\super\cf2\fs24 19}If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}But each in their proper order \uc1\u8211* Christ the first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Then will come the end \uc1\u8211* when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}For he must reign until God \uc1\u8220*has put all his enemies under his feet.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 26}The last enemy to be overthrown is death; {\super\cf2\fs24 27}for God has placed all things under Christ\uc1\u8217*s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.) {\super\cf2\fs24 28}And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all! {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf? {\super\cf2\fs24 30}Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour? {\super\cf2\fs24 31}Daily I face death \uc1\u8211* I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die! {\super\cf2\fs24 33}Do not be deceived.

Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful; {\super\cf2\fs24 43}sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body. {\super\cf2\fs24 44}As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body. {\super\cf2\fs24 45}That is what is meant by the words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Adam, the first man, became a human being\uc1\u8221*; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 46}That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual; {\super\cf2\fs24 47}the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 48}Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 49}And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 50}This I say, friends \uc1\u8211* Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable. {\super\cf2\fs24 51}Listen, I will tell you God\uc1\u8217*s hidden purpose!

Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory? {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness! {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!

Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.

No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.  {\cf1 5}For we know that if our tent \uc1\u8211* that earthly body which is now our home \uc1\u8211* is taken down, we have a house of God\uc1\u8217*s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have; {\super\cf2\fs24 17}for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}We are sending with him one of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches; {\super\cf2\fs24 19}and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honour of the Lord, and to show our deep interest. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund; {\super\cf2\fs24 21}for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honour to Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}Show them, therefore \uc1\u8211* so that the churches may see it \uc1\u8211* the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.

I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we \uc1\u8211* to say nothing of you \uc1\u8211* should feel ashamed of our present confidence. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.

 {\cf1 10}Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ \uc1\u8211* I who, \uc1\u8216*in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you\uc1\u8217* \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}I implore you not to drive me to \uc1\u8216*show my boldness,\uc1\u8217* when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact \uc1\u8211* that we belong to Christ no less than he does. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority \uc1\u8211* which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it \uc1\u8211* still I have no reason to be ashamed. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}I say this so that it doesn\uc1\u8217*t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For people say \uc1\u8216*His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Let such a person be assured of this \uc1\u8211* that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ! {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labours of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased \uc1\u8211* though still confined to our sphere \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 16}So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.

I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Why?

Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number.

I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Who is weak without my being weak?

But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvellous character of the revelations. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh \uc1\u8211* an instrument of Satan to discipline me \uc1\u8211* so that I should not think too highly of myself. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}But his reply has been \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.\uc1\u8221*

Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you?

I am afraid that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.

There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognise this fact about yourselves \uc1\u8211* that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test! {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But I hope that you will recognise that we can stand the test. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me \uc1\u8211* and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}To take an illustration, friends, from daily life \uc1\u8211* No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, \uc1\u8220*and to his offspring.\uc1\u8221* It was not said \uc1\u8220*to his offsprings,\uc1\u8221* as if many persons were meant, but the words were \uc1\u8220*to your offspring,\uc1\u8221* showing that one person was meant \uc1\u8211* and that was Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}My point is this \uc1\u8211* An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law?

 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ\uc1\u8217*s people, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realise the hope given by God\uc1\u8217*s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ\uc1\u8217*s people, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and \uc1\u8220*caused him to sit at his right hand\uc1\u8221* on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank, {\super\cf2\fs24 21}and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And God placed all things under Christ\uc1\u8217*s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head; {\super\cf2\fs24 23}for the church is Christ\uc1\u8217*s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.  {\cf1 2}You yourselves were once dead because of your offences and sins. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air \uc1\u8211* the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}even though we were dead because of our offences, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness you have been saved.) {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For it is by God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God\uc1\u8217*s. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For we are God\uc1\u8217*s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.

He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them \uc1\u8211* the Law with its injunctions and ordinances \uc1\u8211* in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ\uc1\u8217*s people and members of God\uc1\u8217*s Household. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the corner-stone. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.

Do not let the sun go down on your anger; {\super\cf2\fs24 27}and give no opportunity to the devil. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}And do not grieve God\uc1\u8217*s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption. {\super\cf2\fs24 31}Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice. {\super\cf2\fs24 32}Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.  {\cf1 5}Therefore imitate God, as his dear children, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.

Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}And this will fulfil my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honoured in my body, whether by my life or by my death, {\super\cf2\fs24 21}for to me life is Christ, and death is gain. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But what if the life here in the body \uc1\u8211* if this brings me fruit from my labours? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way! {\super\cf2\fs24 23}My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith; {\super\cf2\fs24 26}so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation \uc1\u8211* a sign from God. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.

 {\cf1 2}If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}I entreat you to make my happiness complete \uc1\u8211* Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death \uc1\u8211* to death on a cross! {\super\cf2\fs24 9}And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD \uc1\u8211* to the glory of God the Father. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension, {\super\cf2\fs24 15}so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent \uc1\u8211* faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and you must also rejoice and share my joy. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}For I have no one but him to send \uc1\u8211* no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honour. {\super\cf2\fs24 30}For it was owing to his devotion to the Master\uc1\u8217*s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves! {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For it is we who are the circumcised \uc1\u8211* we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I! {\super\cf2\fs24 5}I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ\uc1\u8217*s sake, come to count as loss. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as refuse, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him; {\super\cf2\fs24 9}any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ \uc1\u8211* the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do \uc1\u8211* forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front, {\super\cf2\fs24 14}I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}For there are many \uc1\u8211* of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears \uc1\u8211* who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a saviour to come, the Lord Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 4}So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see \uc1\u8211* you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat \uc1\u8211* All joy be yours. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honourable, righteous or pure, loveable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honour have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated \uc1\u8211* into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong! {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news \uc1\u8211* at the time when I had just left Macedonia \uc1\u8211* no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me \uc1\u8211* the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers who are with me send your their greetings. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}All Christ\uc1\u8217*s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor\uc1\u8217*s household, send theirs.

Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.

He was before all things, and all things unite in him; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The first-born from the dead, he is to the church the Source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ\uc1\u8217*s blood offered on the cross) \uc1\u8211* whether on earth or in heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 22}But now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ\uc1\u8217*s earthly body in death \uc1\u8211* it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless, {\super\cf2\fs24 23}if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.

As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.

You are serving Christ, the Master. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.  {\cf1 4}Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master \uc1\u8211* in heaven.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all; {\super\cf2\fs24 3}recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master\uc1\u8217*s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For it was from you that the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead \uc1\u8211* Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 2}Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God\uc1\u8217*s good news in spite of great opposition. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Nor did we seek to win honour from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God\uc1\u8217*s good news, but our lives as well \uc1\u8211* so dear had you become to us. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}You will not have forgotten, friends, our labour and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God\uc1\u8217*s good news. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God \uc1\u8211* because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is \uc1\u8211* the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 17}As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time \uc1\u8211* though in body only, and not in spirit \uc1\u8211* made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}That was why we made up our minds to go and see you \uc1\u8211* at least I, Paul, did, more than once \uc1\u8211* but Satan put difficulties in our way. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn\uc1\u8217*t you? {\super\cf2\fs24 20}You are our pride and our delight! 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God\uc1\u8217*s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us \uc1\u8211* always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God? {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you; {\super\cf2\fs24 13}and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Advice on Daily Life

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 4}Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever \uc1\u8211* as indeed you are already doing \uc1\u8211* all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For this is God\uc1\u8217*s purpose \uc1\u8211* that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honourable, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For God\uc1\u8217*s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}We don\uc1\u8217*t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don\uc1\u8217*t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}This we tell you on the authority of the Lord \uc1\u8211* that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterwards we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 5}But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}When people are saying \uc1\u8220*All is quiet and safe,\uc1\u8221* it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape! {\super\cf2\fs24 4}You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}For you all are children of light and children of the day.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
We have nothing to do with night, or darkness. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another\uc1\u8217*s characters, as indeed you are doing.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God\uc1\u8217*s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God\uc1\u8217*s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin \uc1\u8211* banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}when he comes to be honoured in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) \uc1\u8211* as he will be on that day. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honoured in you, and you in him.

 {\cf1 2}As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}not lightly to let your minds become unsettled, or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message, or by any letter, purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Do not let anyone deceive you, whatever he may do. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of that Incarnation of Wickedness, that Lost Soul, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God! {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Don\uc1\u8217*t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this? {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret; but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Then will \uc1\u8220*Wickedness Incarnate\uc1\u8221* appear, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his lips, and annihilate him by the splendour of his coming. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For at the coming of the Lord there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie; {\super\cf2\fs24 12}so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}nor did we eat anyone\uc1\u8217*s bread without paying for it. Night and day, labouring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Saviour, and Christ Jesus, our hope. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}by one who recognises that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}for the immoral, for perverts, for slave-dealers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 11}as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that \uc1\u8220*Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners\uc1\u8221*! And there is no greater sinner than I! {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterwards to believe on him and attain eternal life. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you \uc1\u8211* Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions, {\super\cf2\fs24 19}with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances \uc1\u8211* the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.

 {\cf1 2}First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Saviour, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity \uc1\u8211* the human, Christ Jesus, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) \uc1\u8211* a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}but \uc1\u8211* as is proper for women who profess to be religious \uc1\u8211* with good actions. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Adam was formed first, not Eve. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 3}How true is this saying:{\super\cf2\fs24 1}\uc1\u8220*To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skilful teacher, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}they should provide for own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God? {\super\cf2\fs24 6}The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgement as the devil. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil\uc1\u8217*s trap. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Those who have filled that post with honour gain for themselves an honourable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.

  {\cf1 4}But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people\uc1\u8217*s consciences are seared, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected \uc1\u8211* provided only that it is received thankfully; {\super\cf2\fs24 5}for it is consecrated by God\uc1\u8217*s blessing and by prayer.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}As for profane legends and old wives\uc1\u8217* tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance! {\super\cf2\fs24 10}With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Saviour of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Remember these things in your teaching. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.

 {\cf1 5}Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters \uc1\u8211* with all purity. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Show consideration for widows \uc1\u8211* I mean those who are really widowed. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God\uc1\u8217*s sight. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.

Keep your life pure. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction \uc1\u8211* the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ \uc1\u8211* and to the teaching of religion, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarrelling, recriminations, base suspicions, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Of course religion is a great source of gain \uc1\u8211* when combined with contentment! {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}So, with food and shelter, we will be content. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.

It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 14}I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see \uc1\u8211* to whom be ascribed honour and power for ever.

For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began, {\super\cf2\fs24 10}and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and Immortality to light by that good news, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}of which I was myself appointed a herald and apostle, and teacher. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}For a supervisor, as God\uc1\u8217*s steward, ought to be of blameless character \uc1\u8211* not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught \uc1\u8211* so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}It was a Cretan \uc1\u8211* one of their own prophets \uc1\u8211* who said: \uc1\u8220*Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.\uc1\u8221* This statement is true. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, {\super\cf2\fs24 14}and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him.

 {\cf1 2}You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled \uc1\u8211* sound in faith, love, and patient endurance. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God\uc1\u8217*s message. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}In the same way with the younger men \uc1\u8211* encourage them to be self-controlled. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 8}let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Tell slaves to respect their owner\uc1\u8217*s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Saviour by all that they do.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}while awaiting our blessed hope \uc1\u8211* the appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.  {\cf1 3}Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarrelling, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}But, when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us, {\super\cf2\fs24 5}not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong.

This \uc1\u8220*placing of everything\uc1\u8221* under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honour; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}He says \uc1\u8211*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death \uc1\u8211* that is, the devil \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 15}and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity\uc1\u8217*s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.

 {\cf1 9}It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary \uc1\u8211* though only a material one. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron\uc1\u8217*s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written; {\super\cf2\fs24 5}while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper; {\super\cf2\fs24 10}the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions \uc1\u8211* external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands \uc1\u8211* that is to say, not a part of this present creation. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes), {\super\cf2\fs24 14}how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God! {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offences committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people, {\super\cf2\fs24 20}saying, as he did so \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 21}And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 23}While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood \uc1\u8211* but not his own blood; {\super\cf2\fs24 26}for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment), {\super\cf2\fs24 28}so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear \uc1\u8211* but without any burden of sin \uc1\u8211* to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord, {\super\cf2\fs24 8}vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.

 {\cf1 2}My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination? {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*There is a good seat for you here,\uc1\u8217* but to the poor man \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Haven\uc1\u8217*t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement? {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? {\super\cf2\fs24 6}But you \uc1\u8211* you insult the poor man!

 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them? {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}and one of you says to them \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!\uc1\u8217* and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them? {\super\cf2\fs24 17}In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}Someone, indeed, may say \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.\uc1\u8217*

Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing? {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar? {\super\cf2\fs24 22}You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions; {\super\cf2\fs24 23}and that in this way the words of scripture came true \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,\uc1\u8217* and \uc1\u8216*He was called the friend of God.\uc1\u8217* {\super\cf2\fs24 24}You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Wasn\uc1\u8217*t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab?

 {\cf1 3}Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}When we put bits into horses\uc1\u8217* mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze! {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honour to God even though they bear that name. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God\uc1\u8217*s good news? {\super\cf2\fs24 18}If \uc1\u8220*a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 19}Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.

Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers throughout the world. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}To him be ascribed dominion for ever.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge, {\super\cf2\fs24 6}knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety, {\super\cf2\fs24 7}piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past! {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Therefore, friends, do your best to put God\uc1\u8217*s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this \uc1\u8220*tent,\uc1\u8221* to rouse you by awakening memories of the past; {\super\cf2\fs24 14}for I know that the time for this \uc1\u8220*tent\uc1\u8221* of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 18}These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person\uc1\u8217*s unaided reason; {\super\cf2\fs24 21}for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

 {\cf1 2}But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbours; {\super\cf2\fs24 8}for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot\uc1\u8217*s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for \uc1\u8220*the day of judgment\uc1\u8221* \uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them, {\super\cf2\fs24 11}even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed \uc1\u8211* these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing, {\super\cf2\fs24 16}but was rebuked for his offence. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet\uc1\u8217*s madness. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people\uc1\u8217*s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}In their case is seen the truth of the proverb \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*A dog returns to what it has vomited\uc1\u8221* and \uc1\u8220*A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.\uc1\u8221*

 {\cf1 3}This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Saviour given to you through your apostles. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}will come and ask scoffingly \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 5}For they wilfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also \uc1\u8211* formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be \uc1\u8211* what holy and pious lives you ought to lead, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   Or: and desire its coming. }. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat, {\super\cf2\fs24 13}but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfilment of the promise of God.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Regard our Lord\uc1\u8217*s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness; {\super\cf2\fs24 18}and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 1}We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete.
\par}

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 Fellowship with God

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}If we say, \uc1\u8216*we have no sin,\uc1\u8217* then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}If we say that we haven\uc1\u8217*t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us. 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 2}My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father \uc1\u8211* Jesus Christ, the righteous. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}It is by keeping God\uc1\u8217*s commands that we can be sure we know him. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Whoever says \uc1\u8216*I know him,\uc1\u8217* but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}But the person who keeps God\uc1\u8217*s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him: {\super\cf2\fs24 6}whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you \uc1\u8211* which is shown true in Christ\uc1\u8217*s life and in yours \uc1\u8211* for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us \uc1\u8211* if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 22}Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist \uc1\u8211* one who rejects the Father and the Son. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}And this is what he himself promised us \uc1\u8211* eternal life!

Do what it has taught you: abide in him. {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn\uc1\u8217*t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming. {\super\cf2\fs24 29}Since you know he is righteous, you realise that everyone who does what is right is his child.

The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Dear friends, we are God\uc1\u8217*s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed.

The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil\uc1\u8217*s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}No child of God sins, because God\uc1\u8217*s nature dwells in them. They can\uc1\u8217*t live in sin, because they are God\uc1\u8217*s children. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil\uc1\u8217*s: anyone who doesn\uc1\u8217*t do what is right or doesn\uc1\u8217*t love others is not a child of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother\uc1\u8217*s were righteous.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}This is how we know that love is: Christ gave his life for us.

It must be true and show itself in actions.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God\uc1\u8217*s presence: {\super\cf2\fs24 20}though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence, {\super\cf2\fs24 22}and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}This is the way to recognise the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God\uc1\u8217*s Spirit, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}while a spirit that doesn\uc1\u8217*t acknowledge Jesus isn\uc1\u8217*t from God.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}We come from God.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs36 God is love

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}We love, because God first loved us. {\super\cf2\fs24 20}If someone says \uc1\u8220*I love God,\uc1\u8221* and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.

 {\cf1 5}Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child. {\super\cf2\fs24 2}By this we know that we love God\uc1\u8217*s children \uc1\u8211* when we love God and carry out his commands. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden, {\super\cf2\fs24 4}for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith! {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? {\super\cf2\fs24 6}Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood \uc1\u8211* not by water only but by water and blood \uc1\u8211* and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Indeed three testify: {\super\cf2\fs24 8}the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree. {\super\cf2\fs24 9}We accept human testimony, surely God\uc1\u8217*s testimony is even stronger! And God\uc1\u8217*s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son. {\super\cf2\fs24 10}The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn\uc1\u8217*t have God\uc1\u8217*s Son does not have life.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Now I want to remind you \uc1\u8211* but you already know it all \uc1\u8211* that, though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterwards destroyed those who refused to believe in him; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains and black darkness. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, punishment in eternal fire.

He laid his hand on me and said \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, {\super\cf2\fs24 18}the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever.

There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and round the throne there was a rainbow of the colour of an emerald. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}And round the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and round the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind. {\super\cf2\fs24 7}The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man\uc1\u8217*s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing. {\super\cf2\fs24 8}These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all round, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say \uc1\u8211*

 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. \uc1\u8220*Come here,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.\uc1\u8221* {\super\cf2\fs24 10}He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal. {\super\cf2\fs24 12}It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. {\super\cf2\fs24 14}The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall. {\super\cf2\fs24 16}The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal. {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured. {\super\cf2\fs24 18}The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass. {\super\cf2\fs24 19}The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald; {\super\cf2\fs24 20}the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst. {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass. {\super\cf2\fs24 22}And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple. {\super\cf2\fs24 23}The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb. {\super\cf2\fs24 24}The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. {\super\cf2\fs24 25}Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there. {\super\cf2\fs24 26}And people will bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. {\super\cf2\fs24 27}Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb\uc1\u8217*s book of life.  {\cf1 22}And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb, {\super\cf2\fs24 2}in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Every thing that is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him; {\super\cf2\fs24 4}they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.
