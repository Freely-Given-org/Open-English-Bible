<span class="verse" rel="v009001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  there. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 but to Hannah he used to give a double portion because he loved her. But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had shut up her womb. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had shut up her womb. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 This happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 But Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh, and stood before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and wept bitterly. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 She vowed a vow, saying, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “O  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of armies! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If you will indeed look on the affliction of your maid-servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; remember me and not forget your maid-servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but will give to your maid-servant a boy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; then I will give him to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  all the days of his life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A razor will not come upon his head.” <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 While she continued praying before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 So Eli said to her, “How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 “No, my lord,” Hannah answered, “I am an unfortunate woman! I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my heart before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 She said, “Let your maid-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  remembered her. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and named him Samuel <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb: Asked of God </span> , saying, “For I have asked him of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the yearly sacrifice and his vow. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he will appear in the presence of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and will live there forever.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  establish your word.” <br /><br /> So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in Shiloh. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 She said, “Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has granted me my petition which I asked of him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009001028" id="001028" >28</span>
 Now, I on my part have given him to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; as long as he lives he is given to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” So she left him there before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> And Hannah prayed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart exults in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; my strength is exalted in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; my mouth laughs at my enemies; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because I rejoice in your salvation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 There is none holy as the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; there is none like you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no rock like our God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Do not talk so proudly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let not arrogance come out of your mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is a God of knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and by him actions are weighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The bows of the mighty men are broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they that stumbled are girded with strength. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they that were hungry have ceased; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; while the barren has borne seven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; she who had many children has languished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  kills, and makes alive; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he brings down to the grave, and brings up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  makes poor, and makes rich; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he brings low, he also lifts up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 He raises up the poor out of the dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he lifts up the needy from the garbage heap <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to make them sit with princes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and inherit the throne of glory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the pillars of the earth are the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’S, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and he has set the world upon them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 He will guard the feet of his holy ones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for not by strength will humans prevail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v009002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 They who strive with the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be broken to pieces; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; against them will he thunder in heaven. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will judge the ends of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he will give strength to his king <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and exalt the power of his anointed. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in the presence of Eli the priest. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in Shiloh. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, “Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Should the man, however, say to him, “First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,” he would reply, “No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 The sin of the young men was very great before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for the men had contempt for the offering of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 And Samuel continued ministering before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – a lad girded with a linen ephod. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” Then they would return to their own home. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew up before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Now Eli was very old; and whenver he heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 he said to them, “Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  spreading abroad. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, who could act as mediator for him?” Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  desired to slay them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and of men. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 There came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “This is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message: I revealed myself to your father’s house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh’s house, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to your father’s house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 Why do you look with envious eyes on my sacrifices and offerings, and honor your sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel says, ‘I had indeed thought that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever,’ but now the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says, ‘Far be it from me, for them who honor me I will honor, and they who despise me will be lightly esteemed. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 You will look in affliction and enviously on all the prosperity which I will give Israel, and there will not be an old man in your house forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002033" id="002033" >33</span>
 The only one of you whom I do not cut off from my altar will be spared to weep out his eyes and to wear out his body, and all of your household will die by the sword of men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002034" id="002034" >34</span>
 This will be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both will die. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002035" id="002035" >35</span>
 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire, and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before my anointed forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009002036" id="002036" >36</span>
 Anyone who is left in your house will come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and will beg to be given in one of the priests’ offices so that they may eat a morsel of bread.’” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> The child Samuel continued ministering before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in the presence of Eli. The word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was rare in those days; there were no frequent visions. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel place – his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see – 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  where the ark of God was, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  called, “Samuel! Samuel!” He said, “Here I am.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he said, “I didn’t call, lie down again.” So he went and lay down. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  called yet again, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Now Samuel did not yet know the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  neither had the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  yet been revealed to him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 So when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” Then Eli realized that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was calling the child. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 So Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, ‘Speak,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for your servant is listening.”’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came, and stood there, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant is listening.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the ears of everyone who hears it will ring. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli’s house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 And Samuel lay there until the morning. Then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Samuel was afraid to make the known the vision to Eli. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “I am here.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 He said, “What is the thing that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken to you? Hide nothing from me. May God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 So Samuel told him everything; and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; let him do what seems good to him.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 And Samuel grew, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  again appeared in Shiloh, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  revealed himself to Samuel, <span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> and the word of Samuel came to all Israel. </p><h6>Samuel the judge</h6><p> Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 So they sent to Shiloh; and took from there the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 When the ark of God the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to the camp, all Israel shouted such a great shout that the earth rang. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does this great shouting in the Hebrew’s camp mean?” When they learned that the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had come to the camp, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 they were afraid, and said, “These are their gods. They have come to them to the camp. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Woe to Woe to us! Nothin like this has happened to us before! Who can deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague and pesilence. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, so that you will not become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and each fled to his home. There fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 A Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, “What is this tumultuous noise?” The man came quickly and told Eli. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see). 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle, for I fled today from the ranks.” He said, “How went the matter, my son?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 He that brought the tidings answered, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and near her time. When she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and crouched down and gave birth to a child. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 As she lay dying, the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she neither answered nor heeded. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory is taken away from Israel,” meaning the capture of the ark of God, and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009004022" id="004022" >22</span>
 “Glory has left Israel,” she said, “because the ark of God is taken.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Then the Philistines took the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 When the Ashdodites arose early the next day, there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. They raised up Dagon and set him in his place again. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. The head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but step over it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 The hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its borders. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was against the city – there was a very great panic – and he struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tomors broke out on them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, let it go back to its own place and not kill us and our people.” For a deadly panic had seized the entire city. The hand of God was very heavy there. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 The men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> The ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was in the country of the Philistines for seven months. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? Show us how we should send it to its place.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty. You must return to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 Then they were asked, “What should the guilt offering be which we should return to him?” and they said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden rats, corresponding to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your lords. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 Therefore you should make images of your tumors, and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you should give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from on you and your gods and your land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 Why be stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh were stubborn? Remember how he made sport of them until they let Israel go? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 So take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows which have never been yoked, and fasten the cows to the cart. But leave their calves behind them at home. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Take the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a guilt offering in a box at its side. Then send it on its way. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Watch; if it goes on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it was the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was did us this great harm, but if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that stuck us but it was an accident that happened to us.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 The men did all this. They took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 They placed the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  on the cart, and the box with the golden rats and the images of their tumors. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 The cows took a straight course in the direction of Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn left nor right. The lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. They lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 When the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, it stood still there, near a great stone. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 The Levites took down the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  on that day burnt offerings and ordinary sacrifices. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 The golden rats correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. A witness is the great stone, by which they set down the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 The descendents of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Beth-shemesh, when they welcomed the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. So he killed seventy of them, and the people mourned because the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had struck the people with such a great slaughter. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 The people of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, this holy God? To whom can we send him to be rid of him?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Come and take it back with you.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> So the people of Kiriath-jearim came, and took the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 Many years passed from the time the ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim – twenty years. All the nation of Israel turned to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 and Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are returning to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you and direct your hearts towards the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve him alone, so that he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 So the Israelites put away the Baals and the Astartes, and served the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  only. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and fasted all day and confessed, “We have sinned against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” And Samuel judged the Israelites in Mizpah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 and said to Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God for us, so that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  on behalf of Israel, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 While Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  thundered with a mighty voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 The men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them until they were below Beth-car. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer, saying, “This is how far the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has helped us.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was against the Philistines as long as Samuel lived. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel recovered their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 He used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he used to judge Israel in all those places. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 But he always returned to Ramah, for there was his home, and there he judged Israel. There he built an altar to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. </p><h4>Samuel and Saul</h4><p></p><h6>Development of Monarchy</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 The eldest was called Joel, and his second was called Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 However his sons did not follow his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 So all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 and they said to him, “You have become old and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint for us a king to rule us like all the other nations.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people and all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 Listen to what they have to say, but solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who will reign over them.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Samuel told all the words of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to the people who were asking him to appoint a king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 He said, “This will be the way of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and cavalry. They will run before his chariots, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the equipment for his chariots. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 Of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 He will take a tenth of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and your donkeys, and use them for his work. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his slaves. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 Then you will cry out in that day against your king whom you chose for yourselves, but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will not answer you in that day.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, “No, we must have a king over us, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 so that we will like all other the nations, and so that our king can rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and make them a king.” And Samuel said to the people of Israel, “Each of your return to your city.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 He had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was. He was a head taller than any of the people. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had strayed. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the servants with you and go out and find the donkeys.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. They passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, or my father will stop thinking of the donkeys and become anxious for us.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 But the servant answered, “There is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honor. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now, and perhaps he can give us information about the mission on which we are going.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Saul said to the boy, “But, suppose we go, what should we take to the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What do we have?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 The servant answered Saul again, “See I have with me a quarter shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God so that he may give us information regarding our mission.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 (Formerly in Israel, when someone went to inquire of God, they said, “Come let us go to the seer;” because what is nowadays called a prophet was previously called a seer). 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 Then Saul said to his servant, “Your advice is good. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met some young girls going out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 They answered, “Yes, he is there ahead of you. Hurry, he has come today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he is needed to bless the sacrifice before the guests eat. Now go up, and at this time you will meet him.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 So they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 Now the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation: 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 “At this time tomorrow I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin and you must anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, because I have seen the suffering of my people, and their cry has reached me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 When Samuel saw Saul, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  indicated to him, “This is the man of whom I spoke to you! He is the one who will rule over my people.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 And Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you will eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them. They have been found. To whom does all that is desirable in Israel belong? Does it not belong to you, and to your ancestral house? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 Saul answered, “But I am a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin! Why do you speak like this to me?” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons). 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 And he said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 The cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, “See, the meat is served! Eat! It was kept for you until the appointed time, so that you might eat with those whom I have invited.” <br /><br /> So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down for the night. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 At daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, so that I can send you on your way.” So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell your servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay here so that I can make known to you the word of God.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has anointed you to be a ruler over his people Israel. You will reign over the people of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and save them from the power of their enemies all around. This will be the sign that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has anointed you to be a ruler over his heritage: 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 when you go from me today you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the donkeys and is anxious for you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 Then you will go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor. There three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you will take from their hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 After that you will come to Gibeah-elohim, where the garrison of the Philistines is. When you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them, and they will be prophesying. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 The spirit of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 When these signs come to you, you will do as the occasion offers, for God is with you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 You must go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 As Saul turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him a change of heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 On his way to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the spirit of God possessed him, and he prophesied among them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 When everyone who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 One of the bystanders answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 When he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” He said, “To find the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010015" id="010015" >15</span>
 And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us that the donkeys were found.” But about the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 Samuel called the people together to Mizpah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 and said to the Israelites, “This is what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel says: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 But today you rejected your God, who has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No! You must set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  by your tribes and by your clans.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was picked by lot. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their clans, and the clan of the Matrites was picked by lot. He brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was picked, but when they searched for him, him he could not be found. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 So they asked of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  further, “Did the man come here?” And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered “See, he has hid himself among the baggage.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010023" id="010023" >23</span>
 Someone ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people by a head. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010024" id="010024" >24</span>
 Said Samuel to the people, “Have you seen this man whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people.” All the people shouted loudly, “Long live the king!” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009010025" id="010025" >25</span>
 In this way Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to their home. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010026" id="010026" >26</span>
 And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and with him went the warriors whose hearts God had touched. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009010027" id="010027" >27</span>
 But there were some scoundrels who said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no presents. </p><h6>Saul the king</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> About a month later Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make terms with us and we will serve you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition will I make terms with you: that I gouge out the right eye of each of you and by this bring disgrace on all Israel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days respite, so that we can send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be no one to save us we will surrender to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 Saul was just coming from the field, driving the oxen. He said, “What is the trouble with the people? Why are they weeping?” Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 The spirit of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen!” Then a terror from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 He mustered them in Bezek. The Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 They said to the messengers who came, “Say this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance will have come to you.” So the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh. They rejoiced, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 and said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you please.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 On the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions. They came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and massacred the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. The survivors scattered, so that no two of them were left together. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Saul will not reign over us?’ Bring the men that we may put them to death!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 But Saul said, “Today no one will be put to death, because today the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has brought deliverance to Israel.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 All the people went to Gilgal. There they made Saul king before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in Gilgal, and sacrificed peace offerings before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and there Saul and all the men of Israel held a great celebration. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> Samuel said to all Israel, “See, I have listened to you in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 From now on, behold the king who will lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth to this day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 Here I am! Testify against me before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and before his annointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I oppressed? Whom have I defrauded? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to turn a blind eye? Testify and I will restore it to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 They said, “You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012005" id="012005" >5</span>
 So he said to them, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” They said, “He is witness.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 Then Samuel said to the people, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012007" id="012007" >7</span>
 Now therefore take your stand so that I may declare to you before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  all the righteous acts of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, which he did to you and to your ancestors. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012008" id="012008" >8</span>
 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your ancestors cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors out of Egypt, and settled them in this place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 But they forgot the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of King Jabin of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab. They fought against them, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 and cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and said, “We have sinned because we have forsaken the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and served the Baals and the Astartes. Deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samson, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies surrounding you so that you lived in safety. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 But when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king must reign over us,’ although the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God was your king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has now set a king over you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 If you will fear the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, then it will be well. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 But if you will not listen to the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, but rebel against the commandment of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, then will the hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be against you and your king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is about to do before your eyes. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to send thunder and rain. You will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in asking for a king.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012018" id="012018" >18</span>
 So Samuel called upon the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent thunder and rain that day. All the people were greatly afraid of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and Samuel. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009012019" id="012019" >19</span>
 Then all the people said to Samuel, “Intercede with the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God in behalf of your servants so that we do not die, because we have added to all our sins the crime of asking for a king.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012020" id="012020" >20</span>
 But Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, you have indeed done all this evil, but do not turn aside from following the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  with all your heart, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012021" id="012021" >21</span>
 and do not turn aside after useless things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are useless. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012022" id="012022" >22</span>
 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  because of his great name will not cast away his people, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has undertaken to make you his own people. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012023" id="012023" >23</span>
 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012024" id="012024" >24</span>
 Only fear the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see the great things he has done for you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009012025" id="012025" >25</span>
 But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king will be swept away. <span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> Saul was … years old when he began to reign, and he reigned … and two years over Israel. <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       The numbers are missing from the text. </span><br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent to their homes. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the news reached the Philistines that the Hebrews were in revolt. But Saul had in the meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 and all Israel heard the news that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. The people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel – thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and fighters as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 When the Israelites saw that they were in a strait (for the fighters were hard pressed), they hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013007" id="013007" >7</span>
 Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 He waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013009" id="013009" >9</span>
 So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.” He offered the burnt-offering. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013010" id="013010" >10</span>
 Just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Samuel came, and Saul went out to greet him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013011" id="013011" >11</span>
 Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013012" id="013012" >12</span>
 I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down to me at Gilgal, and I will not have appeased the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt-offering.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013013" id="013013" >13</span>
 Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, which he commanded you, then would the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013014" id="013014" >14</span>
 But now your kingdom will not continue. The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has sought out a man after his own heart, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has appointed him a leader over his people, because you have not kept that which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  commanded you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013015" id="013015" >15</span>
 Then Samuel arose and left Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul, going from Gilgal towards Gibeah of Benjamin. <br /><br /> Saul counted the people who were with him, about six hundred men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013016" id="013016" >16</span>
 Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013017" id="013017" >17</span>
 Raiding parties came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013018" id="013018" >18</span>
 and another division turned in the direction of Beth-horon, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009013019" id="013019" >19</span>
 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “The Hebrews must not make swords or spears,” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013020" id="013020" >20</span>
 so all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his sickle and his ax and his mattock. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013021" id="013021" >21</span>
 The charge was two thirds of a shekel for ploughshares and mattocks, and one third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and setting the ox goads. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009013022" id="013022" >22</span>
 So on the day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009013023" id="013023" >23</span>
 A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash, <span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> and one day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come – let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014002" id="014002" >2</span>
 Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree at Mignon, and with him were about six hundred men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 One crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  from saving by many or by few.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014007" id="014007" >7</span>
 His armor-bearer said to him, “Do whatever your judgement dictates. I am with you, your wish is mine.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 Then Jonathan said, “We will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014009" id="014009" >9</span>
 If they say to us, ‘Stand still until we can reach you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign to us.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 When both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 The men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us so that we can tell you something.” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given them into the hand of Israel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer kept despatching them after him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014014" id="014014" >14</span>
 In the first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer slew about twenty men in an area of about half an acre. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014015" id="014015" >15</span>
 There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and even the raiders trembled and the earth quaked so that it produced a great panic. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014016" id="014016" >16</span>
 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw the army surging hither and thither. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014017" id="014017" >17</span>
 Saul said to the people who were with him, “Investigate now and see who is gone from us.” When they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014018" id="014018" >18</span>
 And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here,” for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014019" id="014019" >19</span>
 While Saul was speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. So Saul said to the priest, “Draw back your hand.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014020" id="014020" >20</span>
 And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle, and every man’s sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014021" id="014021" >21</span>
 The Hebrews who had gone over to the Philistines and joined their the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014022" id="014022" >22</span>
 Likewise all the Israelites who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, pursued close after them in the battle. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014023" id="014023" >23</span>
 So the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  saved Israel that day, and the battle passed on beyond Beth-aven. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014024" id="014024" >24</span>
 Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014025" id="014025" >25</span>
 Now there was honeycomb in that country, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014026" id="014026" >26</span>
 and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014027" id="014027" >27</span>
 But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people. He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014028" id="014028" >28</span>
 Then one of the fighters spoke up, “Your father charged the people saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’ So the men are exhausted.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014029" id="014029" >29</span>
 Then said Jonathan, “My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014030" id="014030" >30</span>
 If only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines!” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014031" id="014031" >31</span>
 But they struck at the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014032" id="014032" >32</span>
 and they rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014033" id="014033" >33</span>
 When Saul was told that the people were sinning against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, “Treason! Roll a great stone to me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014034" id="014034" >34</span>
 And Saul said, “Go out among the people and say to them, ‘Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in eating the flesh together with the blood.’” All the people brought their oxen that night and slew them there. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014035" id="014035" >35</span>
 So Saul built an altar to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. That was the first altar that he built to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014036" id="014036" >36</span>
 Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder among them until daybreak, and let us not spare a single man.” They said, “Do whatever you think best,” but the priest said, “Let us first consut God.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014037" id="014037" >37</span>
 So Saul asked of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But there was no answer that day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014038" id="014038" >38</span>
 And Saul said, “Come here, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt today. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014039" id="014039" >39</span>
 For as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, who delivered Israel, even if it be in Jonathan my son, that man will surely die.” But no one of all the people answered him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014040" id="014040" >40</span>
 Then he said to all Israel, “You will on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014041" id="014041" >41</span>
 Therefore Saul asked the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant this day? If the guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, God of Israel, give Urim, but if the guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And the lot indicated Jonathan and Saul, and the people were cleared. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014042" id="014042" >42</span>
 And Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  indicates, must die.” The people said to Saul, “It must not be so!” But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was indicated. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014043" id="014043" >43</span>
 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, saying, “I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand, and here I am! I am ready to die.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014044" id="014044" >44</span>
 And Saul said, “May God do to me whatever he pleases, you must surely die, Jonathan!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014045" id="014045" >45</span>
 But the people said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014046" id="014046" >46</span>
 Then Saul broke off from pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own country. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014047" id="014047" >47</span>
 When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned he was victorious. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014048" id="014048" >48</span>
 He did mighty deeds and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014049" id="014049" >49</span>
 Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014050" id="014050" >50</span>
 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son Saul’s uncle Ner. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009014051" id="014051" >51</span>
 Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009014052" id="014052" >52</span>
 The war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would take him into his service. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="015001">15</span> Samuel said to Saul, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now listen to the words of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015002" id="015002" >2</span>
 This says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of armies: ‘I have determined to punish the Amalekites for wha they did to Israel, in opposing them as they came up out of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015003" id="015003" >3</span>
 Now go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have. Spare no one but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009015004" id="015004" >4</span>
 So Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015005" id="015005" >5</span>
 When Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015006" id="015006" >6</span>
 Saul said to the Kenites, “Go away, withdraw from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015007" id="015007" >7</span>
 And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015008" id="015008" >8</span>
 He took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015009" id="015009" >9</span>
 But Saul and his army spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fat beasts, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them. But everything that was worthless and despised they completely destroyed. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009015010" id="015010" >10</span>
 Then the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Samuel saying, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015011" id="015011" >11</span>
 “I repent of making Saul king, because he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands.” And Samuel was angry and cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  all night. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015012" id="015012" >12</span>
 Early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, “Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument to himself and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015013" id="015013" >13</span>
 When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “Blessed be you of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>! I have fulfilled the command of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015014" id="015014" >14</span>
 And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015015" id="015015" >15</span>
 And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best off the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, and the rest we have completely destroyed.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015016" id="015016" >16</span>
 Then Samuel said to “Saul, Stop! and let me tell you what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has said to me this night.” He said to him, “Speak.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009015017" id="015017" >17</span>
 Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  anointed you king over Israel, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015018" id="015018" >18</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent you on an expedition and said, ‘Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015019" id="015019" >19</span>
 Why then did you not obey the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015020" id="015020" >20</span>
 And Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and have gone on the expedition which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent me on and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have completely destroyed the Amalekites. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015021" id="015021" >21</span>
 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban, to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God in Gilgal.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015022" id="015022" >22</span>
 And Samuel said, “Does the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015023" id="015023" >23</span>
 For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, he has rejected you from being king.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015024" id="015024" >24</span>
 And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015025" id="015025" >25</span>
 Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015026" id="015026" >26</span>
 But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has rejected you from being king over Israel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015027" id="015027" >27</span>
 As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015028" id="015028" >28</span>
 Then Samuel said to him, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has today torn the kingdom of Israel from you and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015029" id="015029" >29</span>
 Moreover the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a mortal that he should change his mind.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015030" id="015030" >30</span>
 Then Saul said, “I have sinned, yet honor me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, so that I may worship the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015031" id="015031" >31</span>
 So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009015032" id="015032" >32</span>
 Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him trembling and said, “Surely death is bitter.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015033" id="015033" >33</span>
 Samuel said, “As your sword has bereaved women, so will your mother be the most bereaved of women.” Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in Gilgal. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009015034" id="015034" >34</span>
 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009015035" id="015035" >35</span>
 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. </p><h4>Saul, Jonathan, and David</h4><p></p><h6>David at the court of Saul</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king among his sons.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016002" id="016002" >2</span>
 And Samuel said, “How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me?” But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, “Take a calf with you and say you have come to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016003" id="016003" >3</span>
 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do, and anoint the man whom I name.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016004" id="016004" >4</span>
 So Samuel did that which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016005" id="016005" >5</span>
 He said “Yes, I have come to sacrifice to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Purify yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sacrifice.” He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009016006" id="016006" >6</span>
 When they came and he saw Eliab, he said, “Surely the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s annointed is now in presence.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016007" id="016007" >7</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Pay no attention to his appearance or to the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  does not see as humans see, for they look on the outward appearance, but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  looks at the heart.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016008" id="016008" >8</span>
 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, “Neither has the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  chosen this one.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016009" id="016009" >9</span>
 Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  chosen this one. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016010" id="016010" >10</span>
 Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has not chosen these.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016011" id="016011" >11</span>
 And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all your sons?” He said, “There is still the youngest, but he is a shepherd with the flock.” So Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016012" id="016012" >12</span>
 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was handsome, a youth with beautiful eyes and ruddy cheeks. And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, “Get up, anoint him, for this is the man.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016013" id="016013" >13</span>
 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The spirit of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009016014" id="016014" >14</span>
 Now the spirit of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  tormented him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016015" id="016015" >15</span>
 And Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016016" id="016016" >16</span>
 Command your servants who are before and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he will play with his hand, and you will be better.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016017" id="016017" >17</span>
 So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016018" id="016018" >18</span>
 One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a good fighter, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is with him.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016019" id="016019" >19</span>
 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the flock.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016020" id="016020" >20</span>
 And Jesse took ten loaves of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul with David his son. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016021" id="016021" >21</span>
 So David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul loved him so much that he became one of his armor-bearers, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016022" id="016022" >22</span>
 and sent a message to Jesse, saying, “Let David enter my service, for he has found favor in my sight.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009016023" id="016023" >23</span>
 Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="017001">17</span> Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war. They were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017002" id="017002" >2</span>
 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle-array against the Philistines. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017003" id="017003" >3</span>
 The Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017004" id="017004" >4</span>
 A champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath of Gath and he was over nine feet in height. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was clad with a bronze breastplate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017007" id="017007" >7</span>
 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds. His shield-bearer went before him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017008" id="017008" >8</span>
 He stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul’s servants? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017009" id="017009" >9</span>
 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017010" id="017010" >10</span>
 The Philistine said, “I have insulted the ranks of Israel today! Give me a man that we may fight together.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017011" id="017011" >11</span>
 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017012" id="017012" >12</span>
 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. The man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017013" id="017013" >13</span>
 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war. Their names were Eliab, the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017014" id="017014" >14</span>
 David was the youngest. The three eldest had followed Saul, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017015" id="017015" >15</span>
 while David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017016" id="017016" >16</span>
 The Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand for forty days. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017017" id="017017" >17</span>
 One day Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017018" id="017018" >18</span>
 But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand and look after your brothers’ welfare and bring back some token of assurance from them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017019" id="017019" >19</span>
 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017020" id="017020" >20</span>
 So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017021" id="017021" >21</span>
 Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017022" id="017022" >22</span>
 David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the welfare of his brothers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017023" id="017023" >23</span>
 Just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before, and David heard them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017024" id="017024" >24</span>
 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017025" id="017025" >25</span>
 “Have you seen this man who has come up?” they said, “Surely he has come up to insult Israel. Whoever kills him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter and will make his father’s house free in Israel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017026" id="017026" >26</span>
 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, “What should be done for the man who strikes that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017027" id="017027" >27</span>
 The people answered him in the words just given, “This is what will be done to the man who kills him.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017028" id="017028" >28</span>
 Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart. You have come down to see the battle.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017029" id="017029" >29</span>
 David said, “What have I done now? It was only a question.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017030" id="017030" >30</span>
 Turning away from him to another, he spoke as before, and the people answered him again as at the first time. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017031" id="017031" >31</span>
 When the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They took him and brought him before Saul. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017032" id="017032" >32</span>
 David said to Saul, “Let not my lord’s courage fail him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017033" id="017033" >33</span>
 Saul answered, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. You are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017034" id="017034" >34</span>
 But David said to Saul, “Your servant was a shepherd with his father’s flock, and when a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017035" id="017035" >35</span>
 I would go out after him and kill him and rescue the lamb from his mouth. If he rose up against me, I would seize him by his jaw and slay him with a blow. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017036" id="017036" >36</span>
 Your servant has killed both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017037" id="017037" >37</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be with you.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017038" id="017038" >38</span>
 Saul clothed David with his armor, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017039" id="017039" >39</span>
 David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these because I am not used to them. And he took them off. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017040" id="017040" >40</span>
 He took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017041" id="017041" >41</span>
 The Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017042" id="017042" >42</span>
 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he had nothing but disdain for him, because he was only a youth with ruddy cheeks, a young man of attractive appearance. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017043" id="017043" >43</span>
 The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog that you come to me with a stick?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017044" id="017044" >44</span>
 and said, “Come to me so that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017045" id="017045" >45</span>
 Then David answered the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of armies, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017046" id="017046" >46</span>
 Today the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will deliver you into my hands, that I may strike you and cut off your head. I will this day give the dead of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017047" id="017047" >47</span>
 so that all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear does the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  save, for the battle is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s and he will give you into our hand.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017048" id="017048" >48</span>
 When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017049" id="017049" >49</span>
 David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017050" id="017050" >50</span>
 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and struck down the Philistine, killing him, although there was no sword in David’s hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017051" id="017051" >51</span>
 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, drawing it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. <br /><br /> When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017052" id="017052" >52</span>
 The men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017053" id="017053" >53</span>
 When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017054" id="017054" >54</span>
 but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armor in his tent. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009017055" id="017055" >55</span>
 When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this lad?” And Abner said, “As you live, O king, I cannot tell.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017056" id="017056" >56</span>
 The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017057" id="017057" >57</span>
 When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009017058" id="017058" >58</span>
 Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, my lad?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” <span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span> Now when David had finished speaking with Saul, the lives of Jonathan and David became bound together, and Jonathon loved him as his own life, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018002" id="018002" >2</span>
 and so Saul took David that day and would not let him return to his father’s house. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018003" id="018003" >3</span>
 Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own life. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018004" id="018004" >4</span>
 He stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018005" id="018005" >5</span>
 And David went out. On every task which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul appointed him over the warriors. He was beloved alike by all the people and by the servants of Saul. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018006" id="018006" >6</span>
 At the return home of the army and David’s return from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018007" id="018007" >7</span>
 The women sang to each other as they danced, “Saul has slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018008" id="018008" >8</span>
 It made Saul very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 The next day an evil spirit from God came powerfully on Saul, and he prophesied within his house. David played the lyre to him, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018011" id="018011" >11</span>
 and cast it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But twice David dodged it. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018012" id="018012" >12</span>
 Saul was afraid of David, because the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was with him and had departed from Saul. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018013" id="018013" >13</span>
 So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander over a thousand. David went out and came in at the head of his men, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 and he acted wisely and prospered in all his ways, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was with him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018015" id="018015" >15</span>
 When Saul saw that David acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018016" id="018016" >16</span>
 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at the head of the army. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018017" id="018017" >17</span>
 Then Saul said to David, “See my oldest daughter, Merab. I will give her to you as wife, only be a valiant champion and fight the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s battles.” For Saul said to himself, “I must not raise my hand against him, but let the hand of the Philistines deal with him.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018018" id="018018" >18</span>
 And David replied to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my father’s clan in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018019" id="018019" >19</span>
 But when the time came that Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018020" id="018020" >20</span>
 Michal, Saul’s daughter, fell in love with David. When they told Saul, he was pleased. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018021" id="018021" >21</span>
 He thought, “I will give her to him, so that she becomes a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You will this day be my son-in-law.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018022" id="018022" >22</span>
 Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly and tell him that the king is pleased with him and all the servants love him, therefore become the king’s son-in-law.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018023" id="018023" >23</span>
 And Saul’s servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, “Is it an easy thing in your opinion to become the king’s son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018024" id="018024" >24</span>
 The servants of Saul reported back what David had said. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018025" id="018025" >25</span>
 And Saul said, “Tell David: The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.” Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018026" id="018026" >26</span>
 When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king’s son-in-law. Before the appointed time, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018027" id="018027" >27</span>
 he arose and went together with his men and slew a hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and gave them in full to the king, in order to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018028" id="018028" >28</span>
 When Saul saw and knew that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was with David and his daughter Michal loved him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009018029" id="018029" >29</span>
 Saul feared David still more, and from that time was David’s enemy. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009018030" id="018030" >30</span>
 The Philistine commanders continued to come out to battle, and as often as they came out, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute. </p><h6>David flees Saul</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="019001">19</span> Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, was very fond of David, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019002" id="019002" >2</span>
 and told David, “Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now, I beg you, take care in the morning and stay in concealment and hide yourself. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover I will tell you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019004" id="019004" >4</span>
 Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019005" id="019005" >5</span>
 He took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019006" id="019006" >6</span>
 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and gave an oath, “As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, David will not be put to death.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019007" id="019007" >7</span>
 And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as before. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009019008" id="019008" >8</span>
 But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019009" id="019009" >9</span>
 Then an evil spirit from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that Saul hurled the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009019011" id="019011" >11</span>
 That night Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019012" id="019012" >12</span>
 Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019013" id="019013" >13</span>
 Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat’s hair for its head and covered it with the garment. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019014" id="019014" >14</span>
 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019015" id="019015" >15</span>
 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019016" id="019016" >16</span>
 When the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat’s hair for its pillow. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019017" id="019017" >17</span>
 And Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me: Let me go, why should I kill you?” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009019018" id="019018" >18</span>
 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019019" id="019019" >19</span>
 When Saul was told thqt David was there at Naioth in Ramah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019020" id="019020" >20</span>
 he sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophesied. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019021" id="019021" >21</span>
 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019022" id="019022" >22</span>
 Then Saul himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone answered, “They are at Naioth in Ramah.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019023" id="019023" >23</span>
 But on his journey to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009019024" id="019024" >24</span>
 He too stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span> David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin against your father, that he is seeking my life?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020002" id="020002" >2</span>
 He replied to him, “Far from it! You will not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me? It can’t be true!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020003" id="020003" >3</span>
 David answered, “Your father well knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, ‘Let not Jonathan know this or he will be pained.’ Nevertheless as surely as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020004" id="020004" >4</span>
 Then Jonathan said to David, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 And David answered Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king. Therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020006" id="020006" >6</span>
 If your father misses me, then say, ‘David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020007" id="020007" >7</span>
 If he says ‘Good,’ then it is well with your servant, but if it arouses his anger, then know that he intends evil on me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020008" id="020008" >8</span>
 Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. If there is guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020009" id="020009" >9</span>
 And Jonathan said, “No! For if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020010" id="020010" >10</span>
 Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, if your father answers you harshly?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020011" id="020011" >11</span>
 And Jonathan replied to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020012" id="020012" >12</span>
 And Jonathan said to David, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time tomorrow or the next day, and if is well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020013" id="020013" >13</span>
 May God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. May the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be with you, as he has been with my father. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020014" id="020014" >14</span>
 If I am yet alive, show me the kindness of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>! But if I should die, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020015" id="020015" >15</span>
 continue your kindness to my household forever, even if the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020016" id="020016" >16</span>
 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  seek out the enemies of David.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020017" id="020017" >17</span>
 Jonathan took an oath again with David, because of his love to him. With all his heart he loved him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020018" id="020018" >18</span>
 Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020019" id="020019" >19</span>
 On the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you should go to the place where you hid yourself the other time, and sit down there beside the heap of stones. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020020" id="020020" >20</span>
 I will shoot three arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020021" id="020021" >21</span>
 Then I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are on this side of you, pick them up!’ – then come; for it is safe for you, and, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, there is no danger. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020022" id="020022" >22</span>
 But if I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are beyond you,’, go, for then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sends you away. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020023" id="020023" >23</span>
 As to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is witness between you and me forever. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009020024" id="020024" >24</span>
 So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020025" id="020025" >25</span>
 The king sat upon his seat as usual, on the seat by the wall, with Jonathan opposite, and Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020026" id="020026" >26</span>
 Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, ‘It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020027" id="020027" >27</span>
 But when on the day following the new moon, David’s place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020028" id="020028" >28</span>
 And Jonathan answered Saul, “David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020029" id="020029" >29</span>
 for he said, ‘Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away and see my brothers.’ Hence he has not come to the king’s table.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009020030" id="020030" >30</span>
  Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “Son of a depraved woman! Don’t I know that you are associated with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020031" id="020031" >31</span>
 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020032" id="020032" >32</span>
 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020033" id="020033" >33</span>
 But Saul lifted up his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020034" id="020034" >34</span>
 Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009020035" id="020035" >35</span>
 In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020036" id="020036" >36</span>
 He said to his boy, “Run, find and the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020037" id="020037" >37</span>
 When the boy came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020038" id="020038" >38</span>
 Jonathan cried after the boy, “Hurry, quick, do not stop!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020039" id="020039" >39</span>
 But the boy had no knowledge of anything. Only Jonathan and David understood what this meant. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020040" id="020040" >40</span>
 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020041" id="020041" >41</span>
 As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009020042" id="020042" >42</span>
 Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.” Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone and no one with you?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021002" id="021002" >2</span>
 David answered Ahimelech the priest, “The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you.’ I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021003" id="021003" >3</span>
 Now if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or whatever can be found, give it to me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread at hand. There is holy bread, but only if the young men have kept themselves from women.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021005" id="021005" >5</span>
 David answered the priest, “Women have been kept from us, as always when I set out on an expedition. The weapons of the young men were consecrated even on an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their weapons be holy!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021006" id="021006" >6</span>
 So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presense, that was taken from before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009021007" id="021007" >7</span>
 (Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul’s herdsmen.) 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021008" id="021008" >8</span>
 David said to Ahimelech, “Have you not here at hand a spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter required haste.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.” And David said, “There is none like that, give it to me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021010" id="021010" >10</span>
 Then David rose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Was it not of him that they used to sing to each other in the dances, saying, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Saul has slain his thousands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But David his ten thousands?” <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009021012" id="021012" >12</span>
 David took these words to his heart and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021013" id="021013" >13</span>
 He pretended to be insane before them, and raved in their hands and drummed on the doors and let his spittle run down his beard. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021014" id="021014" >14</span>
 Achish said to his servants, “You see plainly that the man is mad; why do you bring him to me? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009021015" id="021015" >15</span>
 Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act the madman in my presence? Should this one come into my house?” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="022001">22</span> So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s clan heard of it, they went down there to him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022002" id="022002" >2</span>
 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022003" id="022003" >3</span>
 David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Let my father and my mother shelter with you, until I know what God will do for me.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022004" id="022004" >4</span>
 He left them in the presences of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022005" id="022005" >5</span>
 Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold. Depart and go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009022006" id="022006" >6</span>
 When Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered, he was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022007" id="022007" >7</span>
 Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, “Listen Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022008" id="022008" >8</span>
 Is that why all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity on me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me, as is now the case?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022009" id="022009" >9</span>
 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022010" id="022010" >10</span>
 He inquired of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009022011" id="022011" >11</span>
 Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022012" id="022012" >12</span>
 Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub!” He answered, “Here am I, my lord!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022013" id="022013" >13</span>
 And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me with the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022014" id="022014" >14</span>
 Then Ahimelech answered the king, “But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king’s son-in-law and captain over your retainers and honored in your household? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022015" id="022015" >15</span>
 Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022016" id="022016" >16</span>
 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022017" id="022017" >17</span>
 The king said to the runners who stood before him, “Turn about and slay the priests of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022018" id="022018" >18</span>
 Then the king said to Doeg, “Turn and strike down the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore the ephod. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022019" id="022019" >19</span>
 The priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009022020" id="022020" >20</span>
 One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022021" id="022021" >21</span>
 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022022" id="022022" >22</span>
 David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009022023" id="022023" >23</span>
 Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine. You will be safe with me.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="023001">23</span> David was told that Philistines were fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023002" id="023002" >2</span>
 David inquired of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to David, “Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023003" id="023003" >3</span>
 But David’s men said to him, “Behold we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023004" id="023004" >4</span>
 Then David inquired of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  yet again. And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered him, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023005" id="023005" >5</span>
 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle, inflicting heavy losses on them. In this way David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009023006" id="023006" >6</span>
 When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023007" id="023007" >7</span>
 When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has sold him into my hand, for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023008" id="023008" >8</span>
 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023009" id="023009" >9</span>
 When David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring here the ephod.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023010" id="023010" >10</span>
 And David said, “ <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023011" id="023011" >11</span>
 Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.” And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, “He will come down.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023012" id="023012" >12</span>
 Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, “They will deliver you up.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023013" id="023013" >13</span>
 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and moving from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023014" id="023014" >14</span>
 So David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hill-country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him continually, but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  did not deliver him into his hand. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009023015" id="023015" >15</span>
 Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. At that time, he was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023016" id="023016" >16</span>
 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, came to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023017" id="023017" >17</span>
 He said to him, “Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you. This Saul my father well knows.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023018" id="023018" >18</span>
 The two of them made a covenant before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and David stayed in Horesha, and Jonathan returned home. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009023019" id="023019" >19</span>
 Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of Jeshimon? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023020" id="023020" >20</span>
 Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart’s desire, come down, and it will be our part to deliver him into the king’s hand.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023021" id="023021" >21</span>
 Then Saul said, “Blessed may you be of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for you have had compassion on me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023022" id="023022" >22</span>
 Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is very cunning. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023023" id="023023" >23</span>
 See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009023024" id="023024" >24</span>
 So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023025" id="023025" >25</span>
 When Saul and his men went to seek him, David found out and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard, he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023026" id="023026" >26</span>
 Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023027" id="023027" >27</span>
 when a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023028" id="023028" >28</span>
 So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. This is why they call that place the Rock of Divisions. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009023029" id="023029" >29</span>
 David went up from there, and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="024001">24</span> When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024002" id="024002" >2</span>
 So Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats’ Crags. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024003" id="024003" >3</span>
 He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave. And Saul went in to relieve himself, while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024004" id="024004" >4</span>
 The men of David said to him, “See this is the day of which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to you, ‘Behold, I give your enemy into your hand and you will do to him as you please.’” Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024005" id="024005" >5</span>
 But afterward David was seized with remorse because he had cut off Saul’s robe. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024006" id="024006" >6</span>
 He said to his men, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed, to lift my hand against him, since he is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024007" id="024007" >7</span>
 So David upbraided his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. When Saul rose from the cave and went on his way, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024008" id="024008" >8</span>
 David also rose after him and went from the cave and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king.” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the earth, and did obeisance. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024009" id="024009" >9</span>
 And David said to Saul, “Why did you listen to the words of the men who said, ‘See, David seeks to harm you?’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024010" id="024010" >10</span>
 Today your eyes see that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gave you into my hand in the cave, but I refused to kill you and had pity on you, and I said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024011" id="024011" >11</span>
 Moreover, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor guilt on my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are aiming to take my life. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024012" id="024012" >12</span>
 May the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  judge between me and you, but my hand will not be against you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024013" id="024013" >13</span>
 As runs the proverb of the ancients, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness. <br /> But my hand will not be raised against you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024014" id="024014" >14</span>
 After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024015" id="024015" >15</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  therefore be judge and decide between me and you and see and plead my cause and obtain justice for me from you.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009024016" id="024016" >16</span>
 Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this not your voice, my son David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024017" id="024017" >17</span>
 He said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024018" id="024018" >18</span>
 You have done great good to me in that today, when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024019" id="024019" >19</span>
 For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound? Therefore may the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  reward you richly for what you have done to me this day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024020" id="024020" >20</span>
 Now see, I know that you will surely be king, and that through you the kingdom of Israel will be established. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024021" id="024021" >21</span>
 Swear now therefore to me by the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009024022" id="024022" >22</span>
 So David took oath to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="025001">25</span> Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. <br /><br /> Then David arose and went into the Wilderness of Maon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025002" id="025002" >2</span>
 There was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025003" id="025003" >3</span>
 The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was sensible and beautiful, but the man was rough and ill-mannered. He was a Calebite. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025004" id="025004" >4</span>
 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025005" id="025005" >5</span>
 So he sent ten young men, saying, “Go up to Carmel and enter Nabal’s house and greet him in my name, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025006" id="025006" >6</span>
 and say to him and to his clan, ‘Peace be to you and your house and all that you have. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025007" id="025007" >7</span>
 Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not jeer at them, and nothing of theirs was missing all the while they were in Carmel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025008" id="025008" >8</span>
 Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a feast day. Give, therefore, whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025009" id="025009" >9</span>
 When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David and waited as directed. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025010" id="025010" >10</span>
 But Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Many are the slaves these days who break away, each from his master! 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025011" id="025011" >11</span>
 Should I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not where they came from?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025012" id="025012" >12</span>
 So David’s young men turned back on their way, and came and reported all these words to him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025013" id="025013" >13</span>
 And David said to his men, “Let every man buckle on his sword.” Each man buckled on his sword. And David also buckeled on his sword, and there went up after David about four hundred men while two hundred remained with the baggage. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025014" id="025014" >14</span>
 But one of the young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David has just sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025015" id="025015" >15</span>
 But the men have been very good to us and we have not been jeered at nor have we missed anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025016" id="025016" >16</span>
 They were a wall about us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025017" id="025017" >17</span>
 Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a base scoundrel that no one speak to him.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025018" id="025018" >18</span>
 Then Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five roasted sheep and five mesures of parched grain and a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on donkeys. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025019" id="025019" >19</span>
 She said to her young men, “Go on before me, I am coming after you.” But she said nothing about it to her husband Nabal. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025020" id="025020" >20</span>
 Just as she was riding on the donkey and coming down under cover of the mountain, David and his men were also coming down toward her, so that she met them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025021" id="025021" >21</span>
 Now David had said, “Surely for nothing did I guard all that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness, so that nothing of all that belongs to him was missing, for he has returned me evil for good. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025022" id="025022" >22</span>
 God do whatever he will to David, if I leave by daybreak of all who belong to him as much as a single man.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025023" id="025023" >23</span>
 When Abigail saw David, she alighted quickly from her donkey and fell on her face before David and bowed to the ground. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025024" id="025024" >24</span>
 She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me, my lord, upon me be the guilt. Only let your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your servant. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025025" id="025025" >25</span>
 Let not my lord pay any attention to that base scoundrel, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he, ‘Reckless Fool,’ is his name and folly is his master, but your maid-servant didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025026" id="025026" >26</span>
 Now my lord, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives and as you live, since the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has kept you from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering yourself by your own hand – and may your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal – 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025027" id="025027" >27</span>
 let this present, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025028" id="025028" >28</span>
 Forgive, I pray the trespass of your servant, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will certainly make for my lord a secure house, for my lord is fighting the wars of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and no evil will be found in you as long as you live. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025029" id="025029" >29</span>
 Should a man rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, but the lives of your enemies will he sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025030" id="025030" >30</span>
 When the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done to my lord all the good that he has promised you and has made you prince over Israel, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025031" id="025031" >31</span>
 then this will not be a qualm or a burden on the conscience of my lord, that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has delivered himself by his own hand. When the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gives prosperity to my lord, then remember your servant.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025032" id="025032" >32</span>
 David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025033" id="025033" >33</span>
 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you yourself, who have kept me this day from committing an act of bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025034" id="025034" >34</span>
 For as sure as the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from doing you harm, except you had quickly come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by daybreak so much as one man.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025035" id="025035" >35</span>
 So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and to her he said, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your advice, and granted your request.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025036" id="025036" >36</span>
 But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk, so that she did not tell him anything at all until day break. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025037" id="025037" >37</span>
 But then in the morning when the effects of the wine were gone from Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him and he became a stone. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025038" id="025038" >38</span>
 At the end of about ten days the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  struck Nabal, so that he died. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025039" id="025039" >39</span>
 Now when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who has avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil. The evil-doing of Nabal the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  brought back upon his own head.” Then David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025040" id="025040" >40</span>
 When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife,” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025041" id="025041" >41</span>
 She rose and bowed with her face to the earth and said, “See, your slave is willing to be a servant to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025042" id="025042" >42</span>
 Abigail quickly arose and mounted an donkey, and five maids followed as servants. So she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009025043" id="025043" >43</span>
 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009025044" id="025044" >44</span>
 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="026001">26</span> Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “David is hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026002" id="026002" >2</span>
 Accordingly Saul arose, and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand men of Israel, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026003" id="026003" >3</span>
 Saul encamped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah overlooking Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026004" id="026004" >4</span>
 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come there after him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026005" id="026005" >5</span>
 so he arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul lay within the barricade, and the people were encamped around about him. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009026006" id="026006" >6</span>
 Then David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026007" id="026007" >7</span>
 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026008" id="026008" >8</span>
 Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to strike him twice!” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026009" id="026009" >9</span>
 But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lay his hand upon the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed and be innocent?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026010" id="026010" >10</span>
 David said, “As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, either the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and be destroyed. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026011" id="026011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  forbid that I should lift my hand against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed, but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026012" id="026012" >12</span>
 So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul’s head and they departed. No man saw it of knew it neither did any awake, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had fallen upon them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009026013" id="026013" >13</span>
 Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026014" id="026014" >14</span>
 And David cried to the army and to Abner, the son of Ner, “Do you make no answer Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you that calls to the king?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026015" id="026015" >15</span>
 And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026016" id="026016" >16</span>
 This that you have done is not good. As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026017" id="026017" >17</span>
 Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026018" id="026018" >18</span>
 He said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026019" id="026019" >19</span>
 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it was men, cursed be they before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, saying, ‘Go serve other gods.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026020" id="026020" >20</span>
 Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away from the presence of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009026021" id="026021" >21</span>
 Then Saul said, “I have done wrong. Return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026022" id="026022" >22</span>
 And David answered, “There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026023" id="026023" >23</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will reward each man’s righteousness and fidelity, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’a anointed. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026024" id="026024" >24</span>
 Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009026025" id="026025" >25</span>
 Then Saul said to David, “Be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and will surely succeed!” So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place. </p><h6>David among the Philistines</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="027001">27</span> Then David said to himself, “I will be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027002" id="027002" >2</span>
 So David set out, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027003" id="027003" >3</span>
 David stayed with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027004" id="027004" >4</span>
 When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009027005" id="027005" >5</span>
 David Said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let a place in one of the towns in the open country be given me, that I may live there, for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027006" id="027006" >6</span>
 So Achish gave him Ziklag at that time, therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027007" id="027007" >7</span>
 The length of the time that David lived in the open country of the Philistines was a year and four months. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009027008" id="027008" >8</span>
 David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these tribes live in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027009" id="027009" >9</span>
 As often as David struck the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027010" id="027010" >10</span>
 When Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” David answered, “Against the Negreb of Judah”, or “against the Negreb of the Jerahmeelites”, or “against the Negreb of the Kenites.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027011" id="027011" >11</span>
 But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, “They might give information against us and say, ‘David has done this, or that.’” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the open country of the Philistines. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009027012" id="027012" >12</span>
 And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has brought himself into ill odor with his people Israel, therefore he will be my servant forever.” <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="028001">28</span> Now in those days the Philistines assembled their forces to make a campaign against Israel. Achish said to David, “You know thqt you must, together with your men,  go with me along with the forces.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028002" id="028002" >2</span>
 David said to Achish, “Good, you will now know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “I will make you my bodyguard from this time on.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009028003" id="028003" >3</span>
 Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had banished the mediums and magicians out of the land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028004" id="028004" >4</span>
 When the Philistines assembled and came and encamped in Shunem, Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028005" id="028005" >5</span>
 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart was filled with apprehension. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028006" id="028006" >6</span>
 Saul inquired of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028007" id="028007" >7</span>
 Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire through her.” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at Endor.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009028008" id="028008" >8</span>
 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, taking two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. He said, “Tell my future by consulting the dead, call up for me the one whom I name to you.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028009" id="028009" >9</span>
 The woman said to him, Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has banished the mediums and the magicians from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to put me to death?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028010" id="028010" >10</span>
 And Saul swore to her by the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, saying, “As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, no guilt will come upon you for this.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028011" id="028011" >11</span>
 Then the woman said, “Whom should I bring up to you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028012" id="028012" >12</span>
 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. The woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028013" id="028013" >13</span>
 The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028014" id="028014" >14</span>
 He said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the earth in respect. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009028015" id="028015" >15</span>
 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am in great trouble, for the Philistines are making war against me and God has turned from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have called you to tell me what I should do.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028016" id="028016" >16</span>
 And Samuel said, “Why do you ask of me when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has turned from you and become your adversary? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028017" id="028017" >17</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done to you as he declared by me, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028018" id="028018" >18</span>
 Because you did not heed the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done this thing to you today. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028019" id="028019" >19</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will deliver Israel into the power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will deliver the army of Israel into the power of the Philistines.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009028020" id="028020" >20</span>
 Then Saul fell at once at full length upon the earth and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel, and he had no strength in him, for he had not eaten bread during all the day and all the night. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028021" id="028021" >21</span>
 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, “Your servant has heeded your voice, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028022" id="028022" >22</span>
 Now therefore, listen also to the advice of your servant and let me set before you a morsel of meat, and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028023" id="028023" >23</span>
 But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman urged him, until he listened to their advice. So he rose from the earth and sat upon the couch. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028024" id="028024" >24</span>
 The woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and took flour and kneaded it and baked from it unleavened bread. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009028025" id="028025" >25</span>
 She set it before Saul and his servants and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="029001">29</span> The Philistines had assembled their forces at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029002" id="029002" >2</span>
 The lords of the Philistines were marching past, with hundreds and with thousands, and David and his men marched in the rear guard with Achish. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029003" id="029003" >3</span>
 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “This is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has now been with me two years, and I have found no fault in him from the time that he came over to me to the present.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029004" id="029004" >4</span>
 But the commanders of the Philistines were enraged against him, and said, “Send back the man so that he may return to the place where you have stationed him. Don’t let him go down with us to battle – he might become an adversary to us. How could this fellow better ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of our men? 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029005" id="029005" >5</span>
 Is this not the David of whom they sang responsively in the dances, saying, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Saul has slain his thousands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But David his ten thousands?” <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009029006" id="029006" >6</span>
 Then Achish called to David and said to him, “As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives, you are upright, and it is my desire that you should go out and fight with me, for I have found no evil in you from the time that you came to me to the present, but you are not regarded favorably by the lords. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029007" id="029007" >7</span>
 Therefore now return and go in peace, so that you do nothing to displease the lords of the Philistines.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029008" id="029008" >8</span>
 David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant fromt the day that I entered into your service to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029009" id="029009" >9</span>
 And Achish answered David, “I know that you are as good in my sight as a Messenger of God, but the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029010" id="029010" >10</span>
 Therefore now rise early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place where I have stationed you, and do not entertain any evil design in your heart, for you are good in my sight, but rise early in the morning and as soon as it is light, depart.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009029011" id="029011" >11</span>
 So David rose early, together with his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel. </p><h6>David returns</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="030001">30</span> Now when David and his men  on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South Country and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burnt it down, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030002" id="030002" >2</span>
 and had carried away captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030003" id="030003" >3</span>
 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030004" id="030004" >4</span>
 Then David and the people who were with him wept aloud until they were no longer able to weep. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030005" id="030005" >5</span>
 David’s two wives had been take captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030006" id="030006" >6</span>
 David was in great trouble, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the spirit of all the people was embittered, each for his sons and for his daughters. <br /><br /> David strengthened himself in reliance on the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  his God, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030007" id="030007" >7</span>
 and said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring here to me the ephod.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030008" id="030008" >8</span>
 David inquired of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, saying, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I pursue this marauding band? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I overtake them?” <br /> He answered him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Pursue, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you will surely overtake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will surely rescue.” <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030009" id="030009" >9</span>
 So David went, together with the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those who were left behind remained. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030010" id="030010" >10</span>
 But David pursued together with four hundred men, while two hundred remained behind, who were too faint to cross the Wadi Besor. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030011" id="030011" >11</span>
 They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him food to eat and water to drink, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030012" id="030012" >12</span>
 and they gave him a piece of fig cake, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and nights. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030013" id="030013" >13</span>
 David said to him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” He said “I am an Egyptian lad, an Amalekite’s servant, and my master abandoned me because three days ago I fell sick. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030014" id="030014" >14</span>
 We made a raid upon the South Country of the Cherethites and on that which belongs to Judah and upon the South Country of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned down.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030015" id="030015" >15</span>
 And David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?” He said, “Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030016" id="030016" >16</span>
 When he had brought him down, there they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, on account of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030017" id="030017" >17</span>
 And David struck them from twilight to the following evening in order to destroy them completely. None escaped except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030018" id="030018" >18</span>
 David recovered all the people whom the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030019" id="030019" >19</span>
 There was nothing missing, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken to themselves – David brought it all back. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030020" id="030020" >20</span>
 He took all the flocks and the herds and drove those animals before the people, and they said, “This is David’s spoil.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030021" id="030021" >21</span>
 Now when David came to the two hundred men, who had been too faint to follow him, so that he had to leave them behind at the Wadi Besor, they went out to meet David, and the people who were with him. When they came near to the people, he saluted them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030022" id="030022" >22</span>
 Then all the wicked and base scoundrels among the men who went with David began to say, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each, his wife and his children, that he may take them away and depart.” 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030023" id="030023" >23</span>
 But David said, No! My brothers, you must not do this with that which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given us – after he has preserved us and delivered the marauding band that came against us into our hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030024" id="030024" >24</span>
 Who will give heed to you in this matter? For: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As is the share of him who goes down into battle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So is the share of him who remains with the baggage. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They must share alike.” <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030025" id="030025" >25</span>
 From that time on he made it a statute and precedent in Israel to this day. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v009030026" id="030026" >26</span>
 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, “See! a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030027" id="030027" >27</span>
 to them who were in Bethel, in Ramoth in the South Country, in Jattir, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030028" id="030028" >28</span>
 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030029" id="030029" >29</span>
 in Carmel, in the cities of Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030030" id="030030" >30</span>
 in Hormah, Bor-ashan, in Athach, 
<span class="verse" rel="v009030031" id="030031" >31</span>
 in Hebron, and to those in all the places where David and his men had stayed. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="031001">31</span> Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009031002" id="031002" >2</span>
 The Philistines followed close after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
<span class="verse" rel="v009031003" id="031003" >3</span>
