{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
{\cf1 1}v 1 The messages of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, amember of the priestly order resident in Anathoth inthe district of Benjamin.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}A message came to him from Jehovah in thethirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}king of Judah; and (such messages) continued tocome to him in the days of Jehoiakim, the son ofJosiah, king of Judah, and up to the end of theeleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king ofJudah, when in the fifth month the people ofJerusalem were swept into exile.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}This is the message that came to me from Jehovah:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}"My thoughts were upon thee before I created thee,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And before thou wast born I had set thee apart,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And appointed thee unto the nations a prophet."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And thus I made answer:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"Alas! O Lord Jehovah, Behold!
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
I have no skill of speech, I am only a child."
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Then Jehovah made answer to me:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
"Do not plead thou art still but a child,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Thou must go wheresoever I send thee,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And say whatsoever I bid thee.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}Be not afraid at the sight of them,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
2 For I will be with thee to save thee."
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Thus spoke Jehovah; then with His outstretched hand
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
He touched my mouth and said to me:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"Herewith do I put My words in thy mouth,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Behold this day do I give thee authority
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Over the nations and over the kingdoms,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
To uproot and demolish, destroy and tear down,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
To upbuild and to plant."

\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 11}This further message came to me from Jehovah:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
"What seest thou there, Jeremiah?" (said the Voice).
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}"A branch of an almond tree," I answered. "Thou
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
hast seen truly," said Jehovah," for I am watching?
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
over My purpose, to perform it."

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Then there came to me a second message fromJehovah. "What seest thou now?" (said theVoice). "A boiling pot," I answered, "facing the
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 14}north." Then Jehovah said to me:
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
From the north shall disaster break forth
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Over all that inhabit the land.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}For I, saith Jehovah, do summon
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
The northern kingdoms all;

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Each king shall come and set hi throne
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
At the gates that lead into Jerusalem,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And against her encircling walls,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And against all the cities of Judah.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}I will utter My judgments against them
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Because of their wickedness;
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
For Me they have forsaken,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And to to other gods offered sacrifice,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
And bowed to the work of their hands.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 As}for thee, gird up thy loins,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Arise and declare unto them
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Whatsoever I command thee.
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
Let the sight of them not dismay thee,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Else I will dismay thee before them.

 {\super\cf2\fs24 18}As for Me, behold! This day

As a fortified city I make thee,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Then Israel belonged to Jehovah,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Thus saith Jehovah:

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
What wrong did your fathers discover in Me,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
That they went from Me afar,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
To follow after vanities,

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Till they, too, becane a vanity,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
 {\super\cf2\fs24 6}And never sought afer Jehovah,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
Who brought them up out of Egypt,

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
And led them through the desert,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2080\li2800
A land of steppes and pits,
\par}

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
A land of drought and gloom,

And made Mine inheritance loathsome,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 8}No priest was heard any more

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They that handle the law did not know Me,

Me they have forsaken,

 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}And why are his cities wasted?

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800

{\pard\fi-2440\li2800
They have made his land all desolate,

Say, Listen tothis message from Jehovah, all ye men of Judah that {\super\cf2\fs24 3}enter these gates to worship Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your waysand your doings, and I will guarantee this place as your {\super\cf2\fs24 4}permanent home. But put no trust in lying messen-gers, who say: "This is the Temple of Jehovah, the {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah." For ifyou really amend your ways and your doings: ifyou really do justice as between man and man; {\super\cf2\fs24 6}if you abstain from the oppression of the residentalien, the fatherless and the widow, from the shed-ding of innocent blood in this place, and from devotion {\super\cf2\fs24 7}to other gods to your own hurt, then I will guaranteeyou a home here for all time in the land that I gaveyour forefathers.

What! you committheft, murder, adultery, perjury, you burn sacrificeto the Baal, you run after other gods that are {\super\cf2\fs24 10}strange to you; and then you (have the hardihoodto) come and stand before me in this House which iscalled by My name, and say, "Now we are safe" \uc1\u8211* inorder, forsooth, to carry on all these abominations. {\super\cf2\fs24 11}This House which bears My name you regard, do you,as nothing but a robbers\uc1\u8217* cave?

And so it will be now, saith Jehovah. Becauseyou have perpetrated all these anormities, in defianceof My most earnest and repeated words, and have {\super\cf2\fs24 14}refused to respond to My call, therefore this Templein which you repose your trust \uc1\u8211* called by My namethough it be \uc1\u8211* and the place that I gave to you andyour forefathers, I will consign to the same fate as {\super\cf2\fs24 15}overtook Shiloh; and I will hurl you out of My sightas I have hurled your brethren, the whole race ofEphraim.

Mark this,therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah, when thisplace shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valleyof the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; {\super\cf2\fs24 7}and I will spill upon the ground the wisdom of Judahand Jerusalem in this place.

It may be thatthey will listen and severally abandon their wickedways: if they do, I will relent and not bring upon themthe calamity I am planning as penalty for their evil {\super\cf2\fs24 4}behaviour. This, then, is what thou art to say tothem, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye refuse to obey Me\uc1\u8211*to live in accordance with the law that I have set before {\super\cf2\fs24 5}you, and to listen, as ye have never yet listened, to thewords of My servants the prophets, whom early and {\super\cf2\fs24 6}late I have been sending to you \uc1\u8211* then I will make thisTemple like Shiloh, and as for this city, I will turn itinto an object of execration to every nation in the world.

"Thisman." they said, "is guilty of a capital offence; forhe has solemnly declared that this city is doomed\uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}you have heard him with your own ears. ThenJeremiah in his turn addressed himself to the courtiersand to the whole body of the people.

 {\cf1 32}The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah{\super\cf2\fs24 1}in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which {\super\cf2\fs24 2}was in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At thattime the forces of the king of Babylon were investingJerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined to {\super\cf2\fs24 3}the guard-house of the royal palace, where Zedekiah theking had shut him up on account of his propheticpreaching. "What do you mean," he had demanded,"by an announcement of this kind: \uc1\u8217*Thus saithJehovah, Depend upon it, I will give this city into thehands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it. {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Nor shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape the hands ofthe Chaldeans; he will assuredly be delivered into thehands of the king of Babylon.

And so it happened: my cousinHanamel paid me in the guard-house the visit Jehovahhad intimated, and said: "I want you to buy the landI possess at Anathoth; for you are the legal heir, andit is your duty to secure it \uc1\u8211* so buy it for yourself."Then I recognised that the message I had received was {\super\cf2\fs24 9}really from Jehovah. So I bought the land at Anathothfrom my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the money {\super\cf2\fs24 10}to him \uc1\u8211* seventeen silver shekels. Then I signed thedeed and sealed it, took witnesses, and paid him the {\super\cf2\fs24 11}money in full. I then took the purchase-deed\uc1\u8211*the one which was sealed and the one which was open\uc1\u8211* {\super\cf2\fs24 12}and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son ofMachesiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, andof the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deed {\super\cf2\fs24 13}and of all the Jews in the guard-house. In theirpresence I then gave these instructions to Baruch: {\super\cf2\fs24 14}"Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Take these deeds \uc1\u8211* this purchase deed which is sealedand this deed which is open \uc1\u8211* and put them in anearthenware jar, so that they may be preserved for a {\super\cf2\fs24 15}long time to come.

But you have in these daysacted in a very different spirit; you have done whatI desired in each proclaiming liberty to his (enslaved)neighbour; in My presence you made a covenant {\super\cf2\fs24 16}in the House that is called by My name. Now,however, you have turned round and dishonoured Myname by forcing back again into slavery the severalmale and female slaves you had set free to dispose ofthemselves as they would.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 35}In the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of{\super\cf2\fs24 1}Judah, Jeremiah received the following message from {\super\cf2\fs24 2}Jehovah: Go to the clan of the Rechabites, talk withthem, bring them into one of the chambers (of the {\super\cf2\fs24 3}Temple) and offer them wine to drink. So I tookJaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaz-ziniah, with his brothers and all his sons and the whole {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Rechabite clan, and brought them into the Templechamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, the son ofYigdaliah, the man of God, that was adjacent to thechamber of the princes, above the chamber ofMaaseiah, the son of Shallum, the Keeper of the {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Threshold. I then set before the Rechabites bowls {\super\cf2\fs24 6}full of wine and cups and told them to drink. "No,"they said, "we will drink no wine; for Jonadab, theson of Rechab, our ancestor, laid a charge upon us and {\super\cf2\fs24 7}our children to drink no wine, to build no houses, to sowno seed, to plant and possess no vineyard for ever, but tospend all our days in tents, so that we might live long on {\super\cf2\fs24 8}the land where as strangers we dwell. In full obedience,therefore, to this charge of Jonadab, the son of Rechab,our ancestor, we have drunk no wine all our life long,neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our {\super\cf2\fs24 9}daughters. We have built no houses to live in, we {\super\cf2\fs24 10}have owned neither vineyard, field, nor seed, butwe have lived in tents and faithfully fulfilled all the {\super\cf2\fs24 11}instructions of our ancestors Jonadab. It was onlywhen the land was invaded by Nebuchadrezzar, kingof Babylon, that we decided to come to Jerusalem, toescape the Babylonian and Aramean armies; that iswhy we are (now) living in Jerusalem."

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 12}Then there came to Jeremiah this message from {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Jehovah: "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel:Go and say to the men of Judah and the citizens ofJerusalem: Should this not be a lesson to you to obey {\super\cf2\fs24 14}My words, saith Jehovah? The injunction thatJonadab the son of Rechab laid upon his sons todrink no wine has been steadily observed: in obedienceto that ancestral charge they have abstained to this day.But when I spoke to you early and late, you refused {\super\cf2\fs24 15}to listen. Early and late I sent you all My servants theprophets with the message to each man of you that, ifyou would abandon your wicked ways, amend yourconduct, and no longer indulge in the service of othergods, you should continue in the land that I gave yourforefathers; but you would not incline your ear or {\super\cf2\fs24 16}listen to Me. Unlike the descendants of Jonadab theson of Rechab, who have steadily observed the in-junctions of their ancestor, this people has refused to {\super\cf2\fs24 17}listen to Me. Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,the God of Israel: See! I am about to bring uponJudah and upon all the citizens of Jerusalem all themisery with which I have threatened them, becausethey refused to listen to My words or respond to My {\super\cf2\fs24 18}call." But to the clan of the Rechabites Jeremiah said,"Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Because you have obeyed the injunction of yourancestor Jonadab, keeping all his commandments and {\super\cf2\fs24 19}fulfiling all his instructions, Jonadab, the son of Rechabshall never want a man to minister to Me, while theearth stands.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 36}In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah,{\super\cf2\fs24 1}king of Judah, Jeremiah received the following message {\super\cf2\fs24 2}from Jehovah: Take a book-roll, and write on it allthe messages I have communicated to thee with regardto Israel and Judah and all nations, from My firstmessage to thee in the days of Josiah right on to the {\super\cf2\fs24 3}present day. It may be that, when the people ofJudah hear of all the misery I am planning to bringupon them, they will severally abandon their wickedways, and receive at My hands pardon for their guiltand sin.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Then Jeremiah summoned Baruch, the son of Neriah,who wrote down on a book-roll to Jeremiah\uc1\u8217*s dic-tation all the messages Jehovah had communicated to {\super\cf2\fs24 5}him. Thereafter Jeremiah gave instructions toBaruch in the following terms: "Seeing that I ampersonally under restraint and debarred from access {\super\cf2\fs24 6}to the Temple, do you go and, on the day appointedfor fasting, read aloud in the Temple the messages ofJehovah in the hearing of the people from the rollwhich you have written to my dictation; read themalso in the hearing of the Judeans who come from their {\super\cf2\fs24 7}respective country towns. It may be that they willhumbly supplicate Jehovah, and severally abandontheir wicked ways: for great is the anger and fury {\super\cf2\fs24 8}with which Jehovah has threatened this people." Inaccordance, therefore with his instructions fromJeremiah the prophet, Baruch read aloud from thebook the words of Jehovah in the Temple.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakimthe son of Josiah, king of Judah, a sacred fast wasproclaimed by all the people resident in Jerusalem,and all those also present from the country towns of {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Judah. Then in the hearing of all the people Baruchread from the book the messages of Jeremiah from theroom that belonged to Gemariah, the son of Shaphanthe Secretary of State, which was situated in the upper {\super\cf2\fs24 11}court at the entrance to the new Temple gate. Nowwhen Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son ofShaphan, had heard the messages of Jehovah as they {\super\cf2\fs24 12}were read from the book, he went down to the palaceto the room of the Secretary of State, and there he foundthe whole court seated \uc1\u8211* Elishama, the Secretary andDelaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elanthan, theson of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, andZedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and indeed the whole {\super\cf2\fs24 13}court. Micaiah proceeded to inform them of all thewords he had heard Baruch read out of the book in the {\super\cf2\fs24 14}hearing of the people. The whole court accordinglydespatched a messenger to Baruch, namely one Jehudi,the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son ofCushi, with instructions to Baruch to appear, bring-ing with him the roll from which he had read in thehearing of the people. So Baruch, the son of Neriah,appeared before them with the roll in his hand.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 15}Then they told him to sit down and read it in their {\super\cf2\fs24 16}hearing; so Baruch read while they listened. Whenthey had heard it all, they turned to one another inconsternation, exclaiming to Baruch that they were {\super\cf2\fs24 17}bound to inform the king of all this. They thenasked Baruch to explain how he had written all these {\super\cf2\fs24 18}words. Baruch replied that Jeremiah had dictatedthem all to him, and he had written them down with {\super\cf2\fs24 19}ink in the book. "Well, then," said the princes toBaruch, "go into hiding, you and Jeremiah, and let {\super\cf2\fs24 20}nobody know where you are." After they haddeposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama theSecretary, they visited the king in his apartment,and reported the whole matter to him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 21}The king then despatched Jehudi to fetch the roll;and, when he had brought it form Elishama\uc1\u8217*s chamber,he read it in the hearing of the king and of all the {\super\cf2\fs24 22}courtiers who were in attendance upon him. Nowthe king was sitting in the winter house, and the {\super\cf2\fs24 23}fire on the brazier was burning before him; andevery three or four columns that Jehudi read, the kingwould cut up with his penknife and fling into the firethat was on the brazier, till the whole roll was con- {\super\cf2\fs24 24}sumed in the fire that was on the brazier. But therewas no sense of horror either on the part of the kingor of any of his ministers as they listened to all these {\super\cf2\fs24 25}words, nor did they rend their garments. Elnathan,Delaiah, and Gemariah, however, had entreated theking not to burn the roll, but he would not listen to {\super\cf2\fs24 26}them. Then the king commanded the royal princeJerachmeel, and seraiah, the son of Azriel, andShelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribeand Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah kept them inconcealment.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 27}After the king had burned the roll containing thewords written by Baruch to Jeremiah\uc1\u8217*s dictation, {\super\cf2\fs24 28}Jeremiah received this message from Jehovah, "Oncemore take another roll, and write on it all the wordsthat were on the first roll that was consigned to the {\super\cf2\fs24 29}flames by Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Thus saithJehovah: Thou hast taken it upon thee to burn thisroll and to demand my reason for recording the threatthat the king of Babylon would assuredly come and {\super\cf2\fs24 30}destroy this land, and clear it of man and beast. There-fore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king ofJudah: Never a man shall he have to sit upon thethrone of David; his dead body shall be flung out and {\super\cf2\fs24 31}exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night.

"It is false, said Jeremiah, "I amnot deserting to the Chaldeans."

 {\cf1 40}The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah{\super\cf2\fs24 1}after he had been released from Ramah by Nebuzar-adan, the commander of the guard, who had found himthere in chains among the captives of Jerusalem andJudah, who were being carried to exile in Babylon.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 2}The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and saidto him: "Jehovah, your God, pronounced this doom {\super\cf2\fs24 3}upon this place, and He has kept His word. Youhave sinned against Him and refused to listen to His {\super\cf2\fs24 4}voice, and so this thing is come upon you. But see now,I will release you at once from the chains on your hands.If you are disposed to accompany me to Babyloncome and I will look well after you; but if not, thenleave it alone. The whole land is before you; go {\super\cf2\fs24 5}wherever you choose and prefer. Go back to Gedaliah,the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the kingof Babylon has appointed Governor of the cities ofJudah: stay with him among the people or go whereveryou choose." Then the commander of the guarddismissed him with a gift of provisions and a present. {\super\cf2\fs24 6}So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah at Mizpah, where hestayed with him among the people left in the land.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}When all the commanders of the forces in the openfield, together with their men, heard that the king ofBabylon had appointed Gedaliah Governor of the land,and charged him with the oversight of the men, womenand children, and of the poorest of the land, such as {\super\cf2\fs24 8}had not been carried to exile in Babylon, they camewith their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah \uc1\u8211* Ishmael theson of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons ofKareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons ofEphai of Netophah, and Jezaniah, the son of the {\super\cf2\fs24 9}Maacathite. And Gedaliah gave his oath to them andtheir men: "Don\uc1\u8217*t be afraid," he said, "of theChaldean officials. You will prosper if you stay in the {\super\cf2\fs24 10}land and serve the king of Babylon. As for myself,I will reside at Mizpah, to represent your interestswhen the Chaldean (officials) visit us; and you cangather wine, fruit, and oil, and store them up and live {\super\cf2\fs24 11}in the towns you take possession of." Further, all theJews that were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, or elsewhere,when they heard that the king of Babylon had grantedpermission to some to remain in Judah and had ap- {\super\cf2\fs24 12}pointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Governor, theyall returned to Judah from all the places to which theyhad been driven \uc1\u8211* to Gedaliah at Mizpah \uc1\u8211* and theygathered immense stores of wine and fruit.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 13}Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the com-manders of the forces in the open field came to Gedaliah {\super\cf2\fs24 14}at Mizpah, and asked him whether he was awarethat Baalis king of Ammon had sent Ishmael the son ofNethaniah to assasiante him. But Gedaliah would {\super\cf2\fs24 15}not believe it. Then Johanan, in a secret audience withGedaliah at Mizpah, said to him: "I beseech you toallow me to go and slay Ishmael. Nobody need know.Why should he take your life? that will mean thescattering of all the Jews that have gathered round {\super\cf2\fs24 16}you, and the ruin of all that is left of Judah." "No,"said Gedaliah to Johanan, "do nothing of the kind:what you say of Ishmael is not true." 
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\cf1 41}In the seventh month, however, Ishamael, the son{\super\cf2\fs24 1}of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, a member of theroyal family, accompanied by one of the chief officers ofthe king and ten (other) men, paid a visit to Gedaliah {\super\cf2\fs24 2}at Mizpah. While they were all dining together there,Ishmael and the ten men who accompanied him roseand with the sword smote and slew Gedaliah, whom theking of Babylon had appointed Governor of the land, {\super\cf2\fs24 3}together with all the Jews who were with him inMizpah and all the Chaldean soldiers who happenedto be there.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 4}The day after the murder of Gedaliah, of which no {\super\cf2\fs24 5}one was yet aware, eighty pilgrims from Shechem,Shiloh, and Samaria, with beards shaven, clothes rentand gashes (on their bodies), came with vegetable offer-ings and frankincense in their hand to present them at {\super\cf2\fs24 6}the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went out from Mizpahto meet them, and they were weeping as they wentalong. When he meet them, he invited them to come to {\super\cf2\fs24 7}Gedaliah; but when they were well within the town,he and the men who accompanied him slew them at {\super\cf2\fs24 8}the cistern. Ten of their number, however, entreatedIshmael not to kill them: "for we have stores ofwheat," they said, "and barley, oil, and honey, buriedin the ground." So he let them alone and did not {\super\cf2\fs24 9}consign them to the doom of their brethren. Nowthe cistern into which Ishmael had cast all the corpsesof the men he had slain was the great cistern whichhad been constructed by king Asa in his war againstBaasha, king of Israel; and this Ishmael filled with theslain.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 10}Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of thepeople that were at Mizpah, the princesses and all thepeople left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the com-mander of the guard, had committed to the charge ofGedaliah, the son of Ahikam; and he started across to {\super\cf2\fs24 11}Ammon. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, andall the commanders of the forces that were with him, {\super\cf2\fs24 12}heard of all the atrocities perpetrated by Ishmael, theytook all their men and set out to attack him; and they {\super\cf2\fs24 13a}found him by the great waters of Gibeon. All the {\super\cf2\fs24 14a}people with Ishmael \uc1\u8211* all that he had carried captive {\super\cf2\fs24 13b}from Mizpah \uc1\u8211* when they saw Johanan and the com-manders of the forces that were with him, were filled {\super\cf2\fs24 14b}with joy; and turning about, they came back and {\super\cf2\fs24 15}joined Johanan. But Ishmael, escaping with eightmen, repaired to Ammon.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 16}Then Johanan and all the commanders of the forcesthat were with him, tool all the rest of the people whomIshmael had carried away captive from Mizpah, afterhis assassination of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam \uc1\u8211* men,women, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from {\super\cf2\fs24 17}Gibeon. Then they took their journey and stayedawhile at the sheepfolds of Chimham in the neighbour-hood of Bethlehem, from which they intended to {\super\cf2\fs24 18}travel to Egypt; for they were in terror of theChaldeans, because Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah,whom the king of Babylon had appointed Governor ofthe land.

  {\cf1 42}Then all the commanders of the forces, together{\super\cf2\fs24 1}with Johanan, and Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and {\super\cf2\fs24 2}all the people great and small, approached Jeremiahthe prophet with a petition, which they commended tohis most favourable consideration, that he would prayfor them, remnant as they were, to Jehovah his God."We are left," they said, "but a few out of many, as {\super\cf2\fs24 3}you see with your own eyes. Let Jehovah your Godtell us the way we should go and the things we should do." {\super\cf2\fs24 4}Jeremiah replied, "I have heard you; I promise topray to Jehovah our God, as you request; and what-ever be Jehovah\uc1\u8217*s answer I will tell you unreservedly." {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Whereupon they said to Jeremiah, "Jehovah be ourtrue and faithful Witness that we will act entirely inaccordance with any message that Jehovah your God {\super\cf2\fs24 6}may send us.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 7}After an interval of ten days, Jeremiah received a {\super\cf2\fs24 8}message from Jehovah. He accordingly summonedJohanan and all the commanders of the forces thatwere with him, and all the people, small and great, {\super\cf2\fs24 9}and thus he addressed them. "Thus saith Jehovah,the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your {\super\cf2\fs24 10}supplication: If you remain quitely in this land, I willbuild you up and not throw you down; I will plant youand not pluck you up: for I am grieved at the misery {\super\cf2\fs24 11}I have brought upon you. You are afraid of the king ofBabylon, but do not be afraid of him, saith Jehovah;do not be afraid of him, for I will be with you, to save {\super\cf2\fs24 12}you and to deliver you from his hand. I will havepity upon you and inspire him with pity for you, sothat he will allow you to remain in your own land. {\super\cf2\fs24 13}You may, however, disregard the voice of Jehovah your {\super\cf2\fs24 14}God, and refuse to remain in this land: you may say,\uc1\u8217*No; we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shallsee no war and hear no sound of trumpet and neversuffer for lack of bread \uc1\u8211* and there we shall make our {\super\cf2\fs24 15}home.\uc1\u8217* In that case I call upon you that are left ofJudah to listen to the message of Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you are reallydetermined to proceed to Egypt, and if you go and settle {\super\cf2\fs24 16}there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake youthere in the land of Egypt, and the hunger that youdread shall cling to your heels there in Egypt, and there {\super\cf2\fs24 17}ye shall die; and all the men that were determinedto go and settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, famine,and pestilence; not one shall survive or escape the dis- {\super\cf2\fs24 18}aster that I will bring upon them. For thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine angerand fury have been poured out upon the inhabitants ofJerusalem, so shall My fury be poured out upon youwhen ye enter Egypt; and ye shall be an object ofexecration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and yeshall see this place no more.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi720 
 {\super\cf2\fs24 19}This is Jehovah\uc1\u8217*s message to you that are left ofJudah: \uc1\u8217*Do not go to Egypt.\uc1\u8217* But now be very sure {\super\cf2\fs24 20}of this \uc1\u8211* I this day lay witness against you; you havedone yourselves a grievous wrong. You have sentme to Jehovah your God with the request that I shouldpray for you to Jehovah, and promising to act inentire accordance with the will of Jehovah when I {\super\cf2\fs24 21}declared it to you; but when I did declare it this day,you refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah in respect {\super\cf2\fs24 22}of any part of my commission.

 {\cf1 43}When Jeremiah had finished addressing to the{\super\cf2\fs24 1}assembled people all these words with which Jehovah {\super\cf2\fs24 2}had commissioned him, Azariah, the son of Hoshaniah,and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the defiant andinsolent men exclaimed to Jeremiah, "You are a liar;you have no commission to us from Jehovah to warn {\super\cf2\fs24 3}us against going and settling in Egypt; but it is Baruchthe son of Neriah who is setting you on against us withthe object of delivering us into the hands of theChaldeans, to be killed or transported to Babylon." {\super\cf2\fs24 4}So Johanan and all the commanders of the forces andall the people refused to listen to the voice of Jehovahwhich urged them to remain in the land of Judah. {\super\cf2\fs24 5}Accordingly Johanan and all the commanders of theforces took all that were now left of Judah \uc1\u8211* those thathad come back from all the nations to which they had {\super\cf2\fs24 6}been driven, to settle in the land of Judah \uc1\u8211* the men,the women, the princesses, and all the persons whomNebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had leftin the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the sonof Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch {\super\cf2\fs24 7}the son of Neriah; and, disregarding the voice ofJehovah, they went to Egypt and arrived at Daphnae.

But they refusedto listen or incline their ear: they would no abandon {\super\cf2\fs24 6}their wickedness or cease sacrificing to other gods.
