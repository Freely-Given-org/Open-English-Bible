##### The Open English Bible #####

The Open English Bible project aims to create a modern English translation of the Bible which is completely free of copyright restrictions and available without cost for any purpose.

The OEB is your Bible — you can use it in worship, print as many copies as you want (in whole or part), republish it on your own website, even remix it or take it as the base for your own translation to meet your needs and the needs of your community. And you can do this without needing our permission or paying us a cent (or penny, rupee or kobo).

##### Base texts #####

The normative text for the OEB New Testament is the Westcott & Hort critical text. Since the NA28 is subject to a claim of copyright, W&H remains the best available public domain text.

The normative text for the OEB Old Testament is the Codex Leningradensis (Leningrad Codex); specifically the electronic version of the Westminster Leningrad Codex. 

The OEB is being created by taking existing English language translations which are in the public domain, and conforming them to modern English and suitable public domain Greek and Hebrew source texts.p The New Testament of the OEB is being formed on the base of the “Twentieth Century New Testament”, in particular the revised edition published in 1904. The Old Testament books which have been completed at this stage lean heavily on the work of John Edgar McFadyen and Charles Foster Kent, both of whom were very respected turn of the century Old Testament scholars.p The TCNT was one of the earliest 20th century attempts at a translation in clear modern language aimed at the ordinary reader and based on a modern textual base (ie Westcott & Hort). Predating the mid-20th century translations such as the New English Bible and even Moffatt’s groundbreaking attempt, it is out of copyright worldwide. The TCNT also has a particular resonance with the open source and free content communities of today - it was created by a loose collaboration of volunteers rather than a top-down hierarchy. Given the requirements of modern language and public domain status the TCNT was the best contender.

##### Copyright #####

The OEB is available under a CC0 licence, effectively a waiver of copyright which allows the maximum reuse. We request (though this is not a licence condition) that altered versions be distributed under another name, or with changes clearly and comprehensively disclosed so that readers are not confused.

Genesis

 [Genesis 1] 

##### Creation #####

|  [1:1] In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
|    [1:2] the earth was still unformed and chaotic,
|    with darkness on the surface of the abyss,
|    and the spirit of God hovering over the waters.
|    [1:3] God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
|    [1:4] God saw that the light was good.
|    He separated the light from the darkness,
|    [1:5] calling the light ’day’ and the darkness ’night’.
|  There was an evening and a morning, making the first day.

|  [1:6] Then God said, “Let there be a dome between the waters,
|    and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
|    [1:7] So God made the dome to separate the waters below
|    from the waters which were above it.
|      It was so.
|    [1:8] God called the dome the ’sky’.
|  There was an evening and a morning, making the second day.

|  [1:9] Then God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together,
|    and let the dry ground appear.”
|      It was so.
|    [1:10] God called the dry ground ’land’
|    and he called the gathered waters ’seas’.
|      God saw that it was good.

|  [1:11] God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation:
|    Plants on the earth which yield their own kind of seed,
|    and trees that bear fruits in which are their own seed.”
|      It was so.
|    [1:12] The earth sprouted vegetation:
|    seed-bearing plants,
|    and trees with seed-bearing fruit.
|      God saw that it was good.
|  [1:13] There was an evening and a morning, making the third day.

|  [1:14] Then God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky
|    to separate the night from the day.
|    Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years.
|    [1:15] Let them be lights in the dome of the sky to light the earth.”
|      It was so.
|    [1:16] So God made the two great lights:
|    The greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night.

|  God made the stars also.[1:17] He placed all these lights in the dome of the sky
|    to shed light upon the earth,
|    [1:18] to rule over the day and over the night,
|    and to separate light from darkness.
|      God saw that it was good.
|  [1:19] There was an evening and a morning, making the fourth day.

|  [1:20] Then God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures,
|    and let birds fly over the earth in the open dome of the sky.”
|    [1:21] God created the great sea monsters,
|    all kinds of living, moving creatures with which the waters teem,
|    and all kinds of winged birds.
|      God saw that it was good.
|    [1:22] He blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful,
|    increase, fill the oceans,
|    and let the birds increase on the land.”
|  [1:23] There was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day.

|  [1:24] Then God said, “Let the earth produce all kinds of living creatures:
|    cattle and reptiles and wild beasts.”
|      It was so.
|    [1:25] So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts,
|    and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground.
|      God saw that it was good.

|  [1:26] Then God said, “Let us make humans who are images of us, who are like us.
|    Let them rule over the fish of the sea,
|    the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts,
|    and all the reptiles that crawl upon the ground.”
|    [1:27] So God created humans in his image,
|      he created them in the image of God.
|    He created them male and female.

|  [1:28] Then God blessed them, and said to them:
|    “Be fruitful, grow in number,
|    fill the earth and govern it;
|    rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky,
|    and over every living thing that crawls on the ground,”

|  [1:29] God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant
|    throughout all the earth,
|    and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit.
|    They will be food for you,
|    [1:30] and to every wild beast and to every bird of the sky,
|    and to everything that crawls on the earth -
|    everything with the breath of life in it,
|    I give every green plant for food.”
|      It was so.
|    [1:31] When God saw all that he had made,
|    he perceived that it was very good.
|  There was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day.

 [Genesis 2] 

|  [2:1] So the heavens and the earth were finished, and everything in them.
|    [2:2] When on the seventh day God finished the work which he had done,
|    he rested that day from all his work.
|    [2:3] God blessed the seventh day and set it apart,
|    for in it he rested from all the creative work which he had done.

##### The garden #####

[2:4] This is the story of the heavens and earth when they were created.

At the time when the LORD  God made earth and heaven,[2:5] there were not yet any plants on the earth, and no vegetation had sprung up; for the LORD  God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the soil.[2:6] A mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground.

[2:7] Then the LORD  God molded a human being out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living being.[2:8] The LORD  God planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and placed the human he had formed there.[2:9] From the soil the LORD  God made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food, with the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil.

[2:10] A river flowed out of Eden and watered the garden, and from there branched into four.[2:11] The name of the first is Pishon, which flows round the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.[2:12] The gold of that land is pure and there is aromatic gum and the onyx stone.[2:13] The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows around the whole land of Cush,[2:14] and the name of the third river is the Tigris, which heads toward the east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.

[2:15] Then the LORD  God took the human and placed him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it.[2:16] The LORD  God also gave the human this command: “You may freely eat from every tree of the garden,[2:17] except from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you must not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”

[2:18] Then the LORD  God said, “It is not good for the human to be alone; I will make a helper suited to him.”[2:19] So out of the ground the LORD  God formed all the wild beasts and birds, and made them come to the human to see what he would call them. Whatever he called each living creature, that was its name.[2:20] So the human, Adam gave names to all cattle and all the wild birds and beasts. But there was no companion suitable for him.

[2:21] Then the LORD  God caused the human to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.[2:22] With the rib which he had taken from the human, the LORD  built up a woman and brought her to the human.[2:23] Then the human said, “This now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, for from man she was taken.”[2:24] For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two become one flesh.

[2:25] The man and his wife were both naked, yet felt no shame.

 [Genesis 3] 

[3:1] Now the snake was craftier than any other wild beast that the LORD  God had made. It said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the garden’?”[3:2] The woman answered, “We are allowed to eat the fruit of all the trees of the garden;[3:3] it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God has said, ‘You must not eat from it, nor should you touch it, for if you do, you will die.’”[3:4] Then the snake said to the woman, “You will not die![3:5] God knows that on the day you eat some of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing what is good and what is evil.”

[3:6] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, attractive to look at and desirable for acquiring wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.

[3:7] Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked, so they sewed fig-leaves together to cover themselves.[3:8] But when they heard the sound of the LORD  God walking in the garden in the evening breeze, the man and his wife hid from him among the garden trees.

[3:9] When the LORD  God called to the man, “Where are you?”[3:10] he replied, “I heard you in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.”[3:11] The LORD  God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree from which I ordered you not to eat?”[3:12] The man answered, “The woman you placed beside me, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.”[3:13] The LORD  God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman replied, “The snake deceived me, and I ate.”

[3:14] Then the LORD  God said to the snake:

|  “Because you have done this,
|  you will be more accursed than all cattle
|  and all the wild beasts.
|  You will crawl on your belly
|  and eat dust
|  all your life.
|  [3:15] I will establish hostility between you and the woman,
|  between your offspring and hers,
|  who will wound your head,
|  and you will wound their heel.”

[3:16] To the woman he said,

|  “I will greatly increase your anguished toil in pregnancy;
|  with pain will you bear children.
|  
|  You will yearn for your husband,
|  but he will rule over you.”

[3:17] To Adam he said,

|  “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife,
|  and ate from the tree
|  about which I ordered you:
|  ’You must never eat from it’
|  the ground will be cursed because of you;
|  as long as you live, you will earn a living only by anguished toil.

|  [3:18] The ground will always bring forth thorns and thistles,
|  and you will eat the plants of the field.
|  [3:19] By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread,
|  until you return to the ground,
|  for from it you were taken;
|  for dust you are,
|  and to dust you will return!”

[3:20] The man, Adam, named his wife Eve^[ Heb Havvah, that is, Life.]; because she was the mother of all living people.[3:21] The LORD  God made clothes from animal skins for Adam and his wife and dressed them.

[3:22] Then the LORD  God said: “The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not reach out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.”[3:23] So the LORD  God sent him out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken.[3:24] He drove out Adam and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the blazing whirling sword, to bar the way to the tree of life.        

 [Genesis 4] 

##### Cain and Abel #####

[4:1] Adam lay with his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have created a man with the help of the LORD !”[4:2] She also gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, while Cain was a farmer.

[4:3] In the course of time Cain brought some of the ground’s produce as an offering to the LORD .[4:4] Abel too brought some of the choicest animals of his flock and sacrificed their fat pieces. The LORD  looked with approval on Abel and his offering[4:5] but he could not receive Cain and his offering with approval.

Cain burned with anger and his face fell.[4:6] So the LORD  said to Cain, “Why are you angry and why do you scowl?[4:7] If you do what is right and good, can’t you hold your head up high? But if you do wrong, sin crouches at the door and longs to have you, but you must master it.”

[4:8] Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go into the field.” While they were there, Cain attacked his brother and killed him.

[4:9] Then the LORD  asked Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He answered, “I do not know! Am I my brother’s keeper?”

[4:10] “What have you done?” the LORD  replied, “Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.[4:11] Even now you are cursed by the very ground that has opened to receive your brother’s blood shed by your hand.[4:12] From now on when you till the ground, it will no longer yield its best to you. You will be a vagabond and a wandering refugee upon the earth.”

[4:13] Then Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is too much for me to bear.[4:14] Look! Today you banish me from the ground. I must hide in your presence. I will be a wandering refugee upon the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me!”

[4:15] But the LORD  said to him, “If any one kills you, the crime shall be avenged sevenfold.” So the LORD  placed a distinctive mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him.[4:16] Cain departed from the LORD ’s presence and lived east of Eden in the land of Wandering.

##### Genealogy #####

[4:17] Cain lay with his wife. She became pregnant, giving birth to Enoch. Cain built a city, and named it after his son Enoch.[4:18] To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

##### Lamech’s vengence #####

[4:19] Lamech took two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.[4:20] Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the ancestor of the people who live in tents and have cattle.[4:21] His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of the people who play the harp and flute.[4:22] As for Zillah, she gave birth to Tubal-cain, who forged all sort of tools from copper and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

[4:23] Lamech said to his wives:

|  “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
|    wives of Lamech, listen to my speech;
|  because I have slain a man for wounding me,
|    and a young man for bruising me.
|  [4:24] If Cain is to be avenged sevenfold,
|    then Lamech will be seventy and sevenfold.”

##### Genealogy #####

[4:25] Adam lay with his wife again and she bore a son. She named him Seth: “because God gave me another son for Abel, who was killed by Cain.”[4:26] Seth too had a son. He named him Enosh. That was when people began worshipping in the name of LORD .

 [Genesis 5] 

[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Adam. On the day that God created human beings, he made them in his own image.[5:2] He created them male and female created, and blessed them, and called their name Adam.

[5:3] Adam lived for a hundred and thirty years, and had a son in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth.[5:4] Adam lived for eight hundred years after he had Seth; and he had sons and daughters.[5:5] In total, Adam lived for nine hundred and thirty years; and then he died.

[5:6] Seth lived for a hundred and five years, and fathered Enosh.[5:7] Seth lived a further eight hundred and seven years after he had Enosh, and had sons and daughters.[5:8] In total, Seth lived for nine hundred and twelve years; and then he died.

[5:9] Enosh lived for ninety years, and fathered Kenan.[5:10] Enosh lived a further eight hundred and fifteen years after he had Kenan, and had sons and daughters.[5:11] In total, Enosh lived for nine hundred and five years; and then he died.

[5:12] Kenan lived for seventy years, and fathered Mahalalel.[5:13] Kenan lived for eight hundred and forty years after he had Mahalalel, and had sons and daughters.[5:14] In total, Kenan lived for nine hundred and ten years; and then he died.

[5:15] Mahalalel lived for sixty and five years, and fathered Jared.[5:16] Mahalalel lived for eight hundred and thirty years after he had Jared, and had sons and daughters.[5:17] In total, Mahalalel lived for eight hundred ninety and five years; and then he died.

[5:18] Jared lived for a hundred sixty and two years, and fathered Enoch.[5:19] Jared lived for eight hundred years after he had Enoch, and had sons and daughters.[5:20] In total, Jared lived for nine hundred sixty and two years; and then he died.

[5:21] Enoch lived for sixty and five years, and fathered Methuselah.[5:22] Enoch walked with God for three hundred years after he had Methuselah, and had sons and daughters.[5:23] In total, Enoch lived for three hundred sixty and five years.[5:24] Enoch walked with God, and then he was gone; because God took him.

[5:25] Methuselah lived for a hundred eighty and seven years, and fathered Lamech.[5:26] Methuselah lived for seven hundred eighty and two years after he had Lamech, and had sons and daughters.[5:27] In total, Methuselah lived for nine hundred sixty and nine years; and then he died.

[5:28] Lamech lived for a hundred eighty and two years, and had a son.[5:29] He named him Noah, saying: “He will bring us relief from our work and the toil of our hands which comes from the ground the LORD  cursed.”[5:30] Lamech lived for five hundred ninety and five years after he had Noah, and had sons and daughters.[5:31] In total, Lamech lived for seven hundred seventy and seven years; and then he died.

[5:32] When Noah was five hundred years old, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

 [Genesis 6] 

##### The divine beings and the beautiful daughters #####

[6:1] When people began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,[6:2] some of the heavenly beings saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful; and they took them as wives, whoever they chose.[6:3] But the LORD  said: “My spirit shall not abide in people forever, because they are flesh; therefore they will live for only a hundred and twenty years.”[6:4] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days (and later too) when the heavenly beings lay with the human daughters who had their children. These were the mighty heroes of old, men of renown.

##### The flood #####

[6:5] When the LORD  saw that people’s wickedness was increasing in the world, and that the trend of their thoughts was at all times toward evil,[6:6] he was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made people on the earth.[6:7] Therefore the LORD  said, “I will destroy all living beings from off the ground — people, animals, creeping things, and birds — because I regret that I have made them.”[6:8] But Noah had won the LORD ’s favor.

[6:9] This is the story of Noah. Among the people of his time, Noah was righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God.[6:10] Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.[6:11] God saw that the earth was corrupt and full of violence.[6:12] God looked at the earth and saw that it was corrupt; all living things on the earth had become corrupt in their ways.

[6:13] So God said to Noah, “I have determined to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with their acts of injustice; I am going to destroy them from the earth.[6:14] Make yourself an ark of cypress wood. Construct rooms in the ark, and coat it within and without with pitch.[6:15] This is how you shall build it: the length of the ark shall be five hundred feet, its breadth eighty feet, and its height fifty feet.[6:16] Make a roof for it and place the door on the side. Construct it with lower, second, and third storeys.[6:17] For I am about to bring floods of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven every living thing in which is the breath of life; every thing that is on the earth shall die.

[6:18] “But I will make a solemn agreement with you. Go into the ark with your sons, your wife and their wives,[6:19] and take with you into the ark two of every kind living thing, a male and a female,[6:20] birds, animals and creeping things, so that they might be kept alive.[6:21] Take and store food for them and you.”

[6:22] Noah did all this. He did everything that God told him to.

 [Genesis 7] 

[7:1] Then the LORD  said to Noah, “Enter with all your household into the ark; for I see that in this age you are living before me an upright life.[7:2] Take seven of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are not fit for food and sacrifice take only two, the male and the female;[7:3] and of the wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice take seven, to keep the species alive on the earth.[7:4] After seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made.”

[7:5] Then Noah did all that the LORD  commanded him.[7:6] He was six hundred years old, and when the waters of the flood came upon the earth[7:7] he, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood[7:8] together with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground.[7:9] Two by two, male and female, they entered the ark as God had commanded Noah.

[7:10] After seven days, the flood waters came.[7:11] In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day, all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened — and[7:12] it rained for forty days and forty nights.[7:13] That was the day that Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, and[7:14] every type of animal, and cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and bird[7:15] went with Noah into the ark, two by two of every kind of living thing.[7:16] They went in, male and female, as God had commanded Noah; and the LORD  shut Noah in the ark.

[7:17] The flood continued for forty days, and the waters increased and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth.[7:18] It floated on the surface as the waters rose higher over the land.[7:19] Higher the waters rose over the land — until the highest mountains were covered[7:20] by more than twenty feet.

[7:21] All creatures on the land, bird and cattle and animals, every creature that swarms on the ground, every person,[7:22] everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life, died.[7:23] The LORD  destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and creeping things, and the birds of the heavens, and Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark.

[7:24] The waters did not start to go down for a hundred and fifty days.

 [Genesis 8] 

[8:1] Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood subsided,[8:2] the fountains of the deed were stopped and the windows of heaven closed, and the rain from heaven ceased,[8:3] and the waters withdrew more and more from the land for a hundred and fifty days.[8:4] On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.[8:5] The waters continued to go down until, on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains could be seen.

[8:6] After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark,[8:7] and sent out a raven; and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.[8:8] He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the ground;[8:9] but the dove found no rest for her foot, and so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the surface of the whole earth. So he reached out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark.

[8:10] Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark.[8:11] The dove came in to him at dusk and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.[8:12] He waited seven days more and sent out the dove; but it did not return to him again.

[8:13] So it was that in the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the waters had dried up. Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.[8:14] It was the twenty-seventh day of the second month.

[8:15] God said to Noah,[8:16] “Leave the ark with your wife and sons and their wives.[8:17] Bring out every living creature, every bird, cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they can spread over the earth, and be fruitful and multiply.”[8:18] So Noah left the ark with his sons and his wife and his son’s wives,[8:19] and every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird came out one kind after another.[8:20] Noah built an altar to the LORD  and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.[8:21] When the LORD  smelled the pleasing odour, he said to himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of people because the inclination of their heart is evil from their youth, nor will I again destroy every living thing, as I have done.[8:22] While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.”

 [Genesis 9] 

[9:1] Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Bear children and multiply and repopulate the earth.[9:2] Every wild beast and bird and everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea shall fear and dread you; into your hand they are given.[9:3] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as I gave the green herbs, I give them all to you.[9:4] Only you shall not eat flesh while the life is in it, that is, the blood.

[9:5] “Moreover, your own life-blood will I require for a person’s life; from every beast will I require it, and from everyone who takes another’s life.[9:6] Whoever sheds a person’s blood, by people shall their blood be shed; for God made people in his own image.[9:7] But you are to bear children and repopulate the whole earth and subdue it.”

[9:8] God also said to Noah and to his sons with him,[9:9] “Now I make this solemn agreement with you and with your descendants[9:10] and with every living creature that is with you, with the birds, the cattle, and every wild animal that is with you of all that have gone out of the ark, even with every beast of the earth.[9:11] This is my solemn agreement: No living thing will ever again be cut off by the waters of the flood, and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”

[9:12] God said, “This is the symbol of the solemn agreement that I make for all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you:[9:13] I have placed my bow in the cloud and it shall be the symbol of the solemn agreement between me and the inhabitants of the earth.[9:14] Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud,[9:15] I will remember the agreement which is between me and you and every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all living things.[9:16] Whenever the bow is seen in the cloud, I will see it and remember the everlasting agreement between God and every living creature on earth,”[9:17] God said to Noah, “it is the sign of the solemn agreement which I have made with everything that lives on earth.”

##### Genealogy #####

[9:18] The sons of Noah, who left the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.[9:19] The descendants of these three sons of Noah spread over the whole earth.

##### Noah and the first vineyard #####

[9:20] Now Noah, the farmer, was the first to plant a vineyard.[9:21] When he drank the wine he became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent.[9:22] Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers about it.[9:23] But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward to cover the nakedness of their father, their faces being turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.[9:24] When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,[9:25] he said,

|  Cursed be Canaan;
|  may he be a slave of slaves to his brothers.

[9:26] Also he said:

|  Blessed of the LORD  be Shem;
|    and let Canaan be a slave to him.
|  [9:27] God enlarge Japheth
|    and let him live in the tents of Shem.
|  Let Canaan be a slave to him as well.

##### Genealogy #####

[9:28] Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.[9:29] All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.

 [Genesis 10] 

[10:1] Now these are the descendants of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and to them were sons born after the flood.[10:2] The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.[10:3] The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.[10:4] The sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.[10:5] From the descendants of these were the peoples of the coasts and islands divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.[10:6] The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.[10:7] The sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.[10:8] Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be known as a mighty one in the earth.[10:9] He was a mighty hunter before the LORD ; which is why people say: “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD .”[10:10] The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.[10:11] Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,[10:12] and Resen between Nineveh and Calah — which is the great city.[10:13] Mizraim fathered Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,[10:14] and Pathrusim, and Casluhim — from whom went forth the Philistines — and Caphtorim.[10:15] Canaan fathered Zidon his firstborn, and Heth;[10:16] and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite;[10:17] and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite;[10:18] and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.[10:19] The border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha.[10:20] These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.[10:21] To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.[10:22] The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.[10:23] The sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.[10:24] Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.[10:25] To Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.[10:26] Joktan fathered Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah;[10:27] and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah;[10:28] and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba;[10:29] and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.[10:30] Their settlements were from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, to the mountain of the east.[10:31] These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.[10:32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

 [Genesis 11] 

##### Babel #####

[11:1] All the inhabitants of the earth had one language and vocabulary;[11:2] and as they travelled westward, they found a broad valley in the land of Shinar, and made their home there.

[11:3] Then they said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them.” So they had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar.[11:4] They said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will touch the heavens. We will make a landmark, so that we are not scattered over all the earth.”

[11:5] But when the LORD  came down to see the city and tower that people had built,[11:6] he said, “See, they are one people and all have one language. This is only the beginning of their activity, and now nothing that they propose to do will seem too difficult for them.[11:7] Come, let us go down there and confuse their language, so that they do not understand each other’s speech.”

[11:8] So the LORD  scattered them from there over all the earth; and they ceased building the city.[11:9] That is why they named it Babel^[ Confusion], for there the LORD  confused the language of all the inhabitants of earth and scattered them over the whole world.

##### Genealogy #####

[11:10] These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.[11:11] Shem lived for five hundred years after he fathered Arpachshad, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:12] Arpachshad lived for five and thirty years, and fathered Shelah.[11:13] Arpachshad lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Shelah, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:14] Shelah lived for thirty years, and fathered Eber.[11:15] Shelah lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Eber, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:16] Eber lived for four and thirty years, and fathered Peleg.[11:17] Eber lived for four hundred and thirty years after he fathered Peleg, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:18] Peleg lived for thirty years, and fathered Reu.[11:19] Peleg lived for two hundred and nine years after he fathered Reu, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:20] Reu lived for two and thirty years, and fathered Serug.[11:21] Reu lived for two hundred and seven years after he fathered Serug, and fathered sons and daughters.[11:22] Serug lived for thirty years, and fathered Nahor.

[11:23] Serug lived for two hundred years after he fathered Nahor, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:24] Nahor lived for nine and twenty years, and fathered Terah.[11:25] Nahor lived for a hundred and nineteen years after he fathered Terah, and fathered sons and daughters.

[11:26] Terah lived for seventy years, and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

[11:27] Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.[11:28] Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.[11:29] Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.[11:30] Sarai was barren; she had no child.[11:31] Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they nt to Haran, and dwelt there.[11:32] In total, Terah lived for two hundred and five years; and died in Haran.

 [Genesis 12] 

##### Abram’s Journey #####

[12:1] The LORD  said to Abram, “Go from your country, your relatives and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.[12:2] I will make of you a great nation; and I will surely bless you and make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing.[12:3] I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you, and all the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like your own.”

[12:4] So Abram set out, as the LORD  had commanded him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.[12:5] He took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son and all the slaves that they had acquired in Haran, and started for the land of Canaan.

[12:6] Abram passed through the land to a place called Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites lived there.[12:7] The LORD  appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” There Abram built an altar to the LORD  who had appeared to him.[12:8] From there he moved on to the hill at the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east, and there too he built an altar to the LORD  and prayed to him.

[12:9] Abram moved on, going from place to place toward the Nagreb.[12:10] There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there; because the famine was severe in the land.[12:11] As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “You are a beautiful woman;[12:12] so that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘She is his wife’; and they will kill me, but let you live.[12:13] Say you are my sister, so that everything may go well for me because of you and my life will be spared.”[12:14] W hen Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Serai was very beautiful.[12:15] The officials of Pharaoh, when they saw her, praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh’s household.[12:16] He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, and oxen and donkeys, and male and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels.[12:17] But the LORD  sent great plagues to Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.[12:18] Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?[12:19] Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Here she is, take her and go.”[12:20] Pharaoh gave his men orders to send him on his way with his wife and all his possessions.

 [Genesis 13] 

[13:1] So Abram and his wife and all his possessions left Egypt and went to the Negreb and Lot went with him.[13:2] Abram was now very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.[13:3] He journeyed on from the Negreb in stages towards Bethel, to the place where he had earlier pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai[13:4] and had set up the alter to worship the LORD .

[13:5] Lot, who went with Abram, also had so many flocks and herds and tents[13:6] that the land was not fertile enough to support them both. They had too many animals to live in the same place.[13:7] At that time, the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land. So when there was a quarrel between Lot’s herdsmen and Abram’s herdsmen,[13:8] Abram said to Lot, “There should be no quarrels between me and you, or between my herdsmen and yours, because we are relatives.[13:9] Is not the whole land before you? Let’s separate. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.”

[13:10] Then Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of the LORD . (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)[13:11] So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan and went on to the east; and they separated from one another.[13:12] Abram lived in the land of Canaan and Lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.[13:13] (But the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinned against the LORD .)

[13:14] The LORD  said to Abram, after Lot had gone away from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward and westward,[13:15] for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever.[13:16] I will make your descendants as many as the dust of the earth, so that if someone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.[13:17] Rise, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”

[13:18] Then Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD .

 [Genesis 14] 

##### Victory over the Four Eastern Kings #####

[14:1] I n the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,[14:2] they went to war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).[14:3] All these joined forces together in the valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).

[14:4] For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaonier, but in the thirteenth year they had rebelled.[14:5] So in the fourteenth year Chedorlaonier, and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim,[14:6] and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, to El-Paran, which is on the edge of the wilderness.[14:7] Then they returned and came to En-Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and laid waste all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-Tamar.

[14:8] So the king of Sodom went out together with the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar); and they set themselves in battle array against them in the valley of Siddim;[14:9] against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.[14:10] Now the valley of Siddim is full of bitumen pits; so when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but those who remained fled to the mountain.[14:11] Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions and went their way.[14:12] They also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who was living in Sodom, and his goods and departed.

[14:13] But one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were supporters of Abram.[14:14] When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.[14:15] Then, dividing his band in order to attack the kings by night, he with his servants attacked them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus.[14:16] So he brought back all the goods, and also his kinsman Lot, with his goods, as well as the women and the people.

[14:17] Then the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Vale).[14:18] Melchizedek king of Salem also brought out bread and wine; and he was priest of God Most High.[14:19] He blessed him saying:

|  Blessed be Abram before God Most High,
|    possessor of heaven and earth.
|  [14:20] Blessed be God Most High,
|    who has delivered your foes into your power.

Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

[14:21] The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me my people, and take the goods for yourself.”[14:22] But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,[14:23] that I would not take a thread nor a sandal-thong nor anything that is yours, so that you could not say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’[14:24] By no means! Only that which the servants have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre — let them take their portion.”

 [Genesis 15] 

##### Abram’s vision #####

[15:1] After these things God spoke to Abram in a vision saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield. Your reward will be exceedingly great.”[15:2] But Abram said, “Lord GOD , what can you give me? I am childless, and the person who will be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus,[15:3] to me you have given no offspring, and, so a slave born in my house is my heir.”[15:4] The word of the LORD  came to him, “This man will not be your heir, but a child of your own will be your heir.”

[15:5] Then God brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them! So will your descendants be.”[15:6] Abram believed in the LORD ; and the LORD  reckoned it to him as righteousness,[15:7] and said to him, “I am the LORD  who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give to you this land to inherit it.”

[15:8] Abram said, “Lord GOD , how will I know that I will inherit it?”

[15:9] The LORD  said to him, “Bring me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.”[15:10] Abram brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds he did not divide.[15:11] The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

[15:12] When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a horror of great darkness fell on him.[15:13] The LORD  said to Abram, “Know certainly that your descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there; and they will be held there for four hundred years.[15:14] But I will judge that nation, whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many goods.[15:15] But you will go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried in a good old age.[15:16] In the fourth generation they return here again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”

[15:17] When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between the pieces of the animals.

[15:18] At that time the LORD  made a solemn agreement with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.”[15:19] (This includes the lands of the Kenite, the Kenizzite, the Kadmonite,[15:20] the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Rephaim,[15:21] the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Girgashite, and Jebusite).

 [Genesis 16] 

##### Hagar and Ishmael #####

[16:1] Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar.[16:2] Sarai said to Abram, “the LORD  has denied me children; Take my slave-girl; maybe I will obtain children by her.” Then Abram listened to her[16:3] so she took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, after Abram had lived for ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife[16:4] and Abram lay with Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.

[16:5] Sarai complained to Abram, “May the wrong I suffer be on you! I myself gave my slave-girl to you; and now that she sees that she has conceived, I am despised by her; may the LORD  judge between me and you.”[16:6] But Abram said to Sarai, “Your maid-servant is in your power, do to her whatever seems right to you.” Then Sarai ill-treated her so that she fled from her presence.

[16:7] The messenger of the LORD  found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring in the way to Shur.[16:8] He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave-girl, where have you come from? And where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of mistress Sarai.”[16:9] Then the messenger of the LORD  said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit yourself to her authority.”[16:10] Moreover the messenger of the LORD  said to her, “I will make your descendants so many that they can not be numbered because they are so numerous.”[16:11] The messenger of the LORD  also said to her, “You are pregnant, and will have a son; you must call him Ishmael God hears, because the LORD  has heard of your ill-treatment.”

|  [16:12] He shall be like a wild donkey,
|    his hand against every man,
|    and every man’s hand against him;
|  and he will live at odds with all his relatives.

[16:13] Then she called the name of the LORD, who had spoken to her, El-roi (You are a God who sees me); for she said, “Have I seen God and am I still alive after I have looked upon him?”[16:14] Therefore the well is called Beer-lahai-roi^[ Well of the living One who sees me], ( it is between Kadesh and Bered)[16:15] Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.[16:16] Abram was eighty-six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael.

 [Genesis 17] 

##### Abram becomes Abraham #####

[17:1] When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD  revealed himself to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty, walk before me and be blameless[17:2] and I will make my solemn agreement between me and you and will make your descendants exceedingly numerous.”[17:3] Then Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying[17:4] “I make this solemn promise to you: you will be the father of a multitude of nations.[17:5] Neither will your name any longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I will make you the father of a multitude of nations.[17:6] I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and will make nations of you, and kings shall spring from you.[17:7] I will establish my solemn agreement between me and you and your descendants after your throughout their generations, an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your descendants after you.[17:8] I will give to you, and to your descendants after your, the land where you are now foreigners, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.”

##### Circumcision #####

[17:9] God also said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep the requirements of my solemn agreement, you, and your descendants after you throughout their generations.[17:10] This is my solemn agreement, which you must keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you must be circumcised.[17:11] Whenever you are circumcised, the flesh of your foreskin shall be a sign of a solemn agreement between me and you.[17:12] Every male when he is eight days old, must be circumcised throughout your generations, whether he is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.[17:13] The slave who is born in your house and the one who is bought with your money must be circumcised. The sign of my solemn agreement will be in your flesh — an everlasting agreement.[17:14] As for the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that one will be cut off from his people; he has broken my solemn agreement.”

##### Sarai becomes Sarah #####

[17:15] Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her name Sarai, but Sarah.[17:16] I will bless her, and will give you a son from her: I will bless her, and she will become the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.”

[17:17] Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself. “Will a child be born to one who is an hundred years old? Will Sarah who is ninety years old bear children?”[17:18] Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live with your blessing!”

[17:19] But God said, “No. But Sarah your wife is about to bear your a son; call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.[17:20] However I have heard you regarding Ishmael: I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and his descendants exceedingly many. Twelve princes he will father, and I will make him a great nation.[17:21] But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time next year.”[17:22] When he had finished talking with him, God left Abraham.

##### Abraham and Isaac’s circumcision #####

[17:23] Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very same day, as God had said to him.[17:24] Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.[17:25] Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.[17:26] On this very same day was Abraham circumcised, with Ishmael his son.[17:27] All the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from foreigners, were circumcised with him.

 [Genesis 18] 

##### The guests at the oaks of Mamre #####

[18:1] The LORD  also appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day;[18:2] and, as he looked up, three men stood there before him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed to the ground[18:3] and said, “Sirs, if you are willing to do me a favor, do not, I beg of you, pass by your servant.[18:4] Since you have come to your servant, let a little water be brought, so that you may wash your feet, and lie down under the tree.[18:5] And let me bring some food, so that you may refresh yourselves; afterward you may go on your way.” They replied, “Do as you have said.”

[18:6] So Abraham hastened to Sarah’s tent and said, “Make ready quickly four measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”[18:7] Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a calf that was tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he prepared it quickly.[18:8] Then Abraham took curd and milk, with the calf that he had prepared, and served them; and he waited on them under the tree, while they ate.

[18:9] Then they said to him, “Where is your wife?” He said, “There, within the tent.”[18:10] One of them said, “I will surely return to you about nine months from now, and then, Sarah your wife shall have a son.”But Sarah was listening behind the door of the tent.[18:11] Now Sarah and Abraham were advanced in years;[18:12] so she laughed to herself, saying, “After I and my husband are so old will I have pleasure?”[18:13] But the LORD  said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I, indeed, even when I am old give birth to a child?’[18:14] Is anything too wonderful for the LORD ? At the appointed time about nine months from now, I will return to you and Sarah shall have a son.”[18:15] Sarah was frightened and denied that she had laughed, but he said “Yes, you laughed.”

[18:16] Then the men started from there and looked off in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went along with them to start them on their way.[18:17] the LORD  said, “Should I conceal from Abraham that which I am about to do,[18:18] since Abraham will become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will want a blessing like his for themselves?[18:19] For I have chosen him in order that he may teach his sons and his household after him, and that they may keep the way of the LORD, by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD  may bring on Abraham that which he has promised concerning him.”

##### Sodom and Gomorrah #####

[18:20] The LORD  said, “The complaint has come that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have committed great and terrible sins.[18:21] I will go down and see whether they have done exactly as the complaint comes to me; and if they have not, I will know.”

[18:22] As the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, Abraham remained standing before the LORD .[18:23] Abraham drew near to the LORD  and said, “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?[18:24] Suppose there are within the city fifty people who are righteous. Will you sweep it away and not forgive the place for sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?[18:25] Far be it from you to do this: to slay the righteous with the wicked! And that the righteous should be treated as the wicked, far be it from you! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”[18:26] The LORD  said, “If I find in the city of Sodom fifty who are righteous, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”[18:27] Abraham answered, “I have dared to speak to the LORD, even though I am but dust and ashes.[18:28] Suppose there be five lacking of the fifty righteous. Will you sweep away all the city for lack of five?” The LORD  said, “I will not sweep it away, if I find forty-five there.”

[18:29] Then Abraham spoke to him again, and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” He replied, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.”[18:30] Then Abraham said, “Oh, let not the LORD  be angry, but let me speak. Suppose thirty are found there?” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”[18:31] Then Abraham said, “You see that I have dared to speak to the LORD . Suppose twenty are found there?” He replied, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.”[18:32] Then Abraham said, “Oh, let not the LORD  be angry, but let me speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there?” And he said, “For the sake of the ten I will not destroy it.”[18:33] Then the LORD  went his way, and Abraham returned home.

 [Genesis 19] 

[19:1] Two messengers came to Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed with his face to the earth[19:2] and said, “Sirs, turn aside, I beg of you, into your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No, we will spend the night in the street.”[19:3] But he urged them so strongly that they went with him and entered his house. He made a feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate.

[19:4] But before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.[19:5] They called out to Lot, “Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can rape them.”

[19:6] Then Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the door after him.[19:7] He said, “I beg of you, my friends, do not do what is wrong.[19:8] See, I have two unmarried daughters; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you desire; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.”[19:9] But they replied, “Stand back!” And they added, “This one came in as a foreigner to live here, but now he would set himself up as a judge! We will treat you worse than them.” They pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the door.[19:10] But the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and shut the door.[19:11] Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of searching for the door.

[19:12] Then the men said to Lot, “Have you any one else here? Bring your sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city out of this place,[19:13] for we are about to destroy it, because great complaint concerning the people has come to the LORD  and he has sent us to destroy it.”[19:14] So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, “Up, go out of this place, for the LORD  will destroy the city.” But his sons-in-law thought he was only jesting.

[19:15] When the dawn appeared, the messengers urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters so that you may not be swept away in the punishment of the city.”[19:16] When he hesitated, the men grabbed him by the hand and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for the LORD  was merciful to him.

[19:17] When they had brought them outside, they said, “Run for your life; do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the heights, that you may not be swept away!”[19:18] But Lot said to them, “Oh, sirs, not so![19:19] See, your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die.[19:20] See now, this village is near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my life will be saved.”[19:21] He answered, “I have also granted you this favor, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken.[19:22] Make haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.” Therefore the village was called Zoar^[ Little].

[19:23] The sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar.[19:24] Then the LORD  caused brimstone and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah,[19:25] and he destroyed those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and all that grew on the ground.[19:26] But Lot’s wife, who was following him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

[19:27] Early in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD ;[19:28] and as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a smelting-furnace.[19:29] God had remembered Abraham when he destroyed the cities of the plain and rescued Lot from the destruction.

##### Lot and his daughters #####

[19:30] Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar.[19:31] The older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world.[19:32] Come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.”[19:33] So they made their father drink wine that night; and the older daughter went in and lay with her father. He, however, did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.[19:34] Then in the morning the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I lay with my father. Let us make him drink wine again tonight; and you go in and lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.”[19:35] So they made their father drink wine that night as well. The younger arose and lay with him. He, however, did not know when she lay down nor when she arose.[19:36] In this way both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.[19:37] Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. His oldest daughter bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the present Moabites.[19:38] The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi. That one is the father of the present Ammonites.

 [Genesis 20] 

##### Abraham in Gerar #####

[20:1] Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negreb, settling between Kadesh and Shur, and staying for a while in Gerar,[20:2] where he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.[20:3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him, “You will die, because of the woman you have taken, for she is married.[20:4] But Abimelech had not come near her; so he said, Lord, will you slay an innocent people?[20:5] Did Abraham not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister?’ And even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I acted innocently and in good faith.”[20:6] Then God said to him in the dream, “I know that you acted innocently and in good faith, and I also prevented you from sinning against me, since I did not allow you to touch her.[20:7] Now you must restore the man’s wife — for he is a prophet and he can intercede for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her at once, you will die, together with all your people.”[20:8] Abimelech rose early in the morning, and summoned all his court, and when he had told all these things in their hearing, they were greatly afraid.

[20:9] Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked him, “What have you done to us? What harm have I done to you to make you bring this great sin on me and my kingdom? You have done to me something that ought not to be done.”[20:10] Abimelech said to Abraham, “What was your purpose in doing this thing?”[20:11] Abraham answered, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.’[20:12] Moreover, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.[20:13] So when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: at every place to which we come, say that you are my brother.’”

[20:14] Abimelech then took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.[20:15] Also Abimelech said, “My land lies before you; live wherever you please.”[20:16] To Sarah he said, “I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silveras compensation for all that has befallen you; and in every respect you are vindicated.”[20:17] Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his slave-girls, so that they could have children ([20:18] for the LORD  had made every woman in Abimelech’s household barren, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife).

 [Genesis 21] 

##### Isaac #####

[21:1] The LORD  remembered what he had told Sarah, and he did as he had promised.[21:2] So Sarah had Abraham’s son in his old age at the fixed time of which God had told him.[21:3] Abraham named him Isaac^[ Laughter][21:4] and when he was eight days old he circumcised him as God had told him to.[21:5] Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.[21:6] Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”[21:7] She added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have born him a son in his old age.”

[21:8] When the child grew up, Abraham made a great feast on the day that he was weaned.[21:9] But Sarah saw the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.[21:10] S he said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave-girl and her son, for the son of this slave-girl shall not be heir with my son Isaac”[21:11] This request was very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son.[21:12] But the LORD  said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased because of the boy and because of your slave-girl. Listen to all that Sarah says to you, for only through the line of Isaac will your name be perpetuated.[21:13] But I will also make of the son of the slave-girl a great nation, because he is your son.”

[21:14] Then Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, and he put the boy upon her shoulder and sent her away. So she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.[21:15] When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under one of the desert shrubs[21:16] and went a short distance away and sat down and said, “Let me not see the death of the child.” So she sat there and wept.

[21:17] Then the LORD  heard the cry of the boy, and the messenger of the LORD  called to Hagar from heaven and said, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for the LORD  has heard the boy’s cry.[21:18] Rise, lift him up, and hold him fast by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.”[21:19] The LORD  opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. Then she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.

[21:20] The LORD  was with the boy, and he grew up,[21:21] and lived in the wilderness of Paran, and became a bowman. His mother secured a wife for him from Egypt.

##### The pact with Abimelech #####

[21:22] It happened at that time that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all you do.[21:23] Now therefore take an oath to me here by God that you will not be false to me, nor to my son nor to my descendants; but that you will treat me and the land you have stayed in according to the kindness which I have shown you.”[21:24] Abraham said, “I swear it.”

[21:25] Now as often as Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized,[21:26] Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing, neither have you told me nor have I heard of it until today.”[21:27] So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and made an agreement with each other.[21:28] But when Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves,[21:29] Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?”[21:30] Abraham answered, “Accept these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that you may be my witness that I dug this well.”[21:31] The place was called Beer-sheba, because it was there they swore their oath.[21:32] So they made a solemn agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech arose with Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.[21:33] Abraham, however, planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.[21:34] Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.

 [Genesis 22] 

##### The test of Abraham #####

[22:1] Later the LORD  tested Abraham, saying to him, “Abraham”; and he answered, “Here I am.”[22:2] The LORD  said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will show you.”

[22:3] So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. When he had split the wood for the burnt-offering, he set out for the place of which God had told him.[22:4] On the third day, when Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance,[22:5] he said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while I and the boy go over there. When we have worshipped, we will come back to you.”

[22:6] Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac, his son. He took the fire and the knife, and they both went on together.[22:7] Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” and Abraham answered, “Yes, my son.” Isaac said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?”[22:8] Abraham answered, “My son, God will himself provide a lamb for a burnt-offering.” So the two went on together.

[22:9] When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood on it and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.[22:10] Then Abraham reached out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.[22:11] But the messenger of the LORD  called to him from heaven, saying, “Abraham, Abraham!” and he answered, “Here am I.”[22:12] He said, “Do not put your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him, for now I know that you love God, for you have not refused to give your son, your only son, to me.”

[22:13] Then Abraham looked up, and he saw a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.[22:14] So Abraham took the ram and offered him up as a burnt-offering instead of his son.[22:15] He named the place “The LORD  will provide” — and even today people say, “The LORD  will provide on his mountain.”

[22:16] The messenger of the LORD  again called to Abraham and said, “The LORD  declares, ‘Because you have done this thing and have not kept back your son, your only son,[22:17] I will surely bless you. I will make your children as many as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore, so that they will conquer their enemies.[22:18] All the nations of the earth will ask for themselves a blessing like theirs, because you have obeyed my command.’”

[22:19] So Abraham returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba.

##### Genealogy #####

Abraham was living in Beer-sheba.[22:20] After these things, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor,[22:21] Uz his first born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,[22:22] Chesed, Hazo and Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”[22:23] (And Bethuel fathered Rebekah). These eight Mileah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.[22:24] And his concubine whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maaeah.

 [Genesis 23] 

##### Sarah’s death and the cave of Machpelah #####

[23:1] Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.[23:2] When she died in Kiriath-arba (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan, Abraham went to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

[23:3] When Abraham rose up from the presence of his dead, he said to the Hittites,[23:4] “I am a stranger and a foreigner living among you; give me possession of a burying-place with you, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”[23:5] The Hittites answered Abraham,[23:6] “Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the best of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, so that you may bury your dead.”

[23:7] Abraham rose up and bowed before the people of the land, the Hittites,[23:8] and said to them, “If it is your intention that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and speak for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,[23:9] to give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give to me for the full price in your presence, so that I can own it as a burying-place.”[23:10] Now Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites, and, in the presence of all the Hittites, all who went in and out at the gate of his city he answered Abraham,[23:11] “No, my lord, hear me. I give the field to you and the cave that is in it I give to you; in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.”

[23:12] Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,[23:13] and spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “Please, hear me — I will give the price of the field; accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there.”

[23:14] Ephron answered Abraham by saying to him,[23:15] “My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.”[23:16] Then Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, on the standard weights used by merchants.

[23:17] So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah which was to the east of Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, with all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about,[23:18] were transferred to Abraham’s possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

[23:19] After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.[23:20] In this way the field and the cave that is in it were transferred by the Hittites to Abraham that he might possess a burying-place.

 [Genesis 24] 

##### Rebekah #####

[24:1] When Abraham was very old and the LORD  had blessed him in every way,[24:2] Abraham said to the eldest of his household servants, who had charge of all his affairs, “Put your hand under my thigh,[24:3] while I make you promise by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,[24:4] but that you will go to my own country and to my relatives and there get a wife for my son Isaac.”[24:5] The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”[24:6] Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there.[24:7] The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land and who solemnly promised me, ‘To your children I will give this land,’ will send his messenger before you and there you will get a wife for my son.[24:8] But if the woman is not willing to come with you, then you will be free from this promise to me; only never take my son back there.”[24:9] So the servant put his hand under Abraham’s thigh and made the promise.

[24:10] Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and set out with precious gifts from his master. So he went to the town of Aram-naharaim, where Nahor lived.[24:11] He made the camels kneel down outside the town by the well in the evening, at the time when women go out to draw water.[24:12] Then he said, “LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me, I pray, success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.[24:13] Here I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw water.[24:14] May that young woman to whom I shall say, ‘Please let down your water-jar that I may drink’; and who answers, ‘Drink and I will also water your camels,’ may she be the one you have chosen for thy servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown kindness to my master.”

[24:15] Then even before he was through speaking, Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water-jar upon her shoulder.[24:16] She was very beautiful and unmarried, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.[24:17] Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”[24:18] She answered, “Drink, sir,” and quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder upon her hand and gave him a drink.

[24:19] When she had finished giving him a drink she said, “I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”[24:20] So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.[24:21] Meanwhile the man was silently gazing at her in order to find out whether the LORD  had made his journey successful or not.

[24:22] As soon as the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring, half a shekel in weight, and put it in her nose, and put on her arms two golden bracelets weighing ten shekels,[24:23] and said, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I beg of you. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”[24:24] She answered, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of of Milcah and Nahor.[24:25] We have plenty of straw and feed, and there is a place for you to spend the night.”

[24:26] Then the man bowed his head and worshipped the LORD,[24:27] saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has continued to show his mercy and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD  has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”

[24:28] Then the young woman ran and told these things to her mother’s family.[24:29] Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.[24:30] When he saw the bracelets on his sister’s hands and the ring, and when he heard Rebekah say, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man, who was still standing by the camels at the spring,[24:31] and said, “Come in, you who are blessed by the LORD ! Why do you stand outside? For I have cleared the house and have room for the camels.”[24:32] So he brought the man into the house and took the packs off the camels and furnished straw and feed for them, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

[24:33] But when food was set before him to eat, he said, “I will not eat until I have made known my errand.” They answered, “Speak.”[24:34] He said, “I am Abraham’s servant;[24:35] and the LORD  has blessed my master greatly, so that he has become very rich. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants, and camels and donkeys.[24:36] Now Sarah, my master’s wife, had a son when she was old, and my master has given him all that he has.[24:37] My master also made me promise, saying, ‘Do not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,[24:38] but go to my father’s home and to my relatives and there find a wife for my son.’

[24:39] “When I said to my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’[24:40] he said to me, ‘The LORD, whom I love and serve, will send his messenger with you and make you successful, and you will find for my son a wife from among my relatives and my father’s family.[24:41] Then you will be free from your promise to me. But if you go to my family and they do not give her to you, you shall also be free from your promise to me.’[24:42-43] So I came today to the spring and said, ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, see, I am standing by the spring of water. If you will make the errand on which I am going successful, then let the young woman who comes to draw, to whom I say, ‘Please give me a little water from your jar to drink’,[24:44] and who shall say to me, ‘Drink, and I will also draw for your camels’, let that one be the woman whom the LORD  has chosen for my master’s son.’

[24:45] “Even before I was through speaking, Rebekah came out with her water-jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. When I said to her, ‘Please let me drink,’[24:46] she quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder and answered, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.[24:47] Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.[24:48] I bowed my head and worshipped and blessed the LORD  God of my master Abraham who had led me on the right way to find the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.[24:49] Tell me whether or not you will deal kindly and truly with my master, so that I shall know what to do!”

[24:50] Then Laban and his family answered, “The matter is in the hands of the LORD . We cannot say either ‘yes’ or ‘no.’[24:51] See, Rebekah is before you; take her and go and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD  has said.”

[24:52] When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the LORD .[24:53] Then he brought out gold and silver ornaments and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.[24:54] He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.

When they rose in the morning, the servant said, “Send me away to my master.”[24:55] But Rebekah’s brother and mother answered, “Let the young woman stay with us a month or at least ten days; after that she may go.”[24:56] But he said to them, “Do not delay me, for the LORD  has given me success. Send me away that I may go to my master.”

[24:57] Then they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her.”[24:58] So they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She answered, “I will go.”[24:59] So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men.

[24:60] They also blessed Rebekah, saying to her, “Our sister! May your children and their children become thousands and thousands, may your sons conquer the cities of their enemies!”[24:61] Then Rebekah set out with her maids and, riding upon the camels, they followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went away.

[24:62] Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.[24:63] In the evening, when Isaac had gone out for a walk in the field, he looked up and saw camels coming.[24:64] Rebekah too looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she quickly alighted from the camel[24:65] and said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?” When the servant said, “It is my master,” she took her veil and covered her face.[24:66] Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done.[24:67] Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of Sarah his mother, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.

 [Genesis 25] 

##### Geneaology, Abraham’s death #####

[25:1] Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.[25:2] She gave him sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.[25:3] Jokshan fathered Sheba, and Dedan. T he sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim;[25:4] and the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.

[25:5] Abraham had left all that he had to Isaac.[25:6] But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham had given gifts while he was still alive, and had sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.

[25:7] Abraham had lived for one hundred and seventy-five years,[25:8] when he breathed his last, dying in a good old age, old and satisfied with living, and was gathered to his forefathers.

[25:9] Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre,[25:10] the field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.

[25:11] After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, who settled at Beer-lahai-roi.

[25:12] This is a list of descedents of Ishmael, Abraham’s son whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid-servant gave to Abraham.[25:13] These then are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named according to their order of birth: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,[25:14] Mishma, Dumah, Massa,[25:15] Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.[25:16] These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their peoples.

[25:17] Ishmael lived for one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.[25:18] They settled from Havilah to Shur that iseast of Egypt, as far as Assyria; he settled down alongside all his people.

[25:19] These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham fathered Isaac.[25:20] Isaac was forty years old, when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.

##### Esau and Jacob #####

[25:21] Isaac prayed to the LORD  for his wife, because she had no children; and the LORD  heard his prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant with twins.[25:22] The children struggled against each other in her womb, and she said, “Why is this happening to me? What does it mean?” She went to ask the LORD,[25:23] who said to her,

|  “Two nations are in your womb,
|    two peoples divided from birth,
|  One will be stronger than the other,
|    the elder will serve the younger.”

[25:24] When the time came for her to give birth, she became the mother of twin boys.[25:25] The first was from birth red, all over like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau^[ Hairy].[25:26] Afterwards his brother came holding Esau’s heel with his hand; so he was named Jacob^[ Supplanter]. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.

[25:27] As they grew up, Esau became a skilful hunter, a man who lived out in the fields; but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed about the tents.[25:28] Isaac loved Esau, for he had a taste for venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.

[25:29] Once when Jacob was preparing a stew, Esau came in from the fields, and he was very hungry;[25:30] so he said to Jacob, “Let me swallow some of that red stew, for I am very hungry.” (This is why he was called Edom.)[25:31] But Jacob said, “Sell me first of all your right as the eldest.”[25:32] Esau replied, “See, I am nearly dead now! So of what use is this birthright to me?”[25:33] Jacob said, “First solemnly promise to give it to me.” So Esau solemnly promised and sold his birthright to Jacob.[25:34] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils, and when he had finished eating and drinking, he got up and went away. In this way Esau gave away his birthright.

 [Genesis 26] 

##### Famine again #####

[26:1] Now when a famine came in the land, (not the first famine that was in the days of Abraham), Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.

[26:2] The LORD  appeared to him and said, “Go not down into Egypt; settle in the land of which I will tell you,[26:3] stay in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you, and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, and will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father:[26:4] I will make your descendants as many as the stars of heaven, and give to your descendants all these lands; and all the nations of the earth will invoke for themselves a blessing like that of your descendants,[26:5] because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”[26:6] So Isaac settled in Gerar.

[26:7] The men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, “She is my sister”; for he was afraid to say “my wife”; lest the men of the place kill him for Rebekah; because she was beautiful to look at.[26:8] But after he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of the window, and saw Isaac just as he was caressing Rebekah his wife.

[26:9] Then Abimelech called to Isaac, and said, “Surely she is your wife; why did you say ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac answered him, “I said it, so that I might not die because of her.”[26:10] Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife and so you would have brought guilt upon us.”[26:11] Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “The person who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.”

[26:12] Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year an increase of a hundredfold, for the LORD  blessed him.[26:13] The man became rich, and grew richer and richer until he became very wealthy; for he had many flocks, and many herds, and a great household; so that the Philistines envied him.

[26:14] Now all the wells which Isaac’s father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.[26:15] But Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father — for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he gave them the same names as his father had given them.

[26:16] Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go from us; for you are much mightier than we are.”[26:17] So Isaac departed, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.[26:18] Isaac reopened the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and stopped by the Philistines after his death. He called them by the names his father had given them.[26:19] When Isaac’s slaves dug in the valley, they found there a well of spring water.[26:20] The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek^[ Contention], because they contended with him.[26:21] And when they dug another well, they quarreled over that also. So he called the name of it Sitnah^[ Enmity].[26:22] He moved on from these and dug another well; and over that one there was no dispute. So he called it Rehoboth^[ Room], and said, “For now the LORD  has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land.”

[26:23] Isaac went up from there to Beer-sheba.[26:24] The LORD  appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father, do not be afraid, because I am with you, and will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham.”[26:25] Isaac built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. There also Isaac’s slaves dug a well.

[26:26] Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.[26:27] Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hated me and have driven me away from you?”[26:28] They said, “We saw plainly that the LORD  was with you, so we said, ‘Let there now be a sworn treaty between us — let us make a solemn agreement with you —[26:29] so that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now blessed of the LORD .”[26:30] And he made them a feast and they ate and drank.[26:31] Then in the morning they arose early and took oaths with each other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.[26:32] That same day, Isaac’s slaves came and told him about a well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”[26:33] He called it Shebna^[ Oath], therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.

##### Esau and Jacob #####

[26:34] When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,[26:35] and they were a source of grief to Isaac and to Rebekah.

 [Genesis 27] 

[27:1] When Isaac was so old and so nearly blind that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son and said to him, “My son.” Esau answered, “Here I am.”[27:2] Isaac said, “See, I am old and do not know how soon I may die.[27:3] T ake your quiver and your bow and go out into the fields and hunt venison for me[27:4] and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat and that I may bless you before I die.”

[27:5] Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went into the fields to hunt venison,[27:6] Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I just now heard your father say to your brother Esau,[27:7] ‘Bring me venison and prepare for me savory food that I may eat it and bless you before I die.’[27:8] Now, my son, do as I tell you:[27:9] Go to the flock and bring me from there two good young goats, and I will make of them savory food for your father, such as he loves.[27:10] Then take it to him, so that he may eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”[27:11] But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am smooth.[27:12] Perhaps my father will touch me; then I will appear to him to be a deceiver, and I will bring blame upon me and not a blessing.”[27:13] But his mother said to him, “Let the curse be on me, my son; only obey me and go, bring the goats to me.”[27:14] So he went and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food such as his father loved.

[27:15] Rebekah also took the fine clothes of her older son Esau, which she had with her in the tent, and put them on her younger son Jacob.[27:16] Then she put the skins of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck,[27:17] and she placed the savory food and the bread which she had prepared in his hand,[27:18] and he went to his father and said, “My father.” Isaac answered, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”[27:19] Jacob said, “I am Esau your oldest son. I have done as you commanded me. Sit up and eat some of my venison, so that you may bless me.”[27:20] Isaac said to his son, “How very quickly you have found it, my son.” He answered, “Yes, because the LORD  your God gave me success.”

[27:21] Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come here, my son, that I may touch you to find out whether you are really my son Esau or not.”[27:22] So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.[27:23-24] Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob answered, “I am.” Isaac did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s. So he blessed him.[27:25] Then Isaac said, “Bring the food to me, that I may eat some of my son’s venison and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate. Jacob also brought him wine, and he drank.

[27:26] Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.”[27:27] As he came near and kissed him, he smelled the smell of his garment, and blessed him:

|  See, the smell of my son
|    is as that of fields blessed by the LORD .
|  [27:28] May God give you dew from heaven,
|    a share in the earth’s fertile places,
|    and plenty of corn and wine.
|  [27:29] May peoples be subject to you,
|    and nations bow down to you.
|  Be master over your brothers.
|    Let your mother’s sons bow down before you,
|  Cursed be all who curse you.
|    and blessed be all who bless you.

[27:30] As soon as Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and Jacob was about to leave his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.[27:31] He also had made savory food and was bringing it to his father. So he said to him, “Father, rise and eat of your son’s venison, that you may bless me.”[27:32] But Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your oldest, Esau.”[27:33] Then Isaac trembled and said, “Who then is he that has hunted venison and brought it to me, so that I ate plentifully before you came, and blessed him? His blessing cannot be undone!”

[27:34] When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Father, bless me also!”

[27:35] But Isaac said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”[27:36] Esau said, “He was correctly named Jacob^[ means Supplanter]. He has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Have you kept a blessing for me?”[27:37] Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him your master and I have given to him all his relatives as slaves and grain and wine as his food. What then can I do for you, my son?”[27:38] Esau said to his father, “Is that the only blessing you have, my father? Father, bless me too!” and Esau began to weep aloud.[27:39] Then Isaac his father answered him:

|  “You shall live far from earth’s fertile places,
|    and away from the dew of heaven.
|  [27:40] By your sword you will live,
|    and your brother you will serve.
|  But whenever you will break loose,
|    you will break off his yoke from your neck.”

[27:41] Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him. Esau said to himself, “My father will soon die; then I will kill Jacob, my brother.”

[27:42] When the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother, Esau, is going to kill you.[27:43] Now, my son, listen to me: run away to my brother Laban at Haran[27:44] and stay with him for a time until your brother is no longer angry[27:45] — until he is no longer angry and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”

##### Wives for Jacob and Esau #####

[27:46] Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with life because of the Hittite women; if Jacob marries a Hittite woman, such as these, the women of the land, I might as well die.”

 [Genesis 28] 

[28:1] Then Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and instructed him, “You must not marry any of the daughters of Canaan.[28:2] Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.[28:3] May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful and numerous, so that you may become a great people,[28:4] and may he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you so that you may inherit the land you have settled in, which God gave to Abraham.”

[28:5] So Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau’s mother.[28:6] Now when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and send him away to Paddan-aram, to find a wife there, and that, as he blessed him, he instructed him: “You must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan”,[28:7] and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-aram,[28:8] and when Esau also saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father,[28:9] then Esau went to Ishmael, and in addition to the wives that he had, married Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth.

##### Jacob and the ladder #####

[28:10] Then Jacob set out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.[28:11] When he arrived at a certain holy place, he passed the night there, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from its place and put it under his head and lay down to sleep.[28:12] Then he dreamed and saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and the messengers of God were going up and down on it.

[28:13] The LORD  also stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, God of Abraham and God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your children.[28:14] Your descendants will be as countless as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and all the families of the earth will wish for a blessing like yours and that of your descendants.[28:15] See, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”

[28:16] When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, “Surely the LORD  is in this place, and I did not know it.”[28:17] And he was filled with awe and said, “This place is the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”

[28:18] So Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it.[28:19] He named that place Bethel^[ which means House of God]. (The earlier name of the town was Luz.)[28:20] Jacob also made this promise, “If God will be with me and protect me on this journey which I am making and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,[28:21] and if I return safe and sound to my father’s house, then the LORD  shall be my God,[28:22] and this stone which I have set up as a pillar will be a house of God. And of all that you give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”

 [Genesis 29] 

##### Leah and Rachel #####

[29:1] Jacob continued on his journey and arrived at the land of the people of the East.[29:2] He looked and saw a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep lying down by it; for from that well they watered the flocks; but there was a large stone over the well.[29:3] When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds used to roll away the stone and water the sheep and then put the stone back in its place over the well.

[29:4] Jacob said to the men, “My friends, from where do you come?” They said, “We are from Haran.”[29:5] Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”[29:6] He said to them, “Is all well with him?” They said, “All is well; indeed, this is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.”[29:7] H e said, “See, the sun is still high! It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep and feed them.”[29:8] But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll away the stone from the well; then we will water the sheep.”

[29:9] While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she was a shepherdess.[29:10] When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.[29:11] Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.[29:12] When Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, she ran and told her father.

[29:13] As soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, put his arms around him, kissed him many times, and brought him to his home. When Jacob told Laban all that had happened,[29:14] Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” So he remained with him a whole month.

[29:15] Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you serve me for nothing simply because you are related to me? Tell me what shall be your wages?”[29:16] Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.[29:17] Leah’s eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful.[29:18] Jacob loved Rachel, and so he said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”[29:19] Laban said, “It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to any other man. Stay with me.”[29:20] So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days, because he loved her so.

[29:21] Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is up, and let me marry her.”[29:22] So Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.[29:23] In the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob received her as his wife.[29:24] At the same time Laban gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah.

[29:25] When in the morning Jacob found it was Leah, he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”[29:26] Laban said, “It is not the custom among us to give the younger in marriage before the older.[29:27] Remain with this one during the marriage week, then we will give you the other also for the service which you will give me during seven more years.”[29:28] Jacob did so: he remained with Leah during the marriage week. Then Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife,[29:29] and his slave-girl Bilhah to serve Rachel.[29:30] Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and loved Rachel more than Leah. So he had to serve Laban seven years more.

[29:31] When the LORD  saw that Leah was spurned, he gave her the gift of motherhood; Rachel, however, was barren.[29:32] So Leah gave birth to a son whom she named Reuben^[ Behold a son]; for she said, “The LORD  has seen my affliction; now my husband will love me.”[29:33] She gave birth to another son; and said, “Because the LORD  has heard that I am spurned, he has given me this one also”; and she called his name Simeon^[ Hearing].[29:34] She gave birth to another son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons”; therefore his name was called Levi^[ Attached].[29:35] She gave birth to another son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD ”; therefore she called his name Judah^[ Praise] then she stopped having children.

 [Genesis 30] 

[30:1] When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she was jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, “Give me children or else I will die.”[30:2] But Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place? Who has withheld offspring from you?”[30:3] She said, “Here is my slave-girl Bilhah, go to her, so that she may bear sons who can be laid on my knees and I also may obtain children though her.”[30:4] So she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl for a wife, and Jacob slept with her.[30:5] When Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son,[30:6] Rachel said, “God has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son.” So she called his name Dan^[ He judged].

[30:7] Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.[30:8] Rachel said, “With superhuman wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed”; so she called his name Naphtali^[ Obtained by wrestling].

[30:9] When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took Zilpah her slave-girl, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.[30:10] Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl bore Jacob a son.[30:11] Leah said, “Fortunate!” and she called his name Gad.[30:12] Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,[30:13] and Leah said, “Happy am I! Now women will call me happy”, and she called his name Asher.

[30:14] One time, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”[30:15] But Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband, that you would also take away my son’s mandrakes?” Rachel said, “In exchange for your son’s mandrakes, Jacob can sleep with you tonight.”[30:16] So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You sleep with me tonight, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.

[30:17] God heard Leah’s prayer, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.[30:18] Leah said, “God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave-girl to my husband”; so she called his name Issachar^[ There is a hire].[30:19] Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.[30:20] She said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons”; and she called him Zebulun^[ Dwelling].[30:21] And afterwards she had a daughter and named her Dinah.

[30:22] Then God remembered Rachel and heard her prayer and gave her a child.[30:23] She conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”[30:24] She called his name Joseph^[ He will add], saying, “the LORD  will add to me another son.”

[30:25] When Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, so that I may go to my own place, and to my country.[30:26] Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, so that I may go; for you know the service which I have rendered you.”[30:27] But Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes — I have divined that the LORD  has blessed me for your sake.[30:28] State exactly to me your wages and I will pay them.”

[30:29] Jacob answered him, “You know how I have served you and what your cattle have become under my care;[30:30] for it was little which you had before I came, but now it has greatly increased, since the LORD  has blessed you wherever I went. But now, when am I to provide for my own house as well?”[30:31] Laban said, “What should I give you?”

Jacob said, “You do not need to give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock; I will again keep it.[30:32] If I can go through all your flock today, and remove from it every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these will be my wages.[30:33] So my honesty will testify for me later, when you come to inspect my wages: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs has been stolen by me.”[30:34] Laban said, “Good, let it be as you say.”[30:35] But he removed that day the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were striped and spotted, every one that had white on it, and all the black ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hands of his sons.[30:36] Then he put the distance of a three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.

[30:37] Jacob, however, took fresh rods of white poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.[30:38] He set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink (and they conceived when they came to drink)[30:39] so that the flocks conceived before the rods. Therefore the flocks brought forth striped, speckled and spotted offspring.[30:40] Jacob separated the lambs, and he set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the black animals in the flock of Laban and he put his own droves apart and did not put them near Laban’s flock.

[30:41] Whenever the stronger animals of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the rods.[30:42] But when the animals were weak, he did not put them in.In this way the weaker became Laban’s, and the stronger Jacobs’s.

[30:43] So the man increased in wealth exceedingly, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.

 [Genesis 31] 

[31:1] Now Jacob heard Laban’s sons say, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from that which was our father’s he has acquired all these riches.”[31:2] Now Jacob observed that Laban was not so favorably inclined to him as formerly.[31:3] The LORD  said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your ancestors, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”[31:4] Then Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were,[31:5] and said to them, “I see that your father is not so favorably inclined toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has been with me.[31:6] You know that I have served your father with all my strength.[31:7] Your father, however, has deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm.[31:8] If your father said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled offspring, but if he said: ‘The striped will be your wages,’ then all the flock have striped offspring.[31:9] God has taken away the possessions of your father and given them to me.[31:10] At the time when the flock breed, I looked up, and saw in a dream, that the he-goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and piebald.[31:11] The messenger of God said to me in a dream, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’[31:12] And he said, ‘Look! All the he-goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and piebald: for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.[31:13] I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar of stone, where you made a vow to me. Now arise, leave this land, and return to the land where you were born.’”

[31:14] Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “There is no longer any inheritance for us in our father’s house.[31:15] Are we not considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us and goes on to consume the money paid for us.[31:16] Since all the riches which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children’s, do whatever God has told you to do.”

[31:17] Then Jacob rose up and put his sons and his wives on camels,[31:18] and drove away all his cattle and all the cattle which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.[31:19] And while Laban was gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household gods that were her father’s.[31:20] So Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean — he did not tell him that he was going to flee.[31:21] So he fled with all he had; crossing the river Euphrates heading towards the hill-country of Gilead.

[31:22] When it was reported to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,[31:23] he took his tribesmen with him, and pursued him for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.[31:24] But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him, “Take care that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.”[31:25] When Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country; and Laban with his relatives encamped in same hill country of Gilead.

[31:26] Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of war![31:27] Why did you flee secretly, stealing away from me without telling me? I would have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp —[31:28] but you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters. You have acted foolishly.[31:29] It was in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, ‘Take care that you do not speak to Jacob, neither good nor bad.’[31:30] But now, since you are surely going because you long so earnestly for your father’s house, why have you stolen my gods?”

[31:31] Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.[31:32] The one with whom you find your gods will be put to death; in the presence of our kinsmen investigate for yourself what is with me and take it.” Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s gods.[31:33] So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s, and into the tent of the two slave-girls, but he did not find his gods. Then he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered Rachel’s.[31:34] Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel’s saddle and was sitting on them, so that when Laban had searched all about the tent, he did not find them.[31:35] She said to her father, “Do not be angry that I cannot rise before you, my lord, for it is that time of the month that women have.” And though he searched thoroughly, he did not find the household gods.

[31:36] Then Jacob became angry and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said, “What is my offense, that you have pursued hotly after me?[31:37] Alhough you have gone through all through my things, what have you found of all your household possessions? Declare it here before my kinsmen and yours, so that they may decide which of us two is in the right.[31:38] In all these twenty years that have I been with you, your ewes and she-goats have not miscarried their young, neither did I eat the rams of your flocks.[31:39] I did not bring to you the animals which were killed by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it myself; from my hand you required compensation, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.[31:40] This was how I was: in the day the heat consumed me, and by night the frost, and sleep deserted me.[31:41] These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.[31:42] Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty. But God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and he rebuked you last night.”

[31:43] Then Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine, but what can I do today for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne?[31:44] Come, let us make a solemn agreement, I and you, and let there be a witness between me and you.”

[31:45] So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar,[31:46] and said to the members of his family, “Gather stones.” When they had taken stones and made a heap, they ate there by the heap.[31:47] Laban called it Jegar-sahaduthap^[ Heap of witness]; but Jacob called it Galeed^[ Heap of witness].[31:48] “This heap”, Laban said, “is witness between me and you today.” This is why it was called Galeed,[31:49] and Mizpah^[ Place of watching], for Laban said, “May the LORD  watch between me and you when we are absent one from another,[31:50] so that you may not maltreat my daughters nor take other wives besides my daughters. No one is with us; but beware: God is witness between me and you.”

[31:51] Moreover, Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and the pillar which I have set up between me and you.[31:52] This heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I should not pass beyond this heap to you and that you must not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, with hostile intent.[31:53] The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor” (the God of their ancestors) “judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

[31:54] Then Jacob offered a sacrifice there on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread, and they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.

[31:55] Then early in the morning Laban arose, and, when he had kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them, he departed and returned to his home.

 [Genesis 32] 

[32:1] Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met him.[32:2] When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp;” so he named the place “Mahanaim^[ Company].”

##### Jacob prepares to meet Esau #####

[32:3] Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, which is the territory of the Edomites.[32:4] He gave them this command, “Say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob declares, I have lived with Laban and have stayed until now.[32:5] I have oxen and donkeys, flocks and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may win your favor.’”[32:6] The messengers returned to Jacob with the report, “We came to your brother Esau, even as he was coming to meet you with four hundred men.”

[32:7] Then Jacob was greatly alarmed and worried. So he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two parts[32:8] and said, “If Esau comes to the one and attacks and destroys it, then the other which is left can escape.”

[32:9] Jacob also prayed, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, LORD  who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do well by you,’[32:10] I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the faithfulness which you have shown to me, your servant. I passed over the Jordan river with only my staff, and now I have these two groups,[32:11] deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear that he will come and attack me and kill the mothers and the children.[32:12] Remember your promise to make me prosper and my descendants as many as the sand of the seashore, uncountable.”

[32:13] After spending the night there, Jacob took from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau,[32:14] two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,[32:15] thirty milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten young donkeys.[32:16] These he put, each drove by itself, in the care of his servants and said to them, “Go on before me and leave a space between the droves.”

[32:17] He gave those in front this command: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose are these before you?’[32:18] then you shall say, ‘To your servant Jacob; it is a present sent by him to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is just behind us.’”[32:19] Jacob also commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, to make the same answer,[32:20] and to say, “Jacob himself is just behind us.” For he said to himself, “I will please him with the present that goes before me, and then, when I meet him, perhaps he will welcome me.”[32:21] So he sent the present over before him; but he himself spent that night in the camp.

[32:22] Later that night he rose up and took his two wives, his two slave-girls, and his eleven children, and sent them over the river Jabbok.

##### Jacob wrestles #####

[32:23] After he had sent them accross with all his belongings,[32:24] Jacob was left alone, and someone wrestled with him until daybreak.[32:25] When he saw that he did not win against Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated, as he wrestled with him.[32:26] Then he said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”[32:27] So he said to him, “What is your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”[32:28] Then he said, “Your name shall be no longer Jacob, but Israel^[ which means Struggler with God]; for you have struggled with God and with mortals and have won.”[32:29] Jacob asked him, “Tell me, I pray, your name.” He said,“Why do you ask my name?” So he blessed him there.[32:30] Jacob called the place Penuel^[ which means Face of God], for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life has been saved.”

[32:31] The sun rose as soon as he had passed beyond Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.[32:32] This is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle, which is at the socket of the hip, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip on the thigh muscle.

 [Genesis 33] 

##### Reconciliation #####

[33:1] When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two slave-girls.[33:2] He put the slave-girls and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son Joseph in the rear.[33:3] Then Jacob himself went in front of them, and he bowed down to the ground seven times, as he drew near to his brother.[33:4] Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms about his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.

[33:5] When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “The children whom God has so kindly given me.”[33:6] Then the slave-girls with their children came up and bowed down to the ground.[33:7] Leah and her children also came and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed down before Esau.

[33:8] Esau asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob answered, “To win your friendship, my lord.”[33:9] Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have.”[33:10] But Jacob replied, “No, if now I have won your favor, receive this present from me, because seeing your face when you welcomed me was like seeing the face of God.[33:11] Take, I beg of you, the gift that I bring to you, for God has been generous to me and I have enough.” So he urged Esau until he took it.

[33:12] Then Esau said, “Let us set out on our way, and let me travel with you.”[33:13] But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are delicate, and I have flocks and herds with their young; if they are overdriven one day, all the flocks will die.[33:14] Let my lord, I beg of you, go on ahead of me, and I will proceed leisurely by stages according to the pace of the cattle which I am driving and of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”[33:15] Then Esau said, “Let me at least leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob replied, “What need is there? Let me only enjoy the favor of my lord.”[33:16] So Esau turned back that day on his way to Seir.

[33:17] But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built there a house for himself, and made huts for his cattle; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth^[ Huts].

##### Dinah and Shechem #####

[33:18] Now Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-Aram, and encamped before the city.[33:19] He bought the piece of ground where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for four hundred shekels;[33:20] and he erected there an altar and called it El, God of Israel.

 [Genesis 34] 

[34:1] Dinah the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of the region.[34:2] When Sheeham the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her and violated her,[34:3] but his heart was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob — he loved her and spoke endearingly to her.[34:4] Therefore Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl for my wife.”

[34:5] When Jacob heard that Shecham had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob said nothing until they came home.[34:6] Meanwhile Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him and with his sons.

[34:7] The sons of Jacob came in from the field, and when they heard the news, the men were indignant and became very angry, because Shechem had committed a shameful crime in raping Jacob’s daughter: such a thing ought never to be done.[34:8] Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. I beg you: give her to him as a wife[34:9] and intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.[34:10] Then you can settle with us, and the land will be open before you. Remain, go about, and settle down in it.”

[34:11] And Shechem said to Dinah’s father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and I will give you what you ask of me.[34:12] Demand of me an exceedingly large gift for yourselves and a dowry for the bride, and I shall give all you ask of me; only give me the girl for my wife.”

[34:13] Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, declaring, (because he had defiled their sister Dinah),[34:14] “We cannot do this. We cannot give our sister to someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.[34:15] Only on this condition will we make an alliance with you: if you will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.[34:16] Then will we give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and will live with you and we will become one people.[34:17] But if you will not listen to us and allow yourselves to be circumcised, then we will take Dinah and be gone.”

[34:18] Their proposal pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.[34:19] The young man (who was honored above all the house of his father) did not hesitate to do the thing demanded, because he was smitten with Jacob’s daughter.[34:20] Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying,[34:21] “These men are peaceably disposed toward us, let them remain in the land and go about in it; the land is broad enough for them on every side and in every direction; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.[34:22] Only on this condition will these men consent to settle with us to become one people, namely, that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.[34:23] Shouldn’t their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? Let us make an alliance with them so that they will live with us.”[34:24] Then all who went in and out of the gate of his city agreed with Hamor and Shechem. And every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

[34:25] On the third day when they were still in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took swords and came upon the city unawares,[34:26] and put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went away.[34:27] The other sons of Jacob came on the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.[34:28] They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and all that which was in the city and all that which was in the field.[34:29] All their wealth, and all their children and their wives, they took captive, and made all that was in the houses their prey.[34:30] Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought me into trouble, in that you have made me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. Since I have only a few people, if they gather themselves together against me they will attack me — and I and my house will be destroyed.”[34:31] But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a whore?”

 [Genesis 35] 

##### Jacob goes to Bethel #####

[35:1] Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”[35:2] So Jacob said to his household, and to everyone who was with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.[35:3] Let us arise and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the journey which I was making.”[35:4] So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their possession, and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.[35:5] They set out on their journey, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.[35:6] Then Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is, Bethel). He and all the people that were with him came to Bethel.[35:7] He built there an altar, and named the place El-Bethel^[ The God of the house of God]; because there God revealed himself to him, when he fled from the presence of his brother.[35:8] Then Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried below Bethel under the oak. Therefore its name was called Allon-bacuth^[ Oak of Weeping].

[35:9] God appeared again to Jacob when he came from Paddanaram, and blessed him.[35:10] God said to him, “Now your name is Jacob: but your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel.” So he called his name Israel.[35:11] God said to him, “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and become numerous; a nation and a multitude of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you;[35:12] and the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and to your descendants after you.”[35:13] God went up from him at that place where he spoke with him.[35:14] Jacob set up at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and poured a drink-offering and oil on it.[35:15] Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.

[35:16] Then they set out from Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into a hard and painful labor.[35:17] At the hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son.”[35:18] And, as her life was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni^[ Son of my Sorrow]; but his father called him Benjamin^[ Son of the right hand].[35:19] So Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),[35:20] and Jacob set up a pillar on her grave: that is the Pillar of Rachel’s Grave, which stands until this day.

[35:21] Then Israel journeyed, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-Eder^[ Tower of the Flock].[35:22] While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah and Israel heard of it.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:[35:23] The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;[35:24] the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;[35:25] and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl: Dan and Naphtali;[35:26] and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl: Gad and Asher (these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram).

[35:27] Then Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.[35:28] The length of Isaac’s life was a one hundred and eighty years.[35:29] Isaac beathed his last, and was gathered to his father’s kin, old and satisfied with life; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

 [Genesis 36] 

##### Genealogy #####

[36:1] Now these are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom).[36:2] Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,[36:3] and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.[36:4] Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; and Basemath bore Reuel;[36:5] and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau that were born to him in the land of Canaan.

[36:6] Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the members of his household and his cattle and all his beasts and all his possessionse which he had gathered in the land of Canaan and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.[36:7] For their possessions were too many for them to live together; and the land where they sojourned could not support them because of their cattle.[36:8] So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir (Esau is Edom).

[36:9] These are the descendants of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir:[36:10] these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.[36:11] The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.[36:12] Timna was the concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz; and she bore Amalek to him. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah.[36:13] These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.[36:14] These were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Esau’s wife Zibeon she bore Jeush to Esau, and Jalam, and Korah.

[36:15] These are the chiefs descended from Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,[36:16] chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah.[36:17] These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.[36:18] These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.[36:19] These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.

[36:20] These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the original inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,[36:21] and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.[36:22] The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna.[36:23] These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.[36:24] These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of his father Zibeon.[36:25] These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.[36:26] These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.[36:27] These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.[36:28] These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.[36:29] These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,[36:30] chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.

[36:31] These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the Israelites.[36:32] Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.[36:33] Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.[36:34] Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.[36:35] Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead. The name of his city was Avith.[36:36] Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.[36:37] Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.[36:38] Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.[36:39] Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.

[36:40] These are the names of the chiefs decended from Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,[36:41] chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,[36:42] chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,[36:43] chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. This was Esau, the father of the Edomites.

 [Genesis 37] 

##### Joseph sold into slavery #####

[37:1] Jacob made his home in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived as a resident foreigner.[37:2] Joseph at the age of seventeen was a shepherd with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s slave wives. He brought a bad report about them to their father.[37:3] Now Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.[37:4] When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all his other sons, they hated him and could not speak to him in a friendly manner.

[37:5] Joseph also had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they hated him still more.[37:6] This is what he said to them, “Hear, if you will, this dream which I have had;[37:7] for as we were binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing, while your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf.”[37:8] His brothers said to him, “Do you think you will be king over us? And rule us?” So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words.

[37:9] Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “I have had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.”[37:10] But when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and said, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Am I and your mother and your brothers supposed to bow down to the earth before you?”[37:11] Therefore his brothers envied him; but his father kept the matter in mind.

[37:12] When his brothers went to pasture his father’s flocks in Shechem,[37:13] Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks in Shechem? Come now, I will send you to them.” Joseph replied, “I am ready.”[37:14] So his father said to him, “Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me back word.” So he sent him out from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.[37:15] There a man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”[37:16] He said, “I am looking for my brothers; tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.”[37:17] The man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.

[37:18] When they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they conspired against him to kill him.[37:19] They said one to another, “See, here comes that master-dreamer.[37:20] Come on, let us kill him, and throw him into one of the pits, and then we will say, ‘A fierce beast has devoured him’; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!”[37:21] Rueben, however, when he heard it, saved him from their hands by saying, “Let us not take his life.”[37:22] Reuben also said to them, “Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit, that is in the wilderness; but do not harm him,” He planned to save him from their hands in order to restore him to his father.[37:23] Nevertheless, when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his long robe, the robe with sleeves;[37:24] and they took him and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty, there being no water in it.

[37:25] Then they sat down to eat bread, and when they looked up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt.[37:26] Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?[37:27] Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do him no violence, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” So his brothers listened to him;[37:28] and when the Midianite merchants passed by, pulled Joseph up from the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt.

[37:29] When Reuben returned to the pit and found Joseph gone, he tore his clothes in sorrow.[37:30] He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”

[37:31] Then his brothers took Joseph’s robe, killed a he-goat, dipped the long-sleeved robe in the blood,[37:32] tore it and sent it to their father, saying, “We found this; see whether it is your son’s robe or not.”[37:33] He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph without doubt is torn in pieces.”[37:34] Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his waist, and mourned for his son many days.[37:35] All his sons and his daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, “I shall go down to the grave mourning for my son.” So Joseph’s father wept for him.

[37:36] Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to one of Pharaoh’s court officials, Potiphar, the captain of the guard.

 [Genesis 38] 

##### Judah and Tamar #####

[38:1] About that time Judah left his kinsmen, and settled near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.[38:2] Judah saw there a daughter of a Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her. He lay with her,[38:3] and she conceived, and bore a son, and he named him Er.[38:4] Then she conceived again, and bore a son and named him Onan.[38:5] She bore still another son, and named him Shelah: and it was at Chezib that she bore him.

[38:6] Now Judah found a wife for Er his eldest son, and her name was Tamar.[38:7] But Er, Judah’s eldest son, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD  took his life.[38:8] Then Judah said to Onan, “Go and lie with your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”[38:9] But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, in order not to raise up offspring for his brother.[38:10] What he did was evil in the sight of the LORD : therefore he took his life also.

[38:11] Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah my son is grown up”; for he said to himself, “I will not let him marry her, he must not die like his brothers.” So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.

[38:12] After many days had passed, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to see about his sheep-shearers at Timnah, with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.[38:13] Someone told Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”[38:14] She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil. She sat, veiled, in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up without her being given to him as wife.[38:15] When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; because she had veiled her face.[38:16] So he turned aside to her by the roadside, and said, “Permit me, I pray you, to lie with you.” For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me to lie with me?”[38:17] He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”[38:18] He said, “What pledge should I give you?” And she said, “Your seal-ring and your chain and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her, and lay with her, and she became pregnant.[38:19] And she got up, and went away, and took off her veil, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

[38:20] Now when Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her.[38:21] He asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the sacred prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside?” They replied, “There has been no sacred prostitute here.”[38:22] So he returned to Judah, and said, “I have not found her; and the men of the place said, ‘There has been no sacred prostitute here.’”[38:23] Judah said, “Let her keep the pledge, otherwise we will be put to shame. I have sent this goat, and you have not found her.”

[38:24] Now after about three months, Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore and is pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her forth and let her be burnt.”[38:25] But when she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these things belong, I am with child.” She also said, “Look at them and see if you know whose these are, the seal-ring and the chain and the staff.”[38:26] When Judah recognized them, he said, “She is more in the right than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” But he did not lie with her again.

[38:27] When her time came to give birth, it was found that twins were in her womb.[38:28] While she was in labor, one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound on his hand a bright red thread, saying, “This one came out first.”[38:29] But he drew back his hand, and his brother came out, and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore he was named Perez^[ Breach].[38:30] Afterward his brother came out, who had the bright red thread on his hand; therefore he was named Zerah^[ Red].

 [Genesis 39] 

##### Joseph in Egypt #####

[39:1] Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officers, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.

[39:2] Now the LORD  was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he remained in the house of his master the Egyptian.[39:3] When his master saw that the LORD  was with him and made everything that he undertook prosper,[39:4] Joseph won his confidence and became his personal attendant. He also made him overseer of his household and placed all that he had in his care.[39:5] From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD  blessed the Egyptian’s household for Joseph’s sake, and the blessing of the LORD  was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.[39:6] Leaving all that he had in Joseph’s charge, he knew nothing about his affairs except about the food which he ate. Also Joseph was handsome and attractive.

[39:7] After these honors had come to Joseph, his master’s wife directed her glances toward him and tried to tempt him.[39:8] But he refused, saying to her, “See, my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all that he has in my charge.[39:9] No one has greater authority in this house than I, and he has kept back nothing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wrong and sin against God?”[39:10] Day after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to her nor accept her advances.[39:11] One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and when none of the men of the household were at home,[39:12] she caught hold of his garment and tried to seduce him; but he left his garment in her hand and fled out of the house.

[39:13] When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled,[39:14] she called to her household servants and said to them,“See, the master has brought a Hebrew in to insult us. He came to me to rape me, and I screamed loudly;[39:15] and when he heard me scream, he left his garment with me and ran out of the house.”[39:16] She kept his garment by her until his master came home;[39:17] then she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult me;[39:18] and when I screamed he left his garment with me and fled.”

[39:19] When Joseph’s master heard the statements which his wife made to him, his anger was aroused;[39:20] and he took Joseph and put him into the prison, in the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So he was left there in prison.[39:21] But the LORD  was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and enabled him to win the favor of the keeper of the prison,[39:22] so that he placed all the prisoners in Joseph’s charge and made him responsible for whatever they did there.[39:23] The keeper did not have to concern himself about anything Joseph was responsible for, because the LORD  was with him and gave him success in everything he did.

 [Genesis 40] 

##### The Two Dreams #####

[40:1] Some time after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their master the king of Egypt,[40:2] so that Pharaoh was angry with these two officers and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.[40:3] The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he waited on them;[40:4] and they remained in confinement for some time.

[40:5] Meanwhile the king of Egypt’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a particular meaning.[40:6] When Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they were sad.[40:7] So he asked Pharaoh’s officers, “Why do you look so sad today?”[40:8] They answered. “We have had a dream and there is no one who can interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not the interpretations of dreams belong to God? Tell them to me.”

[40:9] Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine before me,[40:10] and on the vine were three branches, and as if budding it put out blossoms and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.[40:11] Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.”

[40:12] Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;[40:13] within three days Pharaoh will release you from prison and restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.[40:14] But when all goes well with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak in my behalf to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house;[40:15] for I was unjustly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.”

[40:16] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also saw something in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head,[40:17] and in the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”[40:18] Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;[40:19] within three days Pharaoh will take off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your flesh.”

[40:20] Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his officials. Then he released the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.[40:21] He restored the chief butler to his office, so that he again gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand,[40:22] but the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.[40:23] Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

 [Genesis 41] 

##### Pharaoh’s Dream #####

[41:1] Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the Nile,[41:2] he saw coming up from the Nile seven cows, good-looking and fat, and they had been feeding in the river grass.[41:3] Then seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, bad-looking and lean, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.[41:4] The bad-looking cows ate up the seven good-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

[41:5] Afterward he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and good, growing up on one stalk.[41:6] Also seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up after them.[41:7] The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and realized that it was a dream.

[41:8] In the morning Pharaoh’s mind was disturbed; so he sent and called all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him.

[41:9] Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I now must remind you of my offenses:[41:10] Pharaoh was very angry with his servants and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.[41:11] We both had dreams the same night, each with a special meaning.[41:12] There was also with us a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guard; and we told him and he interpreted our dreams to us, to each of us according to his dream.[41:13] Our dreams came true exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.”

[41:14] Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved his face and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh.[41:15] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”[41:16] Joseph answered Pharaoh, “Not I; God only can give Pharaoh a satisfactory answer.”

[41:17] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream as I stood on the bank of the Nile,[41:18] I saw seven cows, fat and good-looking, which had been feeding in the river grass.[41:19] There came up after them seven more cows, thin, and bad-looking and lean, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt;[41:20] and the lean and bad-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows;[41:21] and when they had eaten them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were still as bad-looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke.[41:22] Again I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one stalk;[41:23] then seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprang up after them;[41:24] and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it to me.”

[41:25] Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s two dreams signify the same thing; God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do.[41:26] The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one dream.[41:27] The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are also seven years, and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind represent seven years of famine.[41:28] That is why I said to Pharaoh, ‘God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.’[41:29] Seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt are coming,[41:30] and they will be followed by seven years of famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume all that the land produces;[41:31] and plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.

[41:32] “The dream came twice to Pharaoh to indicate that its fulfilment is assured and that God will soon make it come true.[41:33] Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discreet and wise and place him in control of the land of Egypt.[41:34] Pharaoh should take action and appoint overseers over the land and collect one-fifth of all the produce of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.[41:35] Let them gather all the food of these good years that come and store the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them hold it for food in the cities.[41:36] The food will furnish a supply for the land during the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, so that the people of the land will not perish because of the famine.”

[41:37] The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his officials;[41:38] and Pharaoh said to his officials, “Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?”[41:39] So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.[41:40] You will be at the head of my dominion, and all my people shall be ruled as you command, only on the throne I will be superior to you.”

[41:41] So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have appointed you over all the land of Egypt.”[41:42] Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his finger and put it upon Joseph’s finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a golden collar about his neck.[41:43] He also made him ride in the second-best chariot which he had; and they cried before him, “Attention!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.

[41:44] Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one may lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”[41:45] Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Josephs’s authority was over all Egypt,[41:46] and so at the age of thirty Joseph was commissioned by Pharaoh, king of Egypt and went out as the head of the land of Egypt.

[41:47] In the seven plenteous years there were bountiful harvests,[41:48] and Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven plenteous years, which were in the land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city the products of the fields about it.[41:49] Joseph stored up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he ceased to keep account, because it could not be measured.

[41:50] Two sons were born to Joseph and Asenath before the year of famine came.[41:51] Joseph named the eldest Manasseh^[ Making Forget]; for he said, “God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s household.”[41:52] He named the second son Ephraim^[ Fruitful]; for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”

[41:53] When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were over,[41:54] the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food,[41:55] for when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”[41:56] So when the famine was universal throughout the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians: but the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.[41:57] The peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe throughout the world.

 [Genesis 42] 

##### Joseph’s brothers come to Egypt #####

[42:1] Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, and he said to his sons, “Why do you stand looking at each other?[42:2] I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy for us, so that we may live and not die.”[42:3] So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.[42:4] But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s own brother, with his brothers; for he feared that some harm might come to him.[42:5] So the sons of Jacob went among others to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

[42:6] Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Therefore Joseph’s brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth.[42:7] When Joseph saw his brothers he knew them, but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, “Where do you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”[42:8] So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not know him.

[42:9] Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them and said to them, “You spies! You have come to find out the weaknesses of the land.”[42:10] But they said to him, “No my lord; your servants have come to buy food.[42:11] We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.”[42:12] But he said to them, “No, you have come to see the weaknesses of the land.”[42:13] They replied, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”[42:14] Joseph said to them, “It is just as I said to you, you are spies.[42:15] By this you shall be tested: as sure as Pharaoh lives you shall not go away unless your youngest brother comes here.[42:16] Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that it may be proved whether you are telling the truth or not. Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.”[42:17] So he put them all into prison for three days.

[42:18] Then Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God:[42:19] if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain in prison, but you go, carry grain to supply the needs of your households[42:20] and bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and you shall not die.”

[42:21] They did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, “We are indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw his distress and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen; therefore this trouble has come upon us.”[42:22] Reuben added, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’ but you would not listen? Therefore now his very blood is required.”[42:23] They did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had spoken to them through an interpreter.[42:24] But he turned away from them and wept; then he turned back and spoke to them, and, taking Simeon from among them, bound him before their eyes.[42:25] Then Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with grain and to restore each man’s money to his sack and to give them provision for the journey; and it was done to them.

[42:26] So they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed.[42:27] When they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw the silver at the top of the sack.[42:28] He said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned; here it is in my pack.” They were dismayed and fearful, and said to one another, “What has God done to us?”

[42:29] When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened, saying,[42:30] “The man who is master in that land spoke harshly to us and imprisoned us as spies.[42:31] We said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies;[42:32] we are twelve brothers, sons of the same father; one is no longer living, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’[42:33] But the man who is master in that land said to us, ‘This is how I will discover if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take the grain to supply the needs of your households and depart.[42:34] Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men; and I will restore your brother to you and you shall be free to go about in the land.’”

[42:35] As they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man’s purse of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their purses filled with money, they were afraid.[42:36] Jacob their father said to them, “You have robbed me of my children: Joseph is no longer living and Simeon is no longer here, and you would take Benjamin also. All this misfortune has overtaken me!”[42:37] But Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death, if I do not return him to you. Put him in my charge and I will bring him back to you.”[42:38] But Jacob said, “My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he only is left. If harm should come to him on the way by which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.”

 [Genesis 43] 

[43:1] The famine was severe in the land;[43:2] and when Joseph’s brothers had eaten all the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, and buy us some more grain.”[43:3] But Judah replied, “The man warned us: ‘You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.’[43:4] If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and buy you food,[43:5] but if you will not let him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.’”[43:6] Jacob said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?”[43:7] They replied, “The man asked particularly about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ So we answered his questions as he asked them. How were we to know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”

[43:8] Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that both we and you and our little ones may live and not die.[43:9] I will be surety for him, you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;[43:10] for if we had not lingered, surely we would now have returned the second time.”[43:11] Therefore their father said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the products of the land in your jars and carry down a present to the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.[43:12] Take twice as much money with you, carrying back the money that was returned in your sacks; perhaps there was a mistake.[43:13] Take also your brother and go again to the man,[43:14] and may God Almighty grant that the man may be merciful to you and release Benjamin and your other brother. But if I am robbed of my sons, I am bereaved indeed!”[43:15] So the men took the present and twice as much money and Benjamin, and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.

[43:16] When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, kill animals, and prepare the meal, for these men will eat with me at noon.”[43:17] He did as Joseph directed, and brought the men into Joseph’s house.[43:18] But the brothers were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house, and they said, “We are being brought in on account of the money that was returned in our grain-saeks at our first visit, so that he can overpower and arrest us and take us as slaves, together with our donkeys.”

[43:19] So when they came near to Joseph’s steward, they spoke to him at the door of the house[43:20] and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time only to buy food;[43:21] and when we reached home, we opened our sacks and discovered every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back with us.[43:22] We have also brought down with us other money with which to buy food; we do not know who put our money into our sacks.”[43:23] He replied, “Be calm, don’t be afraid; your God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks; I received your full payment.”

Then he brought Simeon out to them.[43:24] The steward also conducted the men to Joseph’s house and gave them water with which to wash their feet, and he gave their donkeys fodder.[43:25] Then they made ready the present in anticipation of Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat there.

[43:26] When Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they had brought and bowed down low before him.[43:27] He asked them regarding their welfare and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still living?”[43:28] They replied, “Your servant, our father, is well; he is still alive.” Then they bowed their heads and made obeisance.

[43:29] When Joseph looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, his own mother’s son, he said. “Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?” and he added, “God be gracious to you, my son.”[43:30] Then because he was overcome with emotion for his brother he sought a place to weep; and he went into his room and wept there.[43:31] Then he bathed his face and came out and controlling himself he said, “Bring on the food.”[43:32] So they brought food for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for to do so is abhorrent to the Egyptians.[43:33] Joseph’s brothers were seated before him, the eldest according to his right as the oldest and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at each other in astonishment.[43:34] Then Joseph had portions served to them from the food before him; but Benjamin’s portions were five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.

 [Genesis 44] 

[44:1] Then he gave this command to the steward of his household: “Fill the men’s grain-sacks with food, as much as they can carry,[44:2] and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money too that he paid for his grain.” He did as Joseph commanded.

[44:3] As soon as the morning light appeared, the men were sent away, together with their donkeys.[44:4] When they had gone out of the city, but were not yet far away, Joseph commanded his steward, “Follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good?[44:5] Why have you stolen my silver cup, that from which my master drinks and by which he divines the future? You have done wrong in so doing!’”

[44:6] So the steward overtook them and said these words to them.[44:7] They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as this? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing![44:8] Remember that we brought back to you from the hind of Canaan the money which we found in our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?[44:9] If one of us is found with the goblet then let him die, and we will be my lord’s slaves.”[44:10] He said, “Let it now be as you have said: he with whom it is found will be my slave; but the rest may go free.”[44:11] Then each one hastily took down his sack to the ground and opened it;[44:12] and the steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.[44:13] Then they tore their clothes in sorrow, and every man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.

[44:14] When Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they threw themselves before him on the ground.[44:15] Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can divine secrets?”[44:16] Judah replied, “What can we say, my lord? What can we plead or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. See, both we and he also in whose possession the cup was found are my lord’s slaves.”[44:17] But Joseph said, “Far be it from me that I should do such a thing! The man in whose possession the cup was found must be my slave; but you yourselves go up in peace to your father.”

[44:18] Then Judah came close to him and said, “My lord, let your servant, I beg of you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger be kindled against your servant; for you are as great as Pharaoh.[44:19] My lord, you asked us, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’[44:20] And we said to you, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. Since his brother is dead, he is the only son of his mother who is left; and his father loves him.’[44:21] You said to us, ‘Bring him down to me, so that I can see him.’[44:22] But we said to you, my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he should leave his father, his father would die.’[44:23] Then you said to us, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not be able to see me again.’[44:24] When we went up to your servant, my father, we told him your words, my lord;[44:25] and our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food.’[44:26] But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go; for we cannot see the man unless our youngest brother is with us.’[44:27] And your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;[44:28] and one went missing, and I said that surely he was torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since.[44:29] If you take this one also from me, and harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.’[44:30] Now if I return to your servant, my father, and the boy with whose life his heart is bound up is not with us,[44:31] then when he sees that there is no boy, he will die, and we, your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.[44:32] Indeed, my lord, I personally became surety for the boy to my father, when I said, ‘If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame in my father’s eyes forever.’[44:33] Now therefore let me, I beg of you, remain instead of the boy as your slave, my lord, but let the boy go up with his brothers.[44:34] For how can I go up to my father, if the boy is not with me, and see the pain and sorrow that would come upon my father.”

 [Genesis 45] 

[45:1] Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who were standing by him; so he cried out, “Let everyone leave me.” So nobody stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.[45:2] But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh’s court heard.

[45:3] Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him for they were frightened in his presence.[45:4] Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, I beg of you.” So they came near. And he said, “I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt.[45:5] Do not be troubled nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here, because God sent me before you to preserve life.[45:6] For the famine has already been two years in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest.[45:7] God sent me before you to keep you alive through a great deliverance and give you descendants on the earth.[45:8] So now it clear that it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.

[45:9] “Go up quickly to my father and say to him, ‘Your son Joseph says: God has made me master of all Egypt, come down to me without delay.[45:10] You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me with your children and children’s children, with your flocks and your herds and all that you have,[45:11] and there I will provide for you. Otherwise you, together with your household and all that you have, will starve; for there will be five more years of famine.’[45:12] Now you and my brother Benjamin see that it is really me, Joseph, who is speaking to you.[45:13] Tell my father all about my honor in Egypt and what you have seen, and you must quickly bring him down here.”

[45:14] Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.[45:15] He also kissed all his brothers and wept with them; and after that his brothers talked with him.

[45:16] The report that Joseph’s brothers had arrived spread in Pharaoh’s palace, and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants greatly.[45:17] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts, go to the land of Canaan,[45:18] and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the best that the land affords.[45:19] Now you are commanded to do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.[45:20] Also pay no attention to your household goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”[45:21] The sons of Jacob did as commanded.

So Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharaoh’s orders and provisions for the journey.[45:22] To each of them he gave a change of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.[45:23] To his father he sent the following gifts: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father on the journey.

[45:24] So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “See that you do not quarrel on the journey!”[45:25] So they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.[45:26] They told him, “Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Then Jacob’s heart stood still, for he could not believe them.[45:27] But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived,[45:28] and he, Israel, said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”

 [Genesis 46] 

##### The promise to Israel #####

[46:1] Then Israel set out on his journey with all that he had. He went to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.[46:2] God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” He answered. “Here I am.”[46:3] Then God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.[46:4] I myself will go down with you into Egypt; and I will surely bring you up again; and Joseph will be the one who closes your dying eyes.”

[46:5] When Jacob left Beersheba, his sons carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.[46:6] They took their herds and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his family;[46:7] his sons and grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, he brought all his family to Egypt.

##### Geneaology #####

[46:8] Now these are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his family, who came to Egypt. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn,[46:9] and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.[46:10] The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.[46:11] The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.[46:12] The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul.[46:13] The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.[46:14] The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.[46:15] These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah. He had thirty-three descendants by Leah in total.[46:16] The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.[46:17] The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.[46:18] These are the children of Zilpah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She bore sixteen children to Jacob.[46:19] The children of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.[46:20] Joseph in the land of Egypt fathered Manasseh and Ephraim, whose mother was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.[46:21] The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.[46:22] These fourteen were Rachel and Jacobs’s descendants.[46:23] The sons of Dan: Hashum.[46:24] The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.[46:25] These seven are the sons of Bilhah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore seven children to Jacob.

[46:26] All the people belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including the wives of his sons, were sixty-six in total.[46:27] Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt; all the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.

##### Israel in Egypt #####

[46:28] Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, so that he might show him the way to Goshen.[46:29] When they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father, and when he presented himself to him Jacob fell on his neck and wept there a long time.

[46:30] Then Jacob said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”[46:31] But Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.[46:32] Now the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all that they have.’[46:33] When Pharaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’[46:34] you must say, ‘We, your servants have been keepers of cattle all our lives, both we and our fathers,’ so that you might be allowed to live in the province of Goshen, for shepherds are looked down upon by the Egyptians.”

 [Genesis 47] 

[47:1] Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.”[47:2] He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.[47:3] Pharaoh said to them, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “We are shepherds, both we and our fathers.”[47:4] They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land, because there is no pasture for our flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. We beg of you, to let us stay in the province of Goshen.”[47:5] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since your father and your brothers have come to you,[47:6] the land of Egypt is at your disposal. Settle them in the best part of it. Let them stay in the province of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.”

[47:7] Joseph also brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.[47:8] Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”[47:9] Jacob answered, “I have lived a hundred and thirty years; few and hard have been the years of my life, and they have not been as many as those that my ancestors lived on earth.”[47:10] After Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh’s presence.[47:11] So Joseph gave his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, near Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

[47:12] Joseph also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his father’s household according to the number of their little children.

[47:13] There was no bread in all the land; since the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.[47:14] Joseph gathered in all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.

[47:15] When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread: for why should we die before your eyes because our money fails?”[47:16] Then Joseph said, “Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money has failed.”[47:17] So they brought their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their cattle.

[47:18] And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from you, my lord, now that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are yours; there is nothing left in the your sight, but our bodies and our lands.[47:19] Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Take possession of us and our land in return for bread, and we and our land will become personal possessions of Pharaoh; and give us seed, so that we will live, and not die, so that the land does not become desolate.”

[47:20] So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s.[47:21] As for the people, he reduced them to slavery from one end of Egypt to the other.[47:22] Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had a definite allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Hence they did not sell their land.

[47:23] Then Joseph said to the people, “I have bought you and you land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land.[47:24] At the ingatherings, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed for the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.”[47:25] They replied, “You have saved our lives; let us find favor in your sight, lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”[47:26] So Joseph made it a law, still in force today, that Pharaoh should have a fifth; only the land of the priests did not come into the possession of Pharaoh.

[47:27] The Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired possessions in it and had many children and became exceedingly numerous.[47:28] Jacob lived for seventeen years in Egypt and died at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.

##### Deaths of Jacob and Joseph #####

[47:29] When the time drew near for Jacob to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now you will do me a favor, put your hand under my thigh and swear that you will act kindly and faithfully with me. Do not bury me, I beg of you, in Egypt;[47:30] but when I lie down to sleep with my ancestors, carry, me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place.” Joseph replied, “I will do as you have requested.”[47:31] Jacob said, “Give me your oath”; so Joseph gave him his oath; and Israel bowed toward the head of the bed.

 [Genesis 48] 

[48:1] Now after these things, Joseph was told, “Your father is sick.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.[48:2] When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Jacob rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.[48:3] Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,[48:4] and said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful, and numerous, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’[48:5] Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.[48:6] But your offspring, which you father after them, will be yours. Their inheritance will come from their older brothers.[48:7] As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, some distance from Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”

[48:8] When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”[48:9] And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” Israel said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.[48:10] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.[48:11] Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and now God has let me see your offspring as well.”[48:12] Joseph took them from his father’s lap, and bowed with his face to the earth.

[48:13] So Joseph took them both — Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand — and brought them near to him.[48:14] Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands intentionally, for Manasseh was the eldest.

[48:15] He then blessed Joseph, saying, “The God whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac revered and served, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long unto this day,[48:16] the messenger who has delivered me from all evil, bless the boys; and let them be known as descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.”

[48:17] But when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he seized his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.[48:18] Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; this one is the eldest; put your right hand upon his head.”[48:19] But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know, he also will become a people, and he will shall be great, but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a populous nation.”[48:20] So he blessed them that day and said, “The Israelites will invoke a blessing like your own, saying, ‘God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.

[48:21] Jacob said to Joseph, “See, I am about to die; but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.[48:22] As well I give you a mountain-slope which I took out of the power of the Amorites with my sword and bow.”

 [Genesis 49] 

[49:1] Jacob summoned his sons and said, “Come near, so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.”

|  [49:2] Assemble, sons of Jacob,
|  and listen to Israel your father.

|  [49:3] Reuben you are my first-born,
|  my strength and the first-fruit of my manhood.
|  First in dignity and strength.
|  [49:4] Boiling over like water, you will not be first,
|  For you climbed into my concubine’s the bed,
|  you defiled your father’s couch.

|  [49:5] Simeon and Levi are akin,
|  weapons of violence are their swords.
|  I will not enter into their council,
|  [49:6] My heart will not join in their assembly,
|  for men in their anger they slew.
|  and oxen in their wantonness they hamstrung.
|  [49:7] Accursed is their anger that it is so fierce,
|  and their wrath because it is so cruel;
|  I will divide them in Jacob
|  and scatter them in Israel.

|  [49:8] Judah, your brothers praise you!
|  Your hand is on the neck of your enemies.
|  Before you your father’s sons bow down.
|  [49:9] Judah is a whelp of a lion.
|  From the kill, my son, you have returned;
|  He has crouched, he has lain down as a lion,
|  as an old lion, who will disturb him?
|  [49:10] The sceptre will not pass from Judah,
|  nor the royal staff from between his feet,
|  and to him is due the obedience of the people.
|  [49:11] Binding his donkey to the vine,
|  and his colt to the choice vine,
|  he has washed his garments in wine,
|  and his clothing in the blood of grapes.
|  [49:12] His eyes are red with wine,
|  and his teeth are white with milk.

|  [49:13] Zebulun, he lives by the seashore;
|  he is by a shore that is lined with ships,
|  and his border extends to Sidon.

|  [49:14] Issachar, he is a strong-limbed donkey,
|  crouching down between the sheepfolds,
|  [49:15] and when he saw the resting place was good,
|  that the land also was pleasant,
|  he bowed his shoulder to bear,
|  and became a slave under a taskmaster.

|  [49:16] Dan, he judges his own people
|  as one of the tribes of Israel.
|  [49:17] Dan is a serpent by the way,
|  a horned-adder beside the path
|  that bites the horse’s heel
|  so that his rider is thrown off.
|  [49:18] I have waited for your deliverance LORD !

|  [49:19] Gad, robber-bands press upon him,
|  but he also will press upon their heel.

|  [49:20] Asher, his food is rich,
|  and he provides royal dainties.

|  [49:21] Naphtali, he is a flourishing terebinth,
|  that sends forth beautiful branches.

|  [49:22] Joseph, he is a fruitful branch,
|  a fruitful branch by a spring,
|  his tendrils run over the wall.
|  [49:23] They bitterly attack, they shoot at him.
|  The archers hatefully assail him,
|  [49:24] But his bow remains ever bent,
|  his forearms tireless,
|  through the power of the Mighty One of Jacob,
|  In the name of the Shepherd of Israel,
|  [49:25] the God of your fathers, who will help you,
|  and God Almighty, who blesses you,
|  with blessings of heaven above,
|  and of the great deep that lies beneath.
|  With blessings of the breast and womb,
|  [49:26] with blessings of your father,
|  with blessings of the everlasting mountains,
|  with the gifts of the ancient hills!
|  They will be on the head of Joseph,
|  on the head of the consecrated among his brothers.

|  [49:27] Benjamin is a ravening wolf.
|  In the morning he devours prey.

[49:28] These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them and blessed them; each accordingto his blessing he blessed them.[49:29] He instructed them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,[49:30] in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for the purpose of holding it as a burying-place.[49:31] There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.[49:32] The field and the cave that is in it which was purchased from the children of Heth.”[49:33] When Jacob had finished giving these instructions to his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his ancestors.

 [Genesis 50] 

[50:1] Joseph fell upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him.

[50:2] Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Jacob;[50:3] and forty days were devoted to it, for this is the full period for embalming.[50:4] The Egyptians also mourned for him seventy days.

[50:5] When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the members of Pharaoh’s court, saying, “If now you wish to do me a favor, speak to Pharaoh and say, Joseph’s father made him take an oath, saying, ‘See, I am dying; bury me in my grave which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Ask Pharaoh, ‘Let me go up, I beg of you, and bury my father; after that I will return.’”[50:6] Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you take an oath.”

[50:7] So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, all the elders of the land of Egypt,[50:8] all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their little ones, their sheep, and their cattle they left in the land of Goshen.[50:9] There went up with him both chariots and horsemen, so that it was a very great company.

[50:10] When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, they held there a great and impressive lamentation; and Joseph appointed a period of mourning for his father which lasted seven days.[50:11] When the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is an impressive mourning among the Egyptians.” That is why that place across the Jordan is called, Ebel-Mizraim^[ Mourning of the Egyptians].

[50:12] Then Jacob’s sons did for him what he had commanded them:[50:13] they carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to hold as a place of burial.[50:14] After he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father returned to Egypt.

[50:15] When Joseph’s brothers realized that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will now hate us and fully punish us for all the evil which we did to him!”[50:16] They sent this message to him: “Your father commanded before he died,[50:17] ‘Tell Joseph: Forgive, I beg of you, the wrongdoing and sin of your brothers, for they treated you basely.’ So now we beg of you forgive the wrongdoing of the servants of your father’s God.”

While they were speaking to him, Joseph began to weep,[50:18] his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, “See, we are your slaves.”[50:19] But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid; for am I in the place of God?[50:20] You plotted mischief against me, but God intended it for good, in order to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of the lives of many people.[50:21] Now therefore do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.” He said this kindly, comforting them.

[50:22] Joseph remained in Egypt with his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years,[50:23] and he saw Ephraim’s great-grandchildren; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were borne upon Joseph’s knees.

[50:24] Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely remember you and bring you up from this land to the land which he promised by an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”[50:25] Joseph required an oath of the children of Israel, saying, “When God remembers you, as he surely will, then you must carry up my bones from here.”[50:26] So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.


The Book of Joshua 
===================

 [Joshua 1] 

[1:1] Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,[1:2] ’Moses my servant is dead; now arise, go over this Jordan with all this people to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites.[1:3] Every place upon which the sole of thy foot shall tread, to thee will I give it, as I promised Moses.[1:4] From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting sun shall be your boundary.[1:5] No one shall be able to stand against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.[1:6] Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt bring this people into possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.[1:7] Only be very courageous and strong, to observe faithfully all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have success wherever thou goest.[1:8] This law-book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest observe faithfully all that is written in it; for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and shalt have success.[1:9] Have I not commanded thee? Be courageous and strong! Fear not, neither be dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou goest.’[1:10] Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying,[1:11] Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, ’Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as a possession.’[1:12] Also to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,[1:13] Remember the command which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, when he said, ’Jehovah your God is about to bring you to a settled abode and will give you this land.’[1:14] Your wives and your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you; but you – as many of you as are able to fight – shall pass over armed before your kinsmen and shall help them,[1:15] until Jehovah hath given a settled abode to your kinsmen as to you and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is about to give them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the rising sun.[1:16] And they answered Joshua saying. All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.[1:17] As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses.[1:18] Any one who shall rebel against your command and shall not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be courageous and strong.

 [Joshua 2] 

[2:1] Then Joshua the son of Nun sent secretly from Shittim two men as spies, saying. Go view the land and especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there.[2:2] Now it was told the king of Jericho, saying, There came some men here tonight from the Israelites to explore the land.[2:3] And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying. Bring forth the men who have come to you, for they have come to explore all the land.[2:4] Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said. It is true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.[2:5] When the time came to shut the gate at nightfall.[2:6] She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof.[2:7] Accordingly the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan opposite the fords, and as soon as they that pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.[2:8] But before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof,[2:9] and said to the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that terror because of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are losing heart before you.[2:10] For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.[2:11] And as soon as we had heard it, we lost heart completely, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah yonr God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth beneath.[2:12] Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you will also deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token.[2:13] But Rahab said to the men. Swear that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.[2:14] And the men said to her, We will be prepared to forfeit our lives for you, if you do not disclose this business of ours. It shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.[2:15] Then she let them down by a rope through the window (for her house was so close beside the city wall that she dwelt upon the wall).[2:16] And she said to them. Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers happen to find you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go on your way.[2:17] Then the men said to her. We will be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear.[2:18] Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down and you shall gather to yourself into the house, your father and your mother and your brothers, and all your father’s household.[2:19] And it shall be, if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if any one stays with you in the house, his blood shall be on our heads, if an injury befalls him.[2:20] But if you do disclose this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath to which you have made us swear.[2:21] And she said. Let it be as you say. So she sent them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.[2:22] So they went and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned. Now the pursuers sought for them in every direction, but did not find them.[2:23] Then the two men returned, descending from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them.[2:24] And they said to Joshua, Jehovah hath delivered all the land into our power; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land have lost heart before us.

 [Joshua 3] 

[3:1] Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and he and all the Israelites came t the Jodan and spent the night there before they moved over. Then they removed from Shittim.[3:2] Now after three days the officers went through the midst of the camp[3:3] and commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God and the priest, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it.[3:4] Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have never passed this way before.[3:5] And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you.[3:6] And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.[3:7] Then Jehovah said to Joshus, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that I will be with thee as I was with Moses,[3:8] and thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, you shall stand still in the waters of Jordan.[3:9] Joshua also said to the Israelites, Come hither and hear the words of Jehovah your God.[3:10] Then Joshua said, By this you shall know that a living God is among you, and that he will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites and the Jebusites.[3:11] Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.[3:12] Also take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.[3:13] And it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, and they shall rise in a heap. And the waters that come down from above shall stand still.[3:14] And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant being before the people, that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan.[3:15] And so when those who were crossing carrying the ark came to the Jordan – the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest – therefore when the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water,[3:16] the waters which came down from above stood still. Its waters rose up in a heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people stood opposite Jericho.[3:17] And the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan.

 [Joshua 4] 

[4:1] And it came to pass, when the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan, that Jehovah said to Joshua,[4:2] take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.[4:3] Command them saying, Take hence from the midst of the Jordan, (out of the place where the priests’ feet stood) twelve stones, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the camping-place, where you shall pass the night,[4:4] Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed of the Israelites, a man from each tribe,[4:5] and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and let every man of you lift a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites;[4:6] that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do you mean by these stones?"[4:7] then you shall say to them, "Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off." and these stones shall be for a memorial to the Israelites forever.[4:8] And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.[4:9] Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.[4:10] The priests who carried the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. Then the people passed over quickly.[4:11] And it came to pass when all the people had finished the passage, that the ark of Jehovah passed over and the priests, in the presence of the people.[4:12] And the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses commanded them;[4:13] about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho.[4:14] On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.[4:15] And Jehovah said to Joshua,[4:16] Command the priests who carry the ark of the law, that they come up out of the Jordan.[4:17] Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.[4:18] And when the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up on the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before.[4:19] So the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.

 [Joshua 5 ] 

[5 :1] Now when all the kings of the Amorites, who were to the west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the Israelites, until they were passed over, they lost heart, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the Israelites.[5 :2] At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make knives of flint, and circumcise again the Israelites the second time.[5 :3] Then Joshua made him knives of flint and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeah Araloth (The hill of the foreskins).[5 :4] Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised the Israelites: all the people that came out of Egypt who were males, even all the men capable of fighting, died in the wilderness in the way, on the journey from Egypt.[5 :5] For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness in the way on the journey from Egypt, had not been circumcised.[5 :6] For the Israelites wandered forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men capable of fighting, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not heed the mice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land concerning which, Jehovah gave oath to their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey. [5 :7] But their children, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the journey. [5 :8] Then when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were well again.[5 :9] And Jehovah said to Joshua, To-day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. So the name of that place has been called Gilgal (Rolling), to this day.[5 :10] When now the Israelites encamped in Gilgal, they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the mouth in the evening in the plains of Jericho.[5 :11] And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, on the very same day.[5 :12] And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.[5 :13] Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And ,Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries? [5 :14] And he said, Nay, but as Prince of the host of Jehovah have I now come. Then Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What has my lord to say to his servant? [5 :15] And the Prince of Jehovah’s host said to Joshua, Take off thy sandals from thy feet; for the place on which thou art standing is holy.

 [Joshua 6] 

[6:1] Now Jericho had closed its gates and was closed on account of the Israelites; no one went out or in. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; and ye shall march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets. [6:2] Then Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy power Jericho, and its king, with the men capable of fighting. [6:3] And ye shall march around the city, all the warriors going about the city once. Thus shall ye do six days. [6:5] And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down of itself. And the seventh day the people shall go up every man straight before him. [6:6] Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah, [6:7] therefore Joshua said to the people, March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah, [6:8] and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before, Jehovah shall pass on, while they blow the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following them, [6:9] and the armed men going before the priests who blow the trumpets, and the great multitude following the ark, while they continually blow the trumpets. [6:10] Joshua also commanded the people saying, You shall not shout the battle-cry, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word go out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ’Shout the battle-cry;’ then you shall shout. [6:11] So he caused the ark of Jehovah to march around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. [6:12] And Joshua rose early in the morning, so the priests took up the ark of Jehovah. [6:13] And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah kept going while they blew the trumpets, the armed men going before them and the rearguard following the ark of Jehovah, blowing trumpets [6:14] and the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days. [6:15] And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and when they had made the circuit of the city after the same manner, seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times. [6:16] And it came to pass at the seventh time, that the priests blew the trumpets; Joshua said to the people, Shout the battle-cry; for Jehovah bath given you the city. [6:17] And the city shall be completely devoted to Jehovah, together with all that is in it; only Rahab the harlot shall live, both she and those who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. [6:18] Only keep yourselves from that which has been placed under the ban, lest when you have placed it under the ban you take of it, and so bring the camp of Israel under the ban, and trouble it. [6:19] But all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron are holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah. [6:20] So the people shouted the battle-cry, and went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. And when they blew the trumpets, it came to pass, as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down of itself . [6:21] Then they completely destroyed by the sword all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass. [6:22] Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out from there the woman all that she has, as you took oath to her. [6:23] So the young men, the spies. went in and brought Rahab with her father and mother and kinsmen and all that she had. Even all the members of her family they brought out; and they put them in a place of security outside of the camp of Israel. [6:24] But they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah. [6:25] But Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all that she had, Joshua saved; and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel even until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. [6:26] At that time Joshua made them subscribe to this oath: Cursed be that man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city: With the loss of his first-born shall he lay its foundation, And with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates. [6:27] So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land. 

 [Joshua 7] 

[7:1] But the Israelites broke faith in that which had been placed under the ban; for Achan, the son of Carmi. the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which had been placed under the ban; therefore the anger of Jehovah was aroused against the Israelites.[7:2] And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is on the east side of  Bethel, and commanded them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went and spied out Ai. [7:3] And when they returned to Joshua, they said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people toil up there; for they are few.[7:4] So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; but they fled before the men of Ai. [7:5] And the men of Ai smote of them, about thirty-six men. and pursued them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the people lost heart to resist and became as weak as water. [7:6] Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before Jehovah until the evening, together with the elders of Israel; and they put  dust upon their heads. [7:7] And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to bring ns to ruin! would that we had been contented and stayed beyond the Jordan! [7:8] O Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel bas turned his back before his enemies! [7:9] For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?[7:10] Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Arise! why art thou lying prostrate thus?[7:11] Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them, indeed they have actually taken that which was placed under the ban, and have also been guilty of theft and deception; and they have even put it among their own things. [7:12] That is ·why the Israelites cannot stand before their enemies, because they have fa11en under the ban. I will not be with you any more, unless ye destroy from among you that which was placed under the ban. [7:13] Arise, sanctify the people, and say, ’Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, "There is in the midst of thee, O Israel, that which was placed under the ban; thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away from among you that which was placed under the ban."[7:14] In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes; and it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take, shall come near man by man.[7:15] And it shall be that he who is taken that which was placed under the ban shall he burnt with fire, together with all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because be has committed a shameful crime in Israel.’ So ,Joshua ’rose up early in the morning. and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.[7:17] Then he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites, and he brought near the family of the Zerahites, man by man; and Zabdi was taken. [7:18] Then he brought near his household, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zcrah, of the tribe of Judah was taken. [7:19] Then Joshua said to Achan, my son, give, now, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and render praise to him; and tell now what you have done: do not conceal it from me. [7:20] And Achan answered Joshua and said, Truly, I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: [7:21] when I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver. and a bar of gold of fifty shekels weight, I coveted them and took them, and now they are hidden in the earth in the middle of my tent with the money underneath.[7:22] So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent. and there it was hidden in his tent with the money underneath. [7:23] And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and all the Israelites and laid  them down before Jehovah.[7:24] Then .Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan  the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep, and his tent and all that he had and brought them to the valley of Achor. [7:25] And Joshua said, Why have you brought trouble upon us? Jehovah shall bring trouble upon you today. So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones, [7:26] and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Hence the name of the place has been called the valley of Achor (Trouble) to this day.

Ruth

 [Ruth 1] 

##### Naomi and Ruth #####

[1:1] In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.[1:2] His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,[1:3] Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,[1:4] who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,[1:5] Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.

[1:6] So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the LORD  had remembered his people and given them food.[1:7] As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,[1:8] Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the LORD  be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.[1:9] The LORD  grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.”

Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud[1:10] and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”[1:11] But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?[1:12] Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,[1:13] would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the LORD  has sent me adversity.”[1:14] Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.

[1:15] “Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!”[1:16] But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;[1:17] I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the LORD  bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.”[1:18] When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.

[1:19] So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?”

[1:20] “Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara^[ 1:20 In Hebrew “Naomi” means “pleasant,” and “Mara” means “bitter.”], for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.[1:21] I had plenty when I left, but the LORD  has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the LORD  has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?”[1:22] So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

 [Ruth 2] 

##### In the Fields of Boaz #####

[2:1] Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.[2:2] Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.”

“Go, my daughter,” she replied.

[2:3] So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.[2:4] When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The LORD  be with you,” they answered him, “May the LORD  bless you.”

[2:5] “Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.[2:6] The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.[2:7] She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.”

[2:8] Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.[2:9] Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.”

[2:10] Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?”[2:11] Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.[2:12] May the LORD  repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”[2:13] Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.”

[2:14] At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.[2:15] When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.[2:16] Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.”

[2:17] So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.[2:18] Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.

[2:19] “Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!”

So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man with whom I worked today,” she said, “is Boaz.”

[2:20] Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the LORD  rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.”

[2:21] “He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.”

[2:22] Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.”[2:23] So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.

 [Ruth 3] 

##### Night and morning #####

[3:1] One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?[3:2] Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?[3:3] Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.[3:4] Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.”

[3:5] “I will do as you say.” Ruth said to her.

[3:6] So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.[3:7] When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.[3:8] At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet![3:9] “Who are you?” he said. “I am Ruth your servant,” she answered, “Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.”[3:10] He said, “May you be blest by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.[3:11] My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.[3:12] Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.[3:13] Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the LORD  lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.”

[3:14] So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognize her, for Boaz said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.”[3:15] He also said, “Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.” So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.

[3:16] When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “Is it you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.[3:17] “He gave me these six measures of barley,” she said, “for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.”

[3:18] “Wait quietly, my daughter.” Naomi said, “Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.”

 [Ruth 4] 

[4:1] Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, “Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.” So he stopped and sat down.[4:2] Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.

[4:3] Then he said to the near relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,[4:4] and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.”

“I will buy it,” he said.

[4:5] Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.”

[4:6] “I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,” the near relative said. “You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.”

[4:7] Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.[4:8] So when the near relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.

[4:9] Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.[4:10] Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.”

[4:11] Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD  make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.[4:12] From the children whom the LORD  will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”

[4:13] So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the LORD  gave to her a son.[4:14] Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD  who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.[4:15] This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!”

[4:16] So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.[4:17] The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.

The First Book of Samuel
========================

 [1 Samuel 1] 

### Samuel ###

##### Samuel’s Birth #####

[1:1] Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.[1:2] He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.[1:3] This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD  of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD  there.[1:4] It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters,[1:5] but to Hannah he used to give a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD  had shut up her womb.[1:6] Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the LORD  had shut up her womb.[1:7] This happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat.[1:8] But Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?”

[1:9] So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh, and stood before the LORD . Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the LORD .[1:10] She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the LORD  and wept bitterly.[1:11] She vowed a vow, saying,

|  “O LORD  of armies!
|  If you will indeed look on the affliction of your maid-servant,
|  remember me and not forget your maid-servant,
|  but will give to your maid-servant a boy
|  then I will give him to the LORD  all the days of his life.
|  A razor will not come upon his head.”

[1:12] While she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.[1:13] Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman.[1:14] So Eli said to her, “How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the LORD .”

[1:15] “No, my lord,” Hannah answered, “I am an unfortunate woman! I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my heart before the LORD .[1:16] Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.”

[1:17] Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.”

[1:18] She said, “Let your maid-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.

[1:19] They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD  remembered her.

[1:20] And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and named him Samuel^[ 1:20 Heb: Asked of God], saying, “For I have asked him of the LORD .”

[1:21] The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD  the yearly sacrifice and his vow.[1:22] But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he will appear in the presence of the LORD  and will live there forever.”

[1:23] Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD  establish your word.”

So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him.[1:24] When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD  in Shiloh.[1:25] They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli.[1:26] She said, “Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the LORD .[1:27] This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the LORD  has granted me my petition which I asked of him.[1:28] Now, I on my part have given him to the LORD ; as long as he lives he is given to the LORD .” So she left him there before the LORD .

 [1 Samuel 2] 

[2:1] And Hannah prayed:

|  My heart exults in the LORD,
|  my strength is exalted in the LORD ;
|  my mouth laughs at my enemies;
|  because I rejoice in your salvation.

|  [2:2] There is none holy as the LORD,
|  there is none like you;
|  there is no rock like our God.

|  [2:3] Do not talk so proudly,
|  let not arrogance come out of your mouth,
|  for the LORD  is a God of knowledge,
|  and by him actions are weighed.

|  [2:4] The bows of the mighty men are broken,
|  and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
|  [2:5] They that were full have hired out themselves for bread,
|  and they that were hungry have ceased;
|  while the barren has borne seven,
|  she who had many children has languished.

|  [2:6] The LORD  kills, and makes alive;
|  he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
|  [2:7] The LORD  makes poor, and makes rich;
|  he brings low, he also lifts up.
|  [2:8] He raises up the poor out of the dust,
|  he lifts up the needy from the garbage heap
|  to make them sit with princes,
|  and inherit the throne of glory.
|  For the pillars of the earth are the LORD ’S,
|  and he has set the world upon them.

|  [2:9] He will guard the feet of his holy ones,
|  but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness;
|  for not by strength will humans prevail.
|  [2:10] They who strive with the LORD  will be broken to pieces;
|  against them will he thunder in heaven.
|  The LORD  will judge the ends of the earth,
|  he will give strength to his king
|  and exalt the power of his anointed.

[2:11] So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the LORD  in the presence of Eli the priest.[2:12] Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the LORD,[2:13] nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,[2:14] and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the LORD  in Shiloh.[2:15] Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, “Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.”[2:16] Should the man, however, say to him, “First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,” he would reply, “No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.”[2:17] The sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men had contempt for the offering of the LORD .[2:18] And Samuel continued ministering before the LORD  – a lad girded with a linen ephod.[2:19] His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.[2:20] And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “The LORD  repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the LORD .” Then they would return to their own home.[2:21] And the LORD  visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew up before the LORD .

[2:22] Now Eli was very old; and whenver he heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting,[2:23] he said to them, “Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people.[2:24] No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD  spreading abroad.[2:25] If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who could act as mediator for him?” Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the LORD  desired to slay them.[2:26] But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of the LORD  and of men.

[2:27] There came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “This is the LORD ’s message: I revealed myself to your father’s house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh’s house,[2:28] and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to your father’s house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.[2:29] Why do you look with envious eyes on my sacrifices and offerings, and honor your sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?’[2:30] Therefore the LORD  the God of Israel says, ‘I had indeed thought that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever,’ but now the LORD  says, ‘Far be it from me, for them who honor me I will honor, and they who despise me will be lightly esteemed.[2:31] The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house.[2:32] You will look in affliction and enviously on all the prosperity which I will give Israel, and there will not be an old man in your house forever.[2:33] The only one of you whom I do not cut off from my altar will be spared to weep out his eyes and to wear out his body, and all of your household will die by the sword of men.[2:34] This will be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both will die.[2:35] And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire, and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before my anointed forever.[2:36] Anyone who is left in your house will come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and will beg to be given in one of the priests’ offices so that they may eat a morsel of bread.’”

 [1 Samuel 3] 

[3:1] The child Samuel continued ministering before the LORD  in the presence of Eli. The word of the LORD  was rare in those days; there were no frequent visions.[3:2] Once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel place – his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see –[3:3] and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the LORD  where the ark of God was,[3:4] the LORD  called, “Samuel! Samuel!” He said, “Here I am.”[3:5] He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he said, “I didn’t call, lie down again.” So he went and lay down.[3:6] Then the LORD  called yet again, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”[3:7] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD  neither had the word of the LORD  yet been revealed to him.[3:8] So when the LORD  called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” Then Eli realized that the LORD  was calling the child.[3:9] So Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.”’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place.[3:10] Then the LORD  came, and stood there, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant is listening.”[3:11] And the LORD  said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the ears of everyone who hears it will ring.[3:12] In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end.[3:13] For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them.[3:14] Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli’s house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.”

[3:15] And Samuel lay there until the morning. Then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the LORD . Samuel was afraid to make the known the vision to Eli.[3:16] But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “I am here.”[3:17] He said, “What is the thing that the LORD  has spoken to you? Hide nothing from me. May God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you.”[3:18] So Samuel told him everything; and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the LORD ; let him do what seems good to him.”

[3:19] And Samuel grew, and the LORD  was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.[3:20] All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD .[3:21] And the LORD  again appeared in Shiloh, for the LORD  revealed himself to Samuel,

 [1 Samuel 4] 

[4:1] and the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

##### Samuel the judge #####

Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.[4:2] The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men.[4:3] But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD  smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”[4:4] So they sent to Shiloh; and took from there the ark of the LORD  of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God.[4:5] When the ark of God the LORD  came to the camp, all Israel shouted such a great shout that the earth rang.

[4:6] When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does this great shouting in the Hebrew’s camp mean?” When they learned that the ark of the LORD  had come to the camp,[4:7] they were afraid, and said, “These are their gods. They have come to them to the camp.[4:8] Woe to Woe to us! Nothin like this has happened to us before! Who can deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague and pesilence.[4:9] Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, so that you will not become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.”

[4:10] So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and each fled to his home. There fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.[4:11] The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished.

[4:12] A Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head.[4:13] Just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out.[4:14] When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, “What is this tumultuous noise?” The man came quickly and told Eli.[4:15] (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see).[4:16] The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle, for I fled today from the ranks.” He said, “How went the matter, my son?”[4:17] He that brought the tidings answered, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”[4:18] When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.

[4:19] His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and near her time. When she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and crouched down and gave birth to a child.[4:20] As she lay dying, the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she neither answered nor heeded.[4:21] She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory is taken away from Israel,” meaning the capture of the ark of God, and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.[4:22] “Glory has left Israel,” she said, “because the ark of God is taken.”

 [1 Samuel 5] 

[5:1] The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.[5:2] Then the Philistines took the ark of the LORD  and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon.[5:3] When the Ashdodites arose early the next day, there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD . They raised up Dagon and set him in his place again.[5:4] But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD . The head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left.[5:5] This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but step over it.[5:6] The hand of the LORD  was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its borders.[5:7] When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”[5:8] So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.[5:9] But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the LORD  was against the city – there was a very great panic – and he struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tomors broke out on them.[5:10] So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.”[5:11] They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, let it go back to its own place and not kill us and our people.” For a deadly panic had seized the entire city. The hand of God was very heavy there.[5:12] The men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven.

 [1 Samuel 6] 

[6:1] The ark of the LORD  was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.[6:2] Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the LORD ? Show us how we should send it to its place.”[6:3] They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty. You must return to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you.”[6:4] Then they were asked, “What should the guilt offering be which we should return to him?” and they said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden rats, corresponding to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your lords.[6:5] Therefore you should make images of your tumors, and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you should give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from on you and your gods and your land.[6:6] Why be stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh were stubborn? Remember how he made sport of them until they let Israel go?

[6:7] So take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows which have never been yoked, and fasten the cows to the cart. But leave their calves behind them at home.[6:8] Take the ark of the LORD  and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a guilt offering in a box at its side. Then send it on its way.[6:9] Watch; if it goes on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it was the LORD  was did us this great harm, but if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that stuck us but it was an accident that happened to us.”

[6:10] The men did all this. They took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.[6:11] They placed the ark of the LORD  on the cart, and the box with the golden rats and the images of their tumors.[6:12] The cows took a straight course in the direction of Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn left nor right. The lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.[6:13] The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. They lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it.[6:14] When the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, it stood still there, near a great stone. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD .[6:15] The Levites took down the ark of the LORD  and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered to the LORD  on that day burnt offerings and ordinary sacrifices.[6:16] When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day.

[6:17] These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD : one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.[6:18] The golden rats correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. A witness is the great stone, by which they set down the ark of the LORD . To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.

[6:19] The descendents of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Beth-shemesh, when they welcomed the ark of the LORD . So he killed seventy of them, and the people mourned because the LORD  had struck the people with such a great slaughter.[6:20] The people of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? To whom can we send him to be rid of him?”[6:21] So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD . Come and take it back with you.”

 [1 Samuel 7] 

[7:1] So the people of Kiriath-jearim came, and took the ark of the LORD, and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the LORD .

[7:2] Many years passed from the time the ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim – twenty years. All the nation of Israel turned to the LORD,[7:3] and Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are returning to the LORD, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you and direct your hearts towards the LORD  and serve him alone, so that he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”[7:4] So the Israelites put away the Baals and the Astartes, and served the LORD  only.[7:5] Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with the LORD .”[7:6] So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted all day and confessed, “We have sinned against the LORD .” And Samuel judged the Israelites in Mizpah.

[7:7] When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines[7:8] and said to Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to the LORD  our God for us, so that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines.”[7:9] Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD, and cried to the LORD  on behalf of Israel, and the LORD  answered him.[7:10] While Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. But the LORD  thundered with a mighty voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.[7:11] The men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them until they were below Beth-car.

[7:12] Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer, saying, “This is how far the LORD  has helped us.”[7:13] So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of the LORD  was against the Philistines as long as Samuel lived.[7:14] The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel recovered their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

[7:15] Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.[7:16] He used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he used to judge Israel in all those places.[7:17] But he always returned to Ramah, for there was his home, and there he judged Israel. There he built an altar to the LORD .

 [1 Samuel 8] 

### Samuel and Saul ###

##### Development of Monarchy #####

[8:1] When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons judges over Israel.[8:2] The eldest was called Joel, and his second was called Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba.[8:3] However his sons did not follow his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice.[8:4] So all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah,[8:5] and they said to him, “You have become old and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint for us a king to rule us like all the other nations.”[8:6] But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD .[8:7] The LORD  said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people and all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.[8:8] Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to you.[8:9] Listen to what they have to say, but solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who will reign over them.”

[8:10] Samuel told all the words of the LORD  to the people who were asking him to appoint a king.[8:11] He said, “This will be the way of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and cavalry. They will run before his chariots,[8:12] and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the equipment for his chariots.[8:13] He will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers.[8:14] Of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants.[8:15] He will take a tenth of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants.[8:16] He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and your donkeys, and use them for his work.[8:17] He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his slaves.[8:18] Then you will cry out in that day against your king whom you chose for yourselves, but the LORD  will not answer you in that day.”[8:19] But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, “No, we must have a king over us,[8:20] so that we will like all other the nations, and so that our king can rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.”[8:21] And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the LORD .[8:22] And the LORD  said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and make them a king.” And Samuel said to the people of Israel, “Each of your return to your city.”

 [1 Samuel 9] 

[9:1] Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth.[9:2] He had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was. He was a head taller than any of the people.

[9:3] Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had strayed. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the servants with you and go out and find the donkeys.”[9:4] They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. They passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them.

[9:5] When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, or my father will stop thinking of the donkeys and become anxious for us.”[9:6] But the servant answered, “There is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honor. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now, and perhaps he can give us information about the mission on which we are going.”[9:7] Saul said to the boy, “But, suppose we go, what should we take to the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What do we have?”[9:8] The servant answered Saul again, “See I have with me a quarter shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God so that he may give us information regarding our mission.”[9:9] (Formerly in Israel, when someone went to inquire of God, they said, “Come let us go to the seer;” because what is nowadays called a prophet was previously called a seer).[9:10] Then Saul said to his servant, “Your advice is good. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.

[9:11] As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met some young girls going out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?”[9:12] They answered, “Yes, he is there ahead of you. Hurry, he has come today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.[9:13] As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he is needed to bless the sacrifice before the guests eat. Now go up, and at this time you will meet him.”[9:14] So they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place.

[9:15] Now the LORD  had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation:[9:16] “At this time tomorrow I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin and you must anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, because I have seen the suffering of my people, and their cry has reached me.”[9:17] When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD  indicated to him, “This is the man of whom I spoke to you! He is the one who will rule over my people.”[9:18] Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is.”[9:19] And Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you will eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.[9:20] As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them. They have been found. To whom does all that is desirable in Israel belong? Does it not belong to you, and to your ancestral house?[9:21] Saul answered, “But I am a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin! Why do you speak like this to me?”

[9:22] Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons).[9:23] And he said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside.”[9:24] The cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, “See, the meat is served! Eat! It was kept for you until the appointed time, so that you might eat with those whom I have invited.”

So Saul ate with Samuel that day.[9:25] After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down for the night.[9:26] At daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, so that I can send you on your way.” So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street.

[9:27] As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell your servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay here so that I can make known to you the word of God.”

 [1 Samuel 10] 

[10:1] Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “The LORD  has anointed you to be a ruler over his people Israel. You will reign over the people of the LORD  and save them from the power of their enemies all around. This will be the sign that the LORD  has anointed you to be a ruler over his heritage:[10:2] when you go from me today you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the donkeys and is anxious for you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’[10:3] Then you will go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor. There three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.[10:4] They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you will take from their hand.[10:5] After that you will come to Gibeah-elohim, where the garrison of the Philistines is. When you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them, and they will be prophesying.[10:6] The spirit of the LORD  will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.[10:7] When these signs come to you, you will do as the occasion offers, for God is with you.[10:8] You must go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.”

[10:9] As Saul turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him a change of heart, and all those signs came to pass that day.[10:10] On his way to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the spirit of God possessed him, and he prophesied among them.[10:11] When everyone who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”[10:12] One of the bystanders answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”[10:13] When he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.[10:14] Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” He said, “To find the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel.”[10:15] And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”[10:16] And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us that the donkeys were found.” But about the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing.

[10:17] Samuel called the people together to Mizpah,[10:18] and said to the Israelites, “This is what the LORD  the God of Israel says: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.[10:19] But today you rejected your God, who has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No! You must set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD  by your tribes and by your clans.”

[10:20] So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was picked by lot.[10:21] He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their clans, and the clan of the Matrites was picked by lot. He brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was picked, but when they searched for him, him he could not be found.[10:22] So they asked of the LORD  further, “Did the man come here?” And the LORD  answered “See, he has hid himself among the baggage.”[10:23] Someone ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people by a head.[10:24] Said Samuel to the people, “Have you seen this man whom the LORD  has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people.” All the people shouted loudly, “Long live the king!”

[10:25] In this way Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD . Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to their home.[10:26] And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and with him went the warriors whose hearts God had touched.[10:27] But there were some scoundrels who said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no presents.

 [1 Samuel 11] 

##### Saul the king #####

[11:1] About a month later Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make terms with us and we will serve you.”[11:2] But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition will I make terms with you: that I gouge out the right eye of each of you and by this bring disgrace on all Israel.”[11:3] The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days respite, so that we can send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be no one to save us we will surrender to you.”[11:4] So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud.

[11:5] Saul was just coming from the field, driving the oxen. He said, “What is the trouble with the people? Why are they weeping?” Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.[11:6] The spirit of the LORD  rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused.[11:7] He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen!” Then a terror from the LORD  fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man.

[11:8] He mustered them in Bezek. The Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.[11:9] They said to the messengers who came, “Say this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance will have come to you.” So the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh. They rejoiced,[11:10] and said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you please.”[11:11] On the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions. They came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and massacred the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. The survivors scattered, so that no two of them were left together.

[11:12] The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Saul will not reign over us?’ Bring the men that we may put them to death!”[11:13] But Saul said, “Today no one will be put to death, because today the LORD  has brought deliverance to Israel.”

[11:14] Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.”[11:15] All the people went to Gilgal. There they made Saul king before the LORD  in Gilgal, and sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel held a great celebration.

 [1 Samuel 12] 

[12:1] Samuel said to all Israel, “See, I have listened to you in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you.[12:2] From now on, behold the king who will lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth to this day.[12:3] Here I am! Testify against me before the LORD, and before his annointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I oppressed? Whom have I defrauded? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to turn a blind eye? Testify and I will restore it to you.”[12:4] They said, “You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.”[12:5] So he said to them, “The LORD  is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” They said, “He is witness.”

[12:6] Then Samuel said to the people, “The LORD  is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt.[12:7] Now therefore take your stand so that I may declare to you before the LORD  all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your ancestors.[12:8] When Jacob came to Egypt, and your ancestors cried to the LORD, then the LORD  sent Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors out of Egypt, and settled them in this place.[12:9] But they forgot the LORD  their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of King Jabin of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab. They fought against them,[12:10] and cried to the LORD  and said, “We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD  and served the Baals and the Astartes. Deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.”[12:11] And the LORD  sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samson, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies surrounding you so that you lived in safety.[12:12] But when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king must reign over us,’ although the LORD  your God was your king.[12:13] Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for the LORD  has now set a king over you.[12:14] If you will fear the LORD  and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD  your God, then it will be well.[12:15] But if you will not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then will the hand of the LORD  be against you and your king.[12:16] Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing that the LORD  is about to do before your eyes.[12:17] Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD  to send thunder and rain. You will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD  in asking for a king.”[12:18] So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD  sent thunder and rain that day. All the people were greatly afraid of the LORD  and Samuel.

[12:19] Then all the people said to Samuel, “Intercede with the LORD  your God in behalf of your servants so that we do not die, because we have added to all our sins the crime of asking for a king.”[12:20] But Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, you have indeed done all this evil, but do not turn aside from following the LORD . Serve the LORD  with all your heart,[12:21] and do not turn aside after useless things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are useless.[12:22] For the LORD  because of his great name will not cast away his people, for the LORD  has undertaken to make you his own people.[12:23] Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD  in ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.[12:24] Only fear the LORD  and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see the great things he has done for you.[12:25] But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king will be swept away.

 [1 Samuel 13] 

[13:1] Saul was … years old when he began to reign, and he reigned … and two years over Israel.^[ 13:1 The numbers are missing from the text.]

[13:2] Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent to their homes.[13:3] Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the news reached the Philistines that the Hebrews were in revolt. But Saul had in the meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land,[13:4] and all Israel heard the news that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. The people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.

[13:5] The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel – thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and fighters as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.[13:6] When the Israelites saw that they were in a strait (for the fighters were hard pressed), they hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.[13:7] Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.

[13:8] He waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him.[13:9] So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.” He offered the burnt-offering.[13:10] Just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Samuel came, and Saul went out to greet him.[13:11] Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash,[13:12] I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down to me at Gilgal, and I will not have appeased the LORD .’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt-offering.”[13:13] Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of the LORD  your God, which he commanded you, then would the LORD  have established your kingdom over Israel forever.[13:14] But now your kingdom will not continue. The LORD  has sought out a man after his own heart, and the LORD  has appointed him a leader over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD  commanded you.”[13:15] Then Samuel arose and left Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul, going from Gilgal towards Gibeah of Benjamin.

Saul counted the people who were with him, about six hundred men.[13:16] Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash.[13:17] Raiding parties came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual,[13:18] and another division turned in the direction of Beth-horon, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

[13:19] Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “The Hebrews must not make swords or spears,”[13:20] so all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his sickle and his ax and his mattock.[13:21] The charge was two thirds of a shekel for ploughshares and mattocks, and one third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and setting the ox goads.[13:22] So on the day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.

[13:23] A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash,

 [1 Samuel 14] 

[14:1] and one day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come – let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.[14:2] Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree at Mignon, and with him were about six hundred men.[14:3] Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD  at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone.[14:4] Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.[14:5] One crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.

[14:6] Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the LORD  will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent the LORD  from saving by many or by few.”[14:7] His armor-bearer said to him, “Do whatever your judgement dictates. I am with you, your wish is mine.”[14:8] Then Jonathan said, “We will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them.[14:9] If they say to us, ‘Stand still until we can reach you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.[14:10] But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for the LORD  has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign to us.”[14:11] When both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”[14:12] The men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us so that we can tell you something.” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD  has given them into the hand of Israel.”[14:13] And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer kept despatching them after him.[14:14] In the first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer slew about twenty men in an area of about half an acre.[14:15] There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and even the raiders trembled and the earth quaked so that it produced a great panic.

[14:16] The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw the army surging hither and thither.[14:17] Saul said to the people who were with him, “Investigate now and see who is gone from us.” When they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.[14:18] And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here,” for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel.[14:19] While Saul was speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. So Saul said to the priest, “Draw back your hand.”[14:20] And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle, and every man’s sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion.[14:21] The Hebrews who had gone over to the Philistines and joined their the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.[14:22] Likewise all the Israelites who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, pursued close after them in the battle.[14:23] So the LORD  saved Israel that day, and the battle passed on beyond Beth-aven.

[14:24] Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.[14:25] Now there was honeycomb in that country,[14:26] and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.[14:27] But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people. He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened.[14:28] Then one of the fighters spoke up, “Your father charged the people saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’ So the men are exhausted.”[14:29] Then said Jonathan, “My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey.[14:30] If only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines!”

[14:31] But they struck at the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint,[14:32] and they rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood.[14:33] When Saul was told that the people were sinning against the LORD  in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, “Treason! Roll a great stone to me.”[14:34] And Saul said, “Go out among the people and say to them, ‘Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against the LORD  in eating the flesh together with the blood.’” All the people brought their oxen that night and slew them there.[14:35] So Saul built an altar to the LORD . That was the first altar that he built to the LORD .

[14:36] Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder among them until daybreak, and let us not spare a single man.” They said, “Do whatever you think best,” but the priest said, “Let us first consut God.”[14:37] So Saul asked of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But there was no answer that day.[14:38] And Saul said, “Come here, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt today.[14:39] For as the LORD  lives, who delivered Israel, even if it be in Jonathan my son, that man will surely die.” But no one of all the people answered him.[14:40] Then he said to all Israel, “You will on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”[14:41] Therefore Saul asked the LORD, God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant this day? If the guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, the LORD, God of Israel, give Urim, but if the guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And the lot indicated Jonathan and Saul, and the people were cleared.[14:42] And Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom the LORD  indicates, must die.” The people said to Saul, “It must not be so!” But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was indicated.

[14:43] Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, saying, “I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand, and here I am! I am ready to die.”[14:44] And Saul said, “May God do to me whatever he pleases, you must surely die, Jonathan!”[14:45] But the people said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD  lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die.[14:46] Then Saul broke off from pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own country.

[14:47] When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned he was victorious.[14:48] He did mighty deeds and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers.

[14:49] Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal.[14:50] The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son Saul’s uncle Ner.[14:51] Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.

[14:52] The war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would take him into his service.

 [1 Samuel 15] 

[15:1] Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD  sent me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now listen to the words of the LORD .[15:2] This says the LORD  of armies: ‘I have determined to punish the Amalekites for wha they did to Israel, in opposing them as they came up out of Egypt.[15:3] Now go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have. Spare no one but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”

[15:4] So Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah.[15:5] When Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley.[15:6] Saul said to the Kenites, “Go away, withdraw from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.[15:7] And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.[15:8] He took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword.[15:9] But Saul and his army spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fat beasts, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them. But everything that was worthless and despised they completely destroyed.

[15:10] Then the word of the LORD  came to Samuel saying,[15:11] “I repent of making Saul king, because he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands.” And Samuel was angry and cried to the LORD  all night.[15:12] Early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, “Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument to himself and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.”[15:13] When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “Blessed be you of the LORD ! I have fulfilled the command of the LORD .”[15:14] And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?”[15:15] And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best off the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD  your God, and the rest we have completely destroyed.”[15:16] Then Samuel said to “Saul, Stop! and let me tell you what the LORD  has said to me this night.” He said to him, “Speak.”

[15:17] Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD  anointed you king over Israel,[15:18] and the LORD  sent you on an expedition and said, ‘Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.’[15:19] Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD  and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease the LORD ?”[15:20] And Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the LORD  and have gone on the expedition which the LORD  sent me on and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.[15:21] But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban, to sacrifice to the LORD  your God in Gilgal.”[15:22] And Samuel said, “Does the LORD  delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of the LORD ? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.[15:23] For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you from being king.”[15:24] And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of the LORD  and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice.[15:25] Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship the LORD .”[15:26] But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD  and the LORD  has rejected you from being king over Israel.”[15:27] As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore.[15:28] Then Samuel said to him, “The LORD  has today torn the kingdom of Israel from you and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.[15:29] Moreover the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a mortal that he should change his mind.”[15:30] Then Saul said, “I have sinned, yet honor me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, so that I may worship the LORD  your God.”[15:31] So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped the LORD .

[15:32] Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him trembling and said, “Surely death is bitter.”[15:33] Samuel said, “As your sword has bereaved women, so will your mother be the most bereaved of women.” Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD  in Gilgal.

[15:34] Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.[15:35] And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now the LORD  repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

 [1 Samuel 16] 

### Saul, Jonathan, and David ###

##### David at the court of Saul #####

[16:1] The LORD  said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king among his sons.”[16:2] And Samuel said, “How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me?” But the LORD  said, “Take a calf with you and say you have come to sacrifice to the LORD .[16:3] Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do, and anoint the man whom I name.”[16:4] So Samuel did that which the LORD  had commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”[16:5] He said “Yes, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD . Purify yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sacrifice.” He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

[16:6] When they came and he saw Eliab, he said, “Surely the LORD ’s annointed is now in presence.”[16:7] But the LORD  said to Samuel, “Pay no attention to his appearance or to the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. The LORD  does not see as humans see, for they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD  looks at the heart.”[16:8] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, “Neither has the LORD  chosen this one.”[16:9] Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath the LORD  chosen this one.[16:10] Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD  has not chosen these.”[16:11] And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all your sons?” He said, “There is still the youngest, but he is a shepherd with the flock.” So Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here.”[16:12] So he sent and brought him in. Now he was handsome, a youth with beautiful eyes and ruddy cheeks. And the LORD  said, “Get up, anoint him, for this is the man.”[16:13] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The spirit of the LORD  came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.

[16:14] Now the spirit of the LORD  had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the LORD  tormented him.[16:15] And Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.[16:16] Command your servants who are before and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he will play with his hand, and you will be better.”[16:17] So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.”[16:18] One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a good fighter, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and the LORD  is with him.”[16:19] So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the flock.”[16:20] And Jesse took ten loaves of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul with David his son.[16:21] So David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul loved him so much that he became one of his armor-bearers,[16:22] and sent a message to Jesse, saying, “Let David enter my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”[16:23] Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him.

 [1 Samuel 17] 

[17:1] Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war. They were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.[17:2] Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle-array against the Philistines.[17:3] The Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them.[17:4] A champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath of Gath and he was over nine feet in height.[17:5] He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was clad with a bronze breastplate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds.[17:6] He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.[17:7] The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds. His shield-bearer went before him.[17:8] He stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul’s servants? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.[17:9] If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”[17:10] The Philistine said, “I have insulted the ranks of Israel today! Give me a man that we may fight together.”[17:11] When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid.

[17:12] Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. The man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.[17:13] The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war. Their names were Eliab, the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.[17:14] David was the youngest. The three eldest had followed Saul,[17:15] while David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.

[17:16] The Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand for forty days.[17:17] One day Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.[17:18] But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand and look after your brothers’ welfare and bring back some token of assurance from them.

[17:19] They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.”

[17:20] So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry.[17:21] Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army.[17:22] David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the welfare of his brothers.[17:23] Just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before, and David heard them.

[17:24] All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid.[17:25] “Have you seen this man who has come up?” they said, “Surely he has come up to insult Israel. Whoever kills him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter and will make his father’s house free in Israel.”[17:26] Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, “What should be done for the man who strikes that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God?”[17:27] The people answered him in the words just given, “This is what will be done to the man who kills him.”

[17:28] Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart. You have come down to see the battle.”[17:29] David said, “What have I done now? It was only a question.”[17:30] Turning away from him to another, he spoke as before, and the people answered him again as at the first time.

[17:31] When the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They took him and brought him before Saul.[17:32] David said to Saul, “Let not my lord’s courage fail him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”[17:33] Saul answered, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. You are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth.”[17:34] But David said to Saul, “Your servant was a shepherd with his father’s flock, and when a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock,[17:35] I would go out after him and kill him and rescue the lamb from his mouth. If he rose up against me, I would seize him by his jaw and slay him with a blow.[17:36] Your servant has killed both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God.[17:37] The LORD  who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD  be with you.”

[17:38] Saul clothed David with his armor, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail.[17:39] David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these because I am not used to them. And he took them off.[17:40] He took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.

[17:41] The Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him.[17:42] When the Philistine looked and saw David, he had nothing but disdain for him, because he was only a youth with ruddy cheeks, a young man of attractive appearance.[17:43] The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog that you come to me with a stick?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods,[17:44] and said, “Come to me so that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”[17:45] Then David answered the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD  of armies, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted.[17:46] Today the LORD  will deliver you into my hands, that I may strike you and cut off your head. I will this day give the dead of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel,[17:47] so that all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear does the LORD  save, for the battle is the LORD ’s and he will give you into our hand.”

[17:48] When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine.[17:49] David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth.

[17:50] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and struck down the Philistine, killing him, although there was no sword in David’s hand.[17:51] Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, drawing it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it.

When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.[17:52] The men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron.[17:53] When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp,[17:54] but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armor in his tent.

[17:55] When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this lad?” And Abner said, “As you live, O king, I cannot tell.”[17:56] The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is.”[17:57] When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand.[17:58] Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, my lad?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”

 [1 Samuel 18] 

[18:1] Now when David had finished speaking with Saul, the lives of Jonathan and David became bound together, and Jonathon loved him as his own life,[18:2] and so Saul took David that day and would not let him return to his father’s house.[18:3] Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own life.[18:4] He stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle.[18:5] And David went out. On every task which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul appointed him over the warriors. He was beloved alike by all the people and by the servants of Saul.

[18:6] At the return home of the army and David’s return from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals.[18:7] The women sang to each other as they danced, “Saul has slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands.”[18:8] It made Saul very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?”[18:9] And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward.

[18:10] The next day an evil spirit from God came powerfully on Saul, and he prophesied within his house. David played the lyre to him, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand,[18:11] and cast it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But twice David dodged it.

[18:12] Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD  was with him and had departed from Saul.[18:13] So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander over a thousand. David went out and came in at the head of his men,[18:14] and he acted wisely and prospered in all his ways, for the LORD  was with him.[18:15] When Saul saw that David acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him.[18:16] But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at the head of the army.

[18:17] Then Saul said to David, “See my oldest daughter, Merab. I will give her to you as wife, only be a valiant champion and fight the LORD ’s battles.” For Saul said to himself, “I must not raise my hand against him, but let the hand of the Philistines deal with him.”[18:18] And David replied to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my father’s clan in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?”[18:19] But when the time came that Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite.

[18:20] Michal, Saul’s daughter, fell in love with David. When they told Saul, he was pleased.[18:21] He thought, “I will give her to him, so that she becomes a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You will this day be my son-in-law.”[18:22] Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly and tell him that the king is pleased with him and all the servants love him, therefore become the king’s son-in-law.”[18:23] And Saul’s servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, “Is it an easy thing in your opinion to become the king’s son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation?”[18:24] The servants of Saul reported back what David had said.[18:25] And Saul said, “Tell David: The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.” Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.[18:26] When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king’s son-in-law. Before the appointed time,[18:27] he arose and went together with his men and slew a hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and gave them in full to the king, in order to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.[18:28] When Saul saw and knew that the LORD  was with David and his daughter Michal loved him,[18:29] Saul feared David still more, and from that time was David’s enemy.

[18:30] The Philistine commanders continued to come out to battle, and as often as they came out, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute.

 [1 Samuel 19] 

##### David flees Saul #####

[19:1] Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, was very fond of David,[19:2] and told David, “Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now, I beg you, take care in the morning and stay in concealment and hide yourself.[19:3] I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover I will tell you.”[19:4] Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good.[19:5] He took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the LORD  wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause?”[19:6] And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and gave an oath, “As the LORD  lives, David will not be put to death.”[19:7] And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as before.

[19:8] But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him.[19:9] Then an evil spirit from the LORD  came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre.[19:10] And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that Saul hurled the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped.

[19:11] That night Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.”[19:12] Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped.[19:13] Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat’s hair for its head and covered it with the garment.[19:14] When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”[19:15] Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.”[19:16] When the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat’s hair for its pillow.[19:17] And Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me: Let me go, why should I kill you?”

[19:18] Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.[19:19] When Saul was told thqt David was there at Naioth in Ramah,[19:20] he sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophesied.[19:21] When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.[19:22] Then Saul himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone answered, “They are at Naioth in Ramah.”[19:23] But on his journey to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.[19:24] He too stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”

 [1 Samuel 20] 

[20:1] David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin against your father, that he is seeking my life?”[20:2] He replied to him, “Far from it! You will not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me? It can’t be true!”[20:3] David answered, “Your father well knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, ‘Let not Jonathan know this or he will be pained.’ Nevertheless as surely as the LORD  lives, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death.”[20:4] Then Jonathan said to David, “What do you want me to do for you?”[20:5] And David answered Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king. Therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening.[20:6] If your father misses me, then say, ‘David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.’[20:7] If he says ‘Good,’ then it is well with your servant, but if it arouses his anger, then know that he intends evil on me.[20:8] Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. If there is guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”[20:9] And Jonathan said, “No! For if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you.”[20:10] Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, if your father answers you harshly?”[20:11] And Jonathan replied to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field.[20:12] And Jonathan said to David, “The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time tomorrow or the next day, and if is well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you.[20:13] May God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. May the LORD  be with you, as he has been with my father.[20:14] If I am yet alive, show me the kindness of the LORD ! But if I should die,[20:15] continue your kindness to my household forever, even if the LORD  has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”[20:16] So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD  seek out the enemies of David.”[20:17] Jonathan took an oath again with David, because of his love to him. With all his heart he loved him.[20:18] Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.[20:19] On the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you should go to the place where you hid yourself the other time, and sit down there beside the heap of stones.[20:20] I will shoot three arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark.[20:21] Then I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are on this side of you, pick them up!’ – then come; for it is safe for you, and, as the LORD  lives, there is no danger.[20:22] But if I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are beyond you,’, go, for then the LORD  sends you away.[20:23] As to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD  is witness between you and me forever.

[20:24] So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat.[20:25] The king sat upon his seat as usual, on the seat by the wall, with Jonathan opposite, and Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty.[20:26] Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, ‘It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed.’[20:27] But when on the day following the new moon, David’s place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”[20:28] And Jonathan answered Saul, “David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem,[20:29] for he said, ‘Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away and see my brothers.’ Hence he has not come to the king’s table.”

[20:30]  Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “Son of a depraved woman! Don’t I know that you are associated with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?[20:31] For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die.”[20:32] Then Jonathan answered Saul his father “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”[20:33] But Saul lifted up his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death.[20:34] Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him.

[20:35] In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.[20:36] He said to his boy, “Run, find and the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.[20:37] When the boy came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”[20:38] Jonathan cried after the boy, “Hurry, quick, do not stop!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master.[20:39] But the boy had no knowledge of anything. Only Jonathan and David understood what this meant.[20:40] Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”[20:41] As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other.[20:42] Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of the LORD  – the LORD  will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.” Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city.

 [1 Samuel 21] 

[21:1] David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone and no one with you?”[21:2] David answered Ahimelech the priest, “The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you.’ I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place.[21:3] Now if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or whatever can be found, give it to me.”[21:4] The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread at hand. There is holy bread, but only if the young men have kept themselves from women.”[21:5] David answered the priest, “Women have been kept from us, as always when I set out on an expedition. The weapons of the young men were consecrated even on an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their weapons be holy!”[21:6] So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presense, that was taken from before the LORD  in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away.

[21:7] (Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD . His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul’s herdsmen.)[21:8] David said to Ahimelech, “Have you not here at hand a spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter required haste.”[21:9] The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.” And David said, “There is none like that, give it to me.”[21:10] Then David rose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.[21:11] The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Was it not of him that they used to sing to each other in the dances, saying,

|  Saul has slain his thousands,
|  But David his ten thousands?”

[21:12] David took these words to his heart and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.[21:13] He pretended to be insane before them, and raved in their hands and drummed on the doors and let his spittle run down his beard.[21:14] Achish said to his servants, “You see plainly that the man is mad; why do you bring him to me?[21:15] Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act the madman in my presence? Should this one come into my house?”

 [1 Samuel 22] 

[22:1] So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s clan heard of it, they went down there to him.[22:2] Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him.[22:3] David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Let my father and my mother shelter with you, until I know what God will do for me.”[22:4] He left them in the presences of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.[22:5] Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold. Depart and go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.

[22:6] When Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered, he was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him.[22:7] Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, “Listen Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?[22:8] Is that why all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity on me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me, as is now the case?”[22:9] Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.[22:10] He inquired of the LORD  for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”

[22:11] Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king.[22:12] Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub!” He answered, “Here am I, my lord!”[22:13] And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me with the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case?”[22:14] Then Ahimelech answered the king, “But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king’s son-in-law and captain over your retainers and honored in your household?[22:15] Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this.”[22:16] But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan.”[22:17] The king said to the runners who stood before him, “Turn about and slay the priests of the LORD, for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of the LORD .[22:18] Then the king said to Doeg, “Turn and strike down the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore the ephod.[22:19] The priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep.

[22:20] One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David.[22:21] And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the LORD .[22:22] David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan.[22:23] Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine. You will be safe with me.”

 [1 Samuel 23] 

[23:1] David was told that Philistines were fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.[23:2] David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD  said to David, “Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.”[23:3] But David’s men said to him, “Behold we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”[23:4] Then David inquired of the LORD  yet again. And the LORD  answered him, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”[23:5] So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle, inflicting heavy losses on them. In this way David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.

[23:6] When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand.[23:7] When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has sold him into my hand, for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars.”[23:8] And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.[23:9] When David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring here the ephod.”[23:10] And David said, “LORD, God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me.[23:11] Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? LORD, God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.” And the LORD  said, “He will come down.”[23:12] Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD  said, “They will deliver you up.”[23:13] Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and moving from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition.[23:14] So David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hill-country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him continually, but the LORD  did not deliver him into his hand.

[23:15] Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. At that time, he was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha.[23:16] And Jonathan, Saul’s son, came to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God.[23:17] He said to him, “Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you. This Saul my father well knows.”[23:18] The two of them made a covenant before the LORD, and David stayed in Horesha, and Jonathan returned home.

[23:19] Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of Jeshimon?[23:20] Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart’s desire, come down, and it will be our part to deliver him into the king’s hand.”[23:21] Then Saul said, “Blessed may you be of the LORD, for you have had compassion on me.[23:22] Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is very cunning.[23:23] See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah.”

[23:24] So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.[23:25] When Saul and his men went to seek him, David found out and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard, he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon.[23:26] Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them,[23:27] when a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.”[23:28] So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. This is why they call that place the Rock of Divisions.[23:29] David went up from there, and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.

 [1 Samuel 24] 

[24:1] When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.”[24:2] So Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats’ Crags.[24:3] He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave. And Saul went in to relieve himself, while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.[24:4] The men of David said to him, “See this is the day of which the LORD  said to you, ‘Behold, I give your enemy into your hand and you will do to him as you please.’” Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe.[24:5] But afterward David was seized with remorse because he had cut off Saul’s robe.[24:6] He said to his men, “The LORD  forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD ’s anointed, to lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD ’s anointed.”[24:7] So David upbraided his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. When Saul rose from the cave and went on his way,[24:8] David also rose after him and went from the cave and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king.” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the earth, and did obeisance.[24:9] And David said to Saul, “Why did you listen to the words of the men who said, ‘See, David seeks to harm you?’[24:10] Today your eyes see that the LORD  gave you into my hand in the cave, but I refused to kill you and had pity on you, and I said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD ’s anointed.’[24:11] Moreover, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor guilt on my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are aiming to take my life.[24:12] May the LORD  judge between me and you, but my hand will not be against you.[24:13] As runs the proverb of the ancients,

|  Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness.

But my hand will not be raised against you.[24:14] After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea?[24:15] The LORD  therefore be judge and decide between me and you and see and plead my cause and obtain justice for me from you.”

[24:16] Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this not your voice, my son David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept.[24:17] He said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil.[24:18] You have done great good to me in that today, when the LORD  had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me.[24:19] For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound? Therefore may the LORD  reward you richly for what you have done to me this day.[24:20] Now see, I know that you will surely be king, and that through you the kingdom of Israel will be established.[24:21] Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.”[24:22] So David took oath to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.

 [1 Samuel 25] 

[25:1] Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.

Then David arose and went into the Wilderness of Maon.[25:2] There was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.[25:3] The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was sensible and beautiful, but the man was rough and ill-mannered. He was a Calebite.[25:4] David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.[25:5] So he sent ten young men, saying, “Go up to Carmel and enter Nabal’s house and greet him in my name,[25:6] and say to him and to his clan, ‘Peace be to you and your house and all that you have.[25:7] Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not jeer at them, and nothing of theirs was missing all the while they were in Carmel.[25:8] Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a feast day. Give, therefore, whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”

[25:9] When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David and waited as directed.[25:10] But Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Many are the slaves these days who break away, each from his master![25:11] Should I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not where they came from?”[25:12] So David’s young men turned back on their way, and came and reported all these words to him.[25:13] And David said to his men, “Let every man buckle on his sword.” Each man buckled on his sword. And David also buckeled on his sword, and there went up after David about four hundred men while two hundred remained with the baggage.

[25:14] But one of the young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David has just sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them.[25:15] But the men have been very good to us and we have not been jeered at nor have we missed anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.[25:16] They were a wall about us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.[25:17] Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a base scoundrel that no one speak to him.”

[25:18] Then Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five roasted sheep and five mesures of parched grain and a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on donkeys.[25:19] She said to her young men, “Go on before me, I am coming after you.” But she said nothing about it to her husband Nabal.[25:20] Just as she was riding on the donkey and coming down under cover of the mountain, David and his men were also coming down toward her, so that she met them.[25:21] Now David had said, “Surely for nothing did I guard all that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness, so that nothing of all that belongs to him was missing, for he has returned me evil for good.[25:22] God do whatever he will to David, if I leave by daybreak of all who belong to him as much as a single man.”

[25:23] When Abigail saw David, she alighted quickly from her donkey and fell on her face before David and bowed to the ground.[25:24] She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me, my lord, upon me be the guilt. Only let your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your servant.[25:25] Let not my lord pay any attention to that base scoundrel, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he, ‘Reckless Fool,’ is his name and folly is his master, but your maid-servant didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.

[25:26] Now my lord, as the LORD  lives and as you live, since the LORD  has kept you from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering yourself by your own hand – and may your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal –[25:27] let this present, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord[25:28] Forgive, I pray the trespass of your servant, for the LORD  will certainly make for my lord a secure house, for my lord is fighting the wars of the LORD, and no evil will be found in you as long as you live.[25:29] Should a man rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD  your God, but the lives of your enemies will he sling out as from the hollow of a sling.[25:30] When the LORD  has done to my lord all the good that he has promised you and has made you prince over Israel,[25:31] then this will not be a qualm or a burden on the conscience of my lord, that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has delivered himself by his own hand. When the LORD  gives prosperity to my lord, then remember your servant.”

[25:32] David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,[25:33] and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you yourself, who have kept me this day from committing an act of bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.[25:34] For as sure as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from doing you harm, except you had quickly come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by daybreak so much as one man.”[25:35] So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and to her he said, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your advice, and granted your request.”

[25:36] But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk, so that she did not tell him anything at all until day break.[25:37] But then in the morning when the effects of the wine were gone from Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him and he became a stone.[25:38] At the end of about ten days the LORD  struck Nabal, so that he died.

[25:39] Now when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD  who has avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil. The evil-doing of Nabal the LORD  brought back upon his own head.” Then David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife.

[25:40] When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife,”[25:41] She rose and bowed with her face to the earth and said, “See, your slave is willing to be a servant to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”[25:42] Abigail quickly arose and mounted an donkey, and five maids followed as servants. So she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife.

[25:43] David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.[25:44] But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim.

 [1 Samuel 26] 

[26:1] Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “David is hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert.”[26:2] Accordingly Saul arose, and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand men of Israel, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.[26:3] Saul encamped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah overlooking Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness,[26:4] David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come there after him,[26:5] so he arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul lay within the barricade, and the people were encamped around about him.

[26:6] Then David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”[26:7] So David and Abishai went to the army by night. Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him.[26:8] Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to strike him twice!”[26:9] But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lay his hand upon the LORD ’s anointed and be innocent?”[26:10] David said, “As the LORD  lives, either the LORD  will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and be destroyed.[26:11] The LORD  forbid that I should lift my hand against the LORD ’s anointed, but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go.”[26:12] So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul’s head and they departed. No man saw it of knew it neither did any awake, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the LORD  had fallen upon them.

[26:13] Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them.[26:14] And David cried to the army and to Abner, the son of Ner, “Do you make no answer Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you that calls to the king?”[26:15] And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord.[26:16] This that you have done is not good. As the LORD  lives, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD ’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.”[26:17] Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”[26:18] He said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty?[26:19] Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD  has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it was men, cursed be they before the LORD, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go serve other gods.’[26:20] Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains.”

[26:21] Then Saul said, “I have done wrong. Return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly.”[26:22] And David answered, “There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it.[26:23] And the LORD  will reward each man’s righteousness and fidelity, for the LORD  delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the LORD ’a anointed.[26:24] Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the LORD ’s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction.”[26:25] Then Saul said to David, “Be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and will surely succeed!” So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place.

 [1 Samuel 27] 

##### David among the Philistines #####

[27:1] Then David said to himself, “I will be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”[27:2] So David set out, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.[27:3] David stayed with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow.[27:4] When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more.

[27:5] David Said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let a place in one of the towns in the open country be given me, that I may live there, for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”[27:6] So Achish gave him Ziklag at that time, therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.[27:7] The length of the time that David lived in the open country of the Philistines was a year and four months.

[27:8] David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these tribes live in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt.[27:9] As often as David struck the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish.[27:10] When Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” David answered, “Against the Negreb of Judah”, or “against the Negreb of the Jerahmeelites”, or “against the Negreb of the Kenites.”[27:11] But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, “They might give information against us and say, ‘David has done this, or that.’” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the open country of the Philistines.[27:12] And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has brought himself into ill odor with his people Israel, therefore he will be my servant forever.”

 [1 Samuel 28] 

[28:1] Now in those days the Philistines assembled their forces to make a campaign against Israel. Achish said to David, “You know thqt you must, together with your men,  go with me along with the forces.”[28:2] David said to Achish, “Good, you will now know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “I will make you my bodyguard from this time on.”

[28:3] Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had banished the mediums and magicians out of the land.[28:4] When the Philistines assembled and came and encamped in Shunem, Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.[28:5] When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart was filled with apprehension.[28:6] Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD  did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.[28:7] Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire through her.” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at Endor.”

[28:8] So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, taking two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. He said, “Tell my future by consulting the dead, call up for me the one whom I name to you.”[28:9] The woman said to him, Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has banished the mediums and the magicians from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to put me to death?”[28:10] And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD  lives, no guilt will come upon you for this.”[28:11] Then the woman said, “Whom should I bring up to you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel.”[28:12] When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. The woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul?”[28:13] The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”[28:14] He said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the earth in respect.

[28:15] Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am in great trouble, for the Philistines are making war against me and God has turned from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have called you to tell me what I should do.”[28:16] And Samuel said, “Why do you ask of me when the LORD  has turned from you and become your adversary?[28:17] The LORD  has done to you as he declared by me, and the LORD  has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David.[28:18] Because you did not heed the voice of the LORD, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, the LORD  has done this thing to you today.[28:19] The LORD  will deliver Israel into the power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the LORD  will deliver the army of Israel into the power of the Philistines.”

[28:20] Then Saul fell at once at full length upon the earth and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel, and he had no strength in him, for he had not eaten bread during all the day and all the night.[28:21] When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, “Your servant has heeded your voice, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.[28:22] Now therefore, listen also to the advice of your servant and let me set before you a morsel of meat, and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way.”[28:23] But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman urged him, until he listened to their advice. So he rose from the earth and sat upon the couch.[28:24] The woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and took flour and kneaded it and baked from it unleavened bread.[28:25] She set it before Saul and his servants and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.

 [1 Samuel 29] 

[29:1] The Philistines had assembled their forces at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel.[29:2] The lords of the Philistines were marching past, with hundreds and with thousands, and David and his men marched in the rear guard with Achish.[29:3] Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “This is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has now been with me two years, and I have found no fault in him from the time that he came over to me to the present.”[29:4] But the commanders of the Philistines were enraged against him, and said, “Send back the man so that he may return to the place where you have stationed him. Don’t let him go down with us to battle – he might become an adversary to us. How could this fellow better ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of our men?[29:5] Is this not the David of whom they sang responsively in the dances, saying,

|  Saul has slain his thousands,
|  But David his ten thousands?”

[29:6] Then Achish called to David and said to him, “As the LORD  lives, you are upright, and it is my desire that you should go out and fight with me, for I have found no evil in you from the time that you came to me to the present, but you are not regarded favorably by the lords.[29:7] Therefore now return and go in peace, so that you do nothing to displease the lords of the Philistines.”[29:8] David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant fromt the day that I entered into your service to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”[29:9] And Achish answered David, “I know that you are as good in my sight as a Messenger of God, but the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’[29:10] Therefore now rise early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place where I have stationed you, and do not entertain any evil design in your heart, for you are good in my sight, but rise early in the morning and as soon as it is light, depart.”[29:11] So David rose early, together with his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.

 [1 Samuel 30] 

##### David returns #####

[30:1] Now when David and his men  on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South Country and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burnt it down,[30:2] and had carried away captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way.[30:3] When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive.[30:4] Then David and the people who were with him wept aloud until they were no longer able to weep.[30:5] David’s two wives had been take captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.[30:6] David was in great trouble, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the spirit of all the people was embittered, each for his sons and for his daughters.

David strengthened himself in reliance on the LORD  his God,[30:7] and said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring here to me the ephod.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.[30:8] David inquired of the LORD, saying,

|  Should I pursue this marauding band?
|    Should I overtake them?”

He answered him,

|  “Pursue,
|    For you will surely overtake,
|    You will surely rescue.”

[30:9] So David went, together with the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those who were left behind remained.[30:10] But David pursued together with four hundred men, while two hundred remained behind, who were too faint to cross the Wadi Besor.

[30:11] They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him food to eat and water to drink,[30:12] and they gave him a piece of fig cake, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and nights.[30:13] David said to him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” He said “I am an Egyptian lad, an Amalekite’s servant, and my master abandoned me because three days ago I fell sick.[30:14] We made a raid upon the South Country of the Cherethites and on that which belongs to Judah and upon the South Country of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned down.”[30:15] And David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?” He said, “Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.”

[30:16] When he had brought him down, there they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, on account of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.[30:17] And David struck them from twilight to the following evening in order to destroy them completely. None escaped except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.[30:18] David recovered all the people whom the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.[30:19] There was nothing missing, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken to themselves – David brought it all back.[30:20] He took all the flocks and the herds and drove those animals before the people, and they said, “This is David’s spoil.”

[30:21] Now when David came to the two hundred men, who had been too faint to follow him, so that he had to leave them behind at the Wadi Besor, they went out to meet David, and the people who were with him. When they came near to the people, he saluted them.[30:22] Then all the wicked and base scoundrels among the men who went with David began to say, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each, his wife and his children, that he may take them away and depart.”[30:23] But David said, No! My brothers, you must not do this with that which the LORD  has given us – after he has preserved us and delivered the marauding band that came against us into our hand.[30:24] Who will give heed to you in this matter? For:

|  As is the share of him who goes down into battle,
|  So is the share of him who remains with the baggage.
|  They must share alike.”

[30:25] From that time on he made it a statute and precedent in Israel to this day.

[30:26] When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, “See! a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD,[30:27] to them who were in Bethel, in Ramoth in the South Country, in Jattir,[30:28] in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa,[30:29] in Carmel, in the cities of Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites,[30:30] in Hormah, Bor-ashan, in Athach,[30:31] in Hebron, and to those in all the places where David and his men had stayed.

 [1 Samuel 31] 

[31:1] Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.[31:2] The Philistines followed close after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.[31:3] They pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.[31:4] Then said Saul to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, lest these uncircumcised Philistines come and make sport of me.” But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.[31:5] When his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.[31:6] So Saul and his three sons and his armorbearer died together on the same day.[31:7] When the Israelites who were in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they also left the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and occupied them.

[31:8] When on the following day the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.[31:9] They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to bring the good news to their idols and to the people.[31:10] They put his armor in the temple of Ashtarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Beth-shan.[31:11] When the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,[31:12] all the valiant men arose and marched all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beths-han. They returned to Jabesh and burned them there.[31:13] They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.

 [Esther 1] 

##### The Follies of a Despot #####

[1:1] These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia[1:2] from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.

[1:3] In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present[1:4] while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.

[1:5] When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.[1:6] There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.[1:7] Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.[1:8] The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.[1:9] Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.

[1:10] On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants[1:11] to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.[1:12] But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.

[1:13] The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.[1:14] Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.[1:15] “Queen Vashit”, the king said, “has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?”

[1:16] Memucan replied before the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.[1:17] The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!’[1:18] This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife![1:19] If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.[1:20] When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honor to their husbands.”

[1:21] The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.[1:22] He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!

 [Esther 2] 

##### Choosing a Queen #####

[2:1] Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.[2:2] Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,[2:3] and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,[2:4] and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.

[2:5] In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.[2:6] (Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)[2:7] Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.

[2:8] When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.[2:9] The girl pleased him and gained his favor, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.[2:10] Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.[2:11] Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.

[2:12] The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,[2:13] each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,[2:14] and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.[2:15] When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.[2:16] Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.[2:17] And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favorite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.[2:18] Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honor of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.

[2:19] All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.[2:20] Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.

##### Hatred without Pity #####

[2:21] In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.[2:22] But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.[2:23] When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.

 [Esther 3] 

[3:1] After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.[3:2] All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.

[3:3] Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”[3:4] When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.[3:5] When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.[3:6] But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.

[3:7] In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had ‘pur’ (which means ‘lot’) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.

[3:8] So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.[3:9] If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.”[3:10] So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.[3:11] “The money is yours,” the king said to Haman, “and the people also to do with them as you wish.”[3:12] And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.[3:13] Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.[3:14] A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.[3:15] By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.

Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.

 [Esther 4] 

##### A Queen’s Efforts to Save Her People #####

[4:1] When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.[4:2] He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.[4:3] In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.

[4:4] When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behavior, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.[4:5] So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.

[4:6] So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.[4:7] Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.[4:8] Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.

[4:9] When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,[4:10] she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,[4:11] “All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.”

[4:12] When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,[4:13] he sent back this reply to Esther, “Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.[4:14] If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!”

[4:15] Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:[4:16] “Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.”[4:17] Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.

 [Esther 5] 

[5:1] On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.[5:2] When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favor, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.[5:3] Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.”

[5:4] “If it seems best to the king,” Esther said, “let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”[5:5] Then the king ordered, “Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.”

So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.[5:6] While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.”[5:7] Esther answered,[5:8] “If I have won the king’s favor and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.”

[5:9] Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.[5:10] Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife[5:11] and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.[5:12] “What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.[5:13] Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”

[5:14] Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.

 [Esther 6] 

##### Downfall of a Conspirator #####

[6:1] On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king.[6:2] It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.[6:3] “What honor and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?” the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied “Nothing has been done for him,”[6:4] the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.[6:5] So the king’s pages said to him, “Haman is standing there, in the court.” The king said, “Let him enter.”[6:6] So Haman entered, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom besides me could the king wish to honor?”[6:7] So he said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor[6:8] let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.[6:9] Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’”

[6:10] Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.”[6:11] So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.”

[6:12] Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.[6:13] Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.”

[6:14] While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

 [Esther 7] 

[7:1] So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther.[7:2] As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.”[7:3] Then Queen Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if I have won your favor, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request,[7:4] for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.”

[7:5] Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?”

[7:6] “A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.” Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen.[7:7] In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him.[7:8] As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, “Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?”

As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman’s face[7:9] and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, “There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!” The king said “Hang him on them.”[7:10] So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified.

 [Esther 8] 

##### Deliverance of the Jews #####

[8:1] At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her.[8:2] The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.

[8:3] Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.[8:4] The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.[8:5] “If it seems best to the king,” she said, “and if I have won his favor and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.[8:6] For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?”[8:7] Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.[8:8] Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”

[8:9] On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.

[8:10] Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.[8:11] In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder[8:12] throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).[8:13] A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.[8:14] So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands!

Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa;[8:15] and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.[8:16] To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honor.[8:17] And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.

 [Esther 9] 

[9:1] Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.[9:2] The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.[9:3] All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.[9:4] For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.[9:5] The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.[9:6] In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.[9:7] They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,[9:8] Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,[9:9] Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,[9:10] the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.

[9:11] On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,[9:12] and the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.”

[9:13] “If it please the king,” Esther said, “let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”[9:14] And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.[9:15] The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.[9:16] And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.[9:17] This was on the thirteenth day of Adar.

On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.[9:18] (But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)

[9:19] This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.

##### The Establishment of Purim #####

[9:20] Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.[9:21] He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,[9:22] as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.

[9:23] So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.[9:24] For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast ‘Pur’, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.[9:25] But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.[9:26] This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,[9:27] the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,[9:28] and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.

[9:29] Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.[9:30] He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,[9:31] to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.[9:32] And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.

 [Esther 10] 

[10:1] King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.[10:2] All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?[10:3] For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.


JOB
===

##### The Prologue #####

#### Job’s Piety and Prosperity ####

 [Job 1] 

[1:1] In the land of Uz there was a man called Job–a man blameless and upright, who feared God and[1:2] shunned evil. He had a family of seven sons and[1:3] three daughters: and he owned seven thousandsheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yokeof oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a vast train ofservants, so that he was the richest man in all the[1:4] East. Now his sons used to hold feast day about,and they would send and invite their three sisters[1:5] to eat and drink with them; and when the cycleof feasts was over, Job used to send for them andprepare them for worship, rising early and offeringburnt offerings for them all: for – said Job–
|    Perchance my children have sinned
|    And cursed God in their heart.And this Job never failed to do.

#### The Heavenly Council. Satan is permitted to test the Quality of Job’s Piety ####

[1:6] Now on a certain day the heavenly Beingscame to present themselves before Jehovah, and[1:7] among them came Satan. Then Jehovah askedSatan where he had come from, and Satan answeredJehovah thus, "From ranging the earth and from[1:8] walking up and down it." Then Jehovah said toSatan:

|  "Hast thou noted my servant Job,
|    That on earth there is none like him–
|  A man blameless and upright,
|    Who fears God and shuns evil?"
|  [1:9] To this Satan made answer:
|  But is it for nothing that Job fears God?
|  [1:10] Hast Thou not Thyself fenced him and his house,
|    And all he possesses on every side?
|  The work of his hands Thou hast blessed,
|    And his substance abounds in the land.
|  [1:11] But put forth Thy hand and touch all he possesses,
|    And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee."
|  [1:12] Whereat Jehovah said to Satan:
|  "See! all he possesses is in thy power,
|    But lay not thy hand on the man himself."
|  Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah.

#### The Blows Fall ####
[1:13] Now on a certain day, as his sons and daughtersWere eating and drinking wine in the house of their[1:14] eldest brother, suddenly a messenger appearedbefore Job with the tidings:
|  "The oxen were hard at the plough;
|    And the asses were feeding beside them,
|  [1:15] When sabeans fell upon them and seized them;
|    The servants they slew with the sword–
|    Only I alone am escaped to tell thee."
|  [1:16] While he was still speaking, another came and said:
|    "The fire of God has fallen from heaven,
|    And burnt to a cinder the sheep and the servants–
|    Only I alone am escaped to tell thee."
|  [1:17] While he was still speaking, another came and said:
|  "Chaldeans, formed into three bands,
|    Made a raid on the camels and seized them.
|  The servants they slew with the sword–
|    Only I alone am escaped to tell thee."
|  [1:18] While he was still speaking, another came and said:
|  "Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking
|    In the house of their eldest brother:
|  [1:19] On a sudden a mighty wind
|    From the other side of the desert
|  came and smote and four sides of the house,
|    That it fell on the young folk and killed them–
|    Only I alone am escaped to tell thee."
|  [1:20] Then Job rose and rent his robe; and, after shaving
|  his head, he threw himself with these words pros-
|  trate upon the ground:
|  [1:21] "Naked came I from my mother’s womb,
|    And naked thither must I return.
|  Jehovah hath given, Jehovah hath taken:
|    The name of Jehovah be blessed."
|  [1:22] In all this Job committed no sin, nor did he charge
|  God with unseemly dealing.

#### The Second Council ####

 [Job 2] 

[2:1] Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings cameto present themselves before Jehovah, and amongthem came Satan to present himself before Jehovah.[2:2] Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from,and satan answered Jehovah thus, "From rangingthe earth and from walking up and down it."[2:3] Then Jehovah said to Satan:

|  "Hast thou noted my servant Job,
|    That on earth there is none like him–
|  A man blameless and upright,
|    Who fears God and shuns evil?
|  And still he clings to his honour–
|    In vain hast thou set me on to destroy him."
|  [2:4] To this Satan made answer:
|    "Skin for skin;
|    All a man’s goods will he give for his life.
|  [2:5] But put forth Thy hand, touch his bone and his flesh
|    And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee."
|  [2:6] Whereat Jehovah said to Satan:
|    "See! he is on thy power,
|    But take heed that thou spare his life."
|  [2:7] Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah.

#### The Second Test ####

And he smote Job from the sole of his foot to the[2:8] crown of his head with boils so grievous that hetook a potsherd to scratch with; and, as he was[2:9] sitting among the ashes, his wife said to him:

|  "Art thou clinging still to thine honour?
|    Curse God and die."
|  [2:10] But Job said to her:
|    "Must thou too speak
|    As a foolish women speak?
|  We accept from God what is good:
|    Shall we not accept what is evil?"
|  In all this Job was guilty of no sin of speech.

#### Job’s Friends Come to Comfort Him ####

[2:11] When Job’s three friends heard of all the miserythat had come upon him, they travelled each manfrom his own place – Eliphaz the Temabite, Bildadthe Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for theyhad made a tyrst together to come to condole with[2:12] him and comfort him. But when they caught aglimpse of him at a distance they did not recognizehim. Then every man of them wept aloud andtore his robe and scattered dust heavenwards upon[2:13] his head. Then they sat down beside him upon theground seven days and nights, and no one said a wordto him; for they saw that his pain was very great.

 [Job 3] 

[3:1] Thereafter Job opened his mouth to curse his[3:2] day, and thus he began:

##### ACT 1 #####

#### Job’s Lament and Longing for Death ####

|  [3:3] Perished the day wherein I was born,
|    And the night which announced that a man-child had come.
|  [3:4a] Utter darkness let that night be,
|    [3:9b] Looking for light, but finding none.
|  [3:4b] May God in the heights above ask not after it,
|    [3:4c] And may no beam shine forth upon it.
|  [3:5] May darkness and gloom claim it for their own,
|    And may the thick cloud rest upon it.
|  Black vapours of the day affright it!
|    [3:6] And let the thick darkness snatch it away.
|  May it not be joined to the days of the year,
|    Or enter into the tale of the months.
|  [3:7] As for that night, let it be barren:
|    May there never ring through it a cry of joy.
|  [3:8] Accursed of sorcerers be that day–
|    Of those that are skilful to stir up Leviathan.
|  [3:9a] Dark be the stars of its morning twilight,
|    [3:9c] And never the eyelids of Dawn may it see;
|  [3:10] Since it shut not the doors of my mother’s womb,
|    And hid not trouble from mine eyes.
|  [3:11] Why died I not at my birth,
|    Breathe my last as I came from the womb,
|  [3:16] Like a hidden untimely birth,
|    Like infants that never see light?
|  [3:12] Why on the knees was I welcomed,
|    And why were there breasts to suck?
|  [3:13] For then had I lain down in quiet,
|    Then had I slept and had rest–
|  [3:14] With kings of the earth and with cousellors,
|    Who built stately tombs for themselves,
|  [3:15] Or with princes rich in gold,
|    Who had filled their houses with silver.
|  [3:17] There the wicked cease their tumult,
|    There the weary are at rest–
|  [3:18] Prisoners at ease together,
|    Deaf to the taskmaster’s voice.
|  [3:19] There the small and the great are alike,
|    And the servants is free from his master.
|  [3:20] Why is light given to the wretched,
|    And life to the bitter in soul,
|  [3:23] To the man whose path is obscured,
|    Who is hedged round about by God–
|  [3:21] Such as long for death, but it comes not,
|    And dig for it more than for treasure,
|  [3:22] Who would joy o’er a mound of stones,
|    And rejoice, could they find a grave?
|  [3:24] For my bread there comes to me sighing,
|    My groans are poured out like water.
|  [3:25] For the evil I fear overtakes me,
|    The things that I dread comes upon me.
|  [3:26] Scarce have I ease or quiet
|    Or rest, when tumult cometh.

#### Eliphaz’s Comfortable Exhortation and Revelation ####

 [Job 4] 

[4:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:[4:2] May we lift up a word unto thee who art fainting,
|    For who has the heart to restrain his speech?

|  [4:3] see! thou hast instructed many,
|    And strengthened the drooping hands.
|  [4:4] Thy words used to set up the stumbling,
|    And strengthen the tottering knees.
|  [4:5] But now that it comes upon thee, thou art faint;
|    Now that it reaches thyself, thou art terrified.
|  [4:6] Is not thy religion thy confidence,
|    And thy blameless life thy hope?
|  [4:7] Bethink thee: has an innocent man ever perished,
|    Or when have the just been cut off?
|  [4:8] It is those who plough wrong and sow trouble
|    That reap it: – for this have I seen.
|  [4:9] By the breath of God they perish,
|    At the blast of HIs anger they vanish.
|  [4:10] The Lion roared, the hoarse lion thundered:
|    But his young lion’s teeth were broken.
|  [4:11] So for lack of prey he perished,
|    And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
|  [4:12] Now to me a word came stealing,
|    And mine ear caught a whisper thereof,
|  [4:13] In thoughts from the visions of night,
|    When deep sleep falleth on men.
|  [4:14] Fear came upon me and trembling,
|    That made my bones all quake.
|  [4:15] Then a breath passed over my face,
|    The hair of my flesh bristled up.
|  [4:16] There – it – stood.
|    I could not tell what it looked like–
|  This form before mine eyes.
|    In the silence I heard a voice say:
|  [4:17] "Can mortal be just before God,
|    Or a man clean before his Creator?
|  [4:18] See! He putteth no trust in His servants,
|    His angels He chargeth with folly.
|  [4:19] How much more those whose houses are clay,
|    Whose very foundation is dust,
|  Who die before the moth,

[4:20] Crushed between morning and evening,

|  Bruised without any regarding it,
|    Perished for evermore!
|  [4:21] The cord of their tent is torn from them:
|    They die – but without learning wisdom."

 [Job 5] 

|  [5:1] Call now: will any one answer?
|    To which of the saints wilt thou turn?
|  [5:2] For vexation killeth the fool,
|    Indignation slayeth the simpleton.
|  [5:3] I have seen a fool taking root,
|    But his branch became suddenly rotten,
|  [5:4] His children were far from help,
|    Crushed beyond hope deliverance.
|  [5:5] The hungry eat up their harvest,
|    And the thirsty draw from their wells.
|  [5:6] For not from the dust riseth ruin,
|    Nor out of the ground springeth trouble;
|  [5:7] But man is born unto trouble,
|    While the sons of flame soar above it.
|  [5:8] Were it I, I would seek unto God;
|    My cause I would bring before God,
|  [5:9] Who doeth great things and unsearchable,
|    Marvellous things without number,
|  [5:10] Who bringeth rain over the earth,
|    And over the fields sendeth water–
|  [5:11] Setting the lowly on high,
|    And lifting the mourners to safety,
|  [5:12] Frustrating the plots of the crafty
|    And robbing their hands of success,
|  [5:13] So taking the wise in their guile,
|    That their tortuous plans fail through rashness:
|  [5:14] They feel in the day as in darkness,
|    At noontide they grope as at night.
|  [5:15] So the needy He saves from the sword,
|    And the poor from the hands of the mighty.
|  [5:16] Thus hope is born in the weak,
|    And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
|  [5:17] Happy then the mortal whom God correcteth:
|    So spurn no thou the Almighty’s chastening.
|  [5:18] For He bindeth the wounds He hath made,
|    And His hands heal the hurt He hath dealt.
|  [5:19] He will save thee in six distresses,
|    In seven no evil shall touch thee.
|  [5:20] In famine He frees thee from death,
|    And in war from the power of the sword.
|  [5:21] From the scourge of tongue thou art safe;
|    Thou shalt fear not the onslaught of ruin.
|  [5:22] At ruin and dearth shalt thou laugh,
|    And the beasts of the field thou shalt fear not.
|  [5:23] For the stones of the earth are thine allies,
|    The beasts of the field are thy friends.
|  [5:24] Thou shalt know that thy tent is secure,
|    Thou shalt visit thy fold and miss nothing.
|  [5:25] Thy seed thou shalt know to be many,
|    Thine offspring as grass of the earth.
|  [5:26] Thou shalt come to the grave in thy strength,
|    As a sheaf cometh in its season.
|  [5:27] See! this we have searched – so it is.
|    We have heard it – lay thou it to heart.

#### Job’s Denunciation of Hollow Friendship. His Challenge ####
of God and His Longing to be Gone

 [Job 6] 

|    [6:1] Then Job answered and said:
|  [6:2] O could my vexation be carefully weighed,
|    And my misery set in the balance against it!
|  [6:3] For it is more heavy than sand of the sea,
|    And therefore it is that my words are wild.
|  [6:4] For the arrows of God Almighty are in me,
|    My spirit drinketh their fiery poison.
|  The terrors of God are arrayed against me,
|    [6:7a] My soul refuseth to be at rest.
|  [6:5] Doth the wild ass bray as he nibbles the grass,
|    And over their fodder do oxen low?
|  [6:6] Can a man eat that which is tasteless and saltless?
|    Is there any taste in the slime of the yolk?
|  [6:8] O that I might have my request,
|    That God would grant me the thing that I long for!
|  [6:9] O that God would consent to crush me,
|    To let His hand loose and cut me off!
|  [6:10] So should I still have this for my comfort–
|    Leaping for joy amid torture unsparing–
|    That I had not concealed the words of the Holy One.
|  [6:11] What is my strength, that I should endure?
|  Or what is mine end, that I should be patient?
|  [6:12] Is my strength the strength of stones?
|    Or was I created with flesh of brass?
|  [6:13] Behold! I have no help in myself,
|    And the power to achieve is driven from me.
|  [6:14] To one who is fainting a friend should be kind,
|    Even though he forsaketh the fear of Almighty
|  [6:15] But my brethen have dealt like a treacherous torrent,
|    Like channels that overflow their banks,
|  [6:16] Which are turbid because of the ice
|    And the snow that hides within them;
|  [6:17] But, when they are scorched, they vanish:
|    In the heat they are quenched from their place.
|  [6:18] The caravans bend their course thither,
|    Go up through the waste, and perish.
|  [6:19] The caravans of Tema looked out for them,
|    The companies of Sheba kept hoping:
|  [6:20] But their confidence brought them to shame;
|    When they came to the place, they blushed.
|  [6:21] Such now have ye proved unto me:
|    When ye look on the terror, ye shudder.
|  [6:22] Did I ask you to give me a present,
|    Or make me a gift of your substance,
|  [6:23] To rescue me from the foe,
|    Or from hand of the tyrant to free me?
|  [6:24] Teach me, and I will be silent;
|    Show me wherein I have erred.
|  [6:25] How sweet are words that are true!
|    But when you reprove, what is reproved?
|  [6:26] Is it words that ye mean to reprove?
|    But for winds are the words of despair.
|  [6:27] Would ye throw yourselves on the innocent,
|    Or make an assault on your friend?
|  [6:28] Now look upon me, I pray you:
|    I would surely not lie in your face.
|  [6:29] O turn back – let there be no injustice:
|    Turn back, for the right is still mine.
|  [6:30] Is my tongue altogether perverted?
|    Have I lost the sense of wrong?

 [Job 7] 

|  [7:1] Hath man on the earth not a warfare,
|    With days like the days of a hireling?
|  [7:2] Like a slave that pants for the shadow,
|    A hireling that longs for his wages,
|  [7:3] So empty months are my portion,
|    And wearisome nights mine appointment.
|  [7:4] I lie down, saying, "When cometh day?"
|    When I rise, methinks, "When cometh even?"
|    I am full of unrest till the dawn.
|  [7:5] Worms and clods clothe my flesh;
|    My skin grows hard and then breaks.
|  [7:6] My days are more swift than a shuttle;
|    They come to an end without hope.
|  [7:7] O remember my life is but breath;
|    Mine eyes shall see good nevermore.
|  [7:8] The eye that now sees me shall see me no more;
|    Thine eyes shall look for me, but I shall be gone.
|  [7:9] Like the cloud that is spent and that passeth away,
|    He that goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.
|  [7:10] He shall never come back to his house again,
|    And the place that was his shall know him no more.
|  [7:11] So my mouth I will not restrain,
|    I will utter mine anguish of spirit,
|    Pour out mine embittered soul.
|  [7:12] Am I a sea or a sea-monster,
|    That upon me Thou settest a watch?
|  [7:13] When I look to my couch to comfort me,
|    To my bed for relief of my sorrow,
|  [7:14] Then Thou scarest me with dreams,
|    And with visions dost so affright me,
|  [7:15] That gladly would I be strangled:
|    Death itself I spurn in my pain.
|  [7:16] I would not live for ever:
|    Let me go, for my days are but breath.
|  [7:17] What is man, that so great Thou dost count him
|    And settest Thine heart upon him–
|  [7:18] Visiting him every morning,
|    And testing him moment by moment?
|  [7:19] O when wilt Thou turn Thine eyes from me,
|    And leave me though but for a moment?
|  [7:20] If I sin, how does that harm Thee,
|    O Thou who art Watcher of men?
|  Why dost Thou make me Thy target?
|    Why burden Thyself with me?
|  [7:21] Why not forgive my sin,
|    And pass mine iniquity by?
|  For now I shall lie in the dust;
|    Thou shalt search, but I shall not be.

#### Bildad’s Appeal to the Teaching of Tradition ####

 [Job 8] 

|    [8:1] And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
|  [8:2] How long wilt thou utter these things–
|    These thy blustering windy words?
|  [8:3] Is God a perverter of justice?
|    The Almighty subverter of right?
|  [8:4] If thy children, for sinning against Him,
|    He has left to bear their transgressions,
|  [8:5] Yet seek thou thyself unto God,
|    And supplicate the Almighty.
|  [8:6] And if thou art pure and upright,
|    Thy righteous abode He will prosper;
|  [8:7] And, though thy beginning be slender,
|    Thine end He shall greatly increase.
|  [8:8] For inquire thou of past generations,
|    Regard the search of the fathers:–
|  [8:9] For we are but dullards of yesterday,
|    Whose days on the earth are a shadow–
|  [8:10] Shall they not give thee instruction,
|    And bring forth words out of their heart?
|  [8:11] Can the rush shoot high without swamp,
|    Or the reed grow up without water?
|  [8:12] While yet in its freshness, unplucked,
|    Of all herbs it withers most quickly.
|  [8:13] So end all who put God out of mind.
|    And the hope of the hypocrite dies.
|  [8:14] His confidence is but a thread,
|    And his trust as the web of a spider.
|  [8:15] He leans on his house, but it stands not:
|    He grasps, but it cannot endure.
|  [8:16] Like a plant is he, fresh in the sunshine,
|    With suckers that shoot o’er the garden.
|  [8:17] Its roots are entwined round the well,
|    It lays hold of its stone habitation,
|  [8:18] But when it is ruined, the spot
|    Denies having ever beheld it.
|  [8:19] Thus its course ends in desolation
|    And out of the dust springs another."
|  [8:20] See! God spurns not an innocent man,
|    But He will not uphold evildoers.
|  [8:21] He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter
|    Thy lips with a shout of joy.
|  [8:22] Thy foes shall be clothed with shame,
|    And the tent of the wicked shall vanish.

#### Job’s Challenge of Immoral Omnipotence ####

 [Job 9] 

|    [9:Then] Job answered and said:
|  [9:2] Yes, truly: I know it is so:
|    But with God how can man urge his right?
|  [9:3] Should He choose to contend against him,
|    He could answer not one in a thousand.
|  [9:4] Wise-hearted and strong as He is,
|    Who hath ever successfully braved Him?
|  [9:5] Mountains He moves without effort,
|    He turns them about in His anger.
|  [9:6] He shaketh the earth from her place,
|    And maketh her pillars shudder.
|  [9:7] He speaks to the sun, and it shines not;
|    He setteth a seal on the stars.
|  [9:8] He strecheth the heavens all alone;
|    He treadeth the heights of the sea.
|  [9:9] He maketh the Bear and Orion.
|    The Pleiades and the southern chambers.
|  [9:10] He doeth great things and unsearchable,
|    Marvellous things without number.
|  [9:11] Lo! He passes me by all unseen;
|    Sweeps past – but I cannot perceive Him.
|  [9:12] He seizeth, and who can prevent Him?
|    Who dare ask Him, "What doest Thou?"
|  [9:13] God will not withdraw His anger;
|    The helpers of Rahab stooped under Him:
|  [9:14] How much less can I give Him answer,
|    And choose out my words against Him?
|  [9:15] Were I right, I could give Him no answer,
|    But needs must entreat my Judge.
|  [9:16] If I called, He would give me no answer;
|    I cannot believe He would listen.
|  [9:17] For He Crushes me in a temptest
|    With many a wanton wound.
|  [9:18] He suffers me not to take breath,
|    But with bitterness He fills me.
|  [9:19] Is it question of strength? There He is.
|    Or of justice? Then who will implead Him?
|  [9:20] Am I right? Still mine own mouth condemns me.
|    Innocent? He proveth me perverse.
|  [9:21] Innocent I am – but I reck not.
|    I spurn my life; ’tis all one.
|  [9:22] And therefore it is that I say,
|    "He destroyeth both guiltless and guilty."
|  [9:23] When the scourge bringeth sudden death,
|    The despair of the blameless He mocketh.
|  [9:24] He hath given up the earth to the wicked;
|    He veileth the face of its judges.
|    If it be not He, who then?
|  [9:25] My days are more swift than a runner,
|    They flee unillumined by joy.
|  [9:26] They glide like the ships of reed,
|    Like an eagle that darts on its prey.
|  [9:27] If I vow to forget my plaint
|    And to wear a bright face for a joyless,
|  [9:28] I shudder at all my pains;
|    I know Thou wilt not hold me guiltless.
|  [9:29] I then am I infallibly guilty,
|    So why should I labour in vain?
|  [9:30] For though I wash me with snow,
|    And cleanse my hands with lye,
|  [9:31] Thou wouldst plunge me then in the mire,
|    So that even my friends would abhor me.
|  [9:32] Thou art not a man like myself,
|    That we come into judgment together.
|  [9:33] O for an umpire between us,
|    To lay his hand on us both!
|  [9:34] Let Him take but His rod from off me,
|    And affright me no more with His terrors,
|  [9:35] And then I would speak unafraid–
|    For not such at heart am I.

 [Job 10] 

|  [10:1] In my soul is a loathing of life,
|    I will let my complaint loose against Him.
|  [10:2] I will say to God, "Do not condemn me,
|    But show me the ground of Thy quarrel.
|  [10:3] What dost Thou gain from oppressing
|    And spurning the work of Thy hands?
|  [10:4] Hast Thou then eyes of flesh?
|    Or seest Thou as man seeth?
|  [10:5] Are Thy days like the days of mortals,
|  Or Thy years like the days of man,
|  [10:6] That Thou shouldest seek out my guilt,
|    And make this search for my sin,
|  [10:7] Though Thou knowest I am not guilty.
|    And no treachery cleaves to my hand?
|  [10:8] Thy hands did fashion and mould me;
|    And now wilt Thou turn and destroy me?
|  [10:9] Remember Thou madest me like clay,
|    And back to the dust wilt Thou bring me?
|  [10:10] Didst Thou not pour me out like milk,
|    And curdle me after like cheese,
|  [10:11] Clothe me with skin and with flesh,
|    And knit me with bones and with sinews?
|  [10:12] Life Thou didst grant me and favour,
|    Thy Providence guarded my spirit;
|  [10:13] While this was Thy secret heart,
|    And this was Thy purpose, I know.
|  [10:14] Do I sin? Then Thou dost observe me,
|    And refuse to acquit me of guilt.
|  [10:15] Am I wicked? Then woe us me.
|    Just? I dare not lift up my head–
|    Full of shame and drunken with sorrow.
|  [10:16] If I rise, like a lion Thou huntest me,
|    Working fresh marvels upon me,
|    [10:17] And bringing new witness against me.
|  Thine anger with me Thou increasest,
|    Thou musterest fresh hosts against me.
|  [10:18] O why from the womb didst Thou bring me?
|    O why died I not all unseen?
|  [10:19] O to be as though I had not been,
|    Borne from the womb to the grave!
|  [10:20] Are the days of my life not few?
|    O leave me to smile a little,
|  [10:21] Ere I go to return no more,
|    To the land of darkness and gloom,
|  [10:22] To the land of murky darkness,
|    Of gloom and utter confusion,
|    Where the very light is as darkness."

#### Zophar’s Appeal to the Unsearchable Wisdom ####

 [Job 11] 

[11:1] Then Zophar of Naamah answered and said:

|  Should a voluble man go unanswered,
|    A man who but babbles be justified?
|  [11:3] Must men hold their peace at thy bragging?
|    Thy mocking is no one to curb?
|  [11:4] Thou maintainest thy way to be pure,
|    And thyself to be clean in His sight.
|  [11:5] But oh that God would speak,
|    And open His lips against thee,
|  [11:6] And show thee the secrets of wisdom–
|    How marvellous are her achievements!
|  For then thou shouldst know that thy guilt
|    God remembers not wholly against thee.
|  [11:7] Canst thou find out the deep things of God,
|    Or come nigh the Almighty’s perfection?
|  [11:8] It is higher than heaven – what canst thou?
|    Deeper than Sheol – what knowest thou?
|  [11:9] Longer than earth is its measure,
|    And broader it is than the sea.
|  [11:10] When He sweeps past and puts men in durance
|    And calls them to trial, who can turn Him?
|  [11:11] For well He knoweth vain men:
|    He looks upon sin and He marks it.
|  [11:12] Even a senseless man may be taught,
|    As a wild ass’s colt may be caught.
|  [11:13] Now, if thou wouldst prepare thy heart,
|    And stretch out thy hands unto Him,
|  [11:14] And put away sin from thy hand,
|    And let wrong dwell no more in thy tent,
|  [11:15] Then thy face thou wouldst lift without blemish,
|    And thou wouldst be steadfast and fearless.
|  [11:16] Yea, thou wouldst forget thy sorrow–
|    As floods that are passed wouldst thou think of it.
|  [11:17] Brighter than noon would thy life rise,
|    Thy darkness would be as the morning.
|  [11:18] Secure wouldst thou be in thy hope:
|    Thou couldst lie without trembling or care–
|  [11:19] Lay thee down without one to affright thee,
|    And many would sue for thy favour.
|  [11:20] But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
|    The place of their refuge is perished.
|    Their hope is – to breathe their last.

#### Job’s Independent Criticism of this World and his Glimpse beyond it ####

 [Job 12] 

[12:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [12:2] Verily ye are the people,
|    And wisdom shall die with you.
|  [12:3] But, like you, I have understanding;
|    Who knoweth not things like these?
|  [12:4] A laughing-stock to his friend
|    Is become one whose cry God had answered.
|  A laughing-stock is the righteous;

[12:The] blameless is doomed to disaster.

|  The man of ease mocks at his fate:
|    There are thrusts for the feet that are slipping.
|  [12:6] It is tents of robbers that prosper,
|    And those who vex God that are safe–
|    Those who say, "Is not God in my hand?"
|  [12:7] But inquire of the beasts – they will teach thee;
|    The birds of the air – they will show thee:
|  [12:8] The creatures that crawl – they will teach thee;
|    The fish of the sea – they will tell thee.
|  [12:9] For which of them all doth not know
|    That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this–
|  [12:10] In whose hand are all living souls
|    And the breath of all humankind?
|  [12:11] Doth not the ear test words
|    As the palate tastes food for itself?
|  [12:12] Doth wisdom depend upon years,
|    Understanding on length of days?
|  [12:13] With Him is wisdom and might,
|    Understanding and counsel are His.
|  [12:14] See! He breaketh down, and who buildeth?
|    Imprisons, and none can set free.
|  [12:15] See! He holds back the floods and they dry;
|    Then He hurls them on earth and confounds it.
|  [12:16] With Him is strength and achievement;
|    Deceived and deceiver are His.
|  [12:17] The wise men of earth He makes foolish;
|    The judges He turns into madmen.
|  [12:18] The fetters kings rivet He loosens,
|    And binds their own loins with a chain.
|  [12:19] He leadeth priests barefoot away;
|    Ancient families He overturneth.
|  [12:20] He removeth the speech of the trusty;
|    The elders He robs of discretion.
|  [12:21] He poureth contempt upon princes;
|    He looseth the belt of the strong.
|  [12:22] He revealeth the deep things of darkness,
|    The gloom-wrapped He bringeth to light.
|  [12:23] He makes nations great and destroys them;
|    Expands them, then hurls them to ruin.
|  [12:24] Earth’s chiefs He bereaves of their judgment;
|    They wander in trackles wastes,
|  [12:25] Where they grope in the unit darkness,
|    And stagger like drunken men.

 [Job 13] 

|  [13:1] Lo! all this mine eye hath seen,
|    Mine ear hath heard it and marked it.
|  [13:2] What ye know, that I know too;
|    I am not one whit behind you.
|  [13:3] But I would address the Almighty–
|    With God I am longing to reason:
|  [13:4] For ye are smearers of lies,
|    Good-for-nothing physicians-each man of you.
|  [13:5] O that ye were but silent–
|    Then might ye be counted as wise.
|  [13:6] Now listen to this mine indictment,
|    Attend to the plea of my lips.
|  [13:7] Is it God that ye utter your lies for?
|    Do ye speak you deceit for him?
|  [13:8] And to Him would ye show your favour?
|    And God’s is the cause ye would plead?
|  [13:9] Were it well if He searched you out?
|    Can ye mock Him as men are mocked?
|  [13:10] For He will punish you sore,
|    If ye secretly show Him your favour.
|  [13:11] Shall His majesty not make you shudder?
|    Shall the dread of Him not full upon you?
|  [13:12] Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
|    Your bulwarks are bulwarks of clay.
|  [13:13] Be still, let me be: I will speak–
|    Then upon me come what may.
|  [13:14] I will take my flesh in my teeth;
|    I will put my life in my hand.
|  [13:15] See! He slays me, I cannot endure;
|    But my ways will I defend to His face:
|  [13:16] And this, also, shall be my salvation,
|    That a hypocrite dare not approach Him.
|  [13:17] Hear now my speech with attention,
|    As I declare in your ears.
|  [13:18] Attend as I set forth my case;
|    I know that the right is with me.
|  [13:19] And if any disputeth against me,
|    Then I would be silent and die.
|  [13:20] But two things alone do not unto me,
|    Then I will not hide from Thy face.
|  [13:21] Lift the weight of Thy hand from off me,
|    And let not Thy terrors appal me:
|  [13:22] Then call Thou, and I will answer;
|    Or let me speak, and answer Thou me.
|  [13:23] How great is my guilt and transgressions?
|    Acquaint me with my sin.
|  [13:24] O why dost Thou hide Thy face,
|    And count me as Thine enemy?
|  [13:25] Wilt Thou harass a leaf that is tossed?
|    Wilt Thou chase the withered stubble,
|  [13:26] That Thou passest a judgment so bitter,
|    Entailing upon me the sins of my youth?
|  [13:27] Thou dost fasten a block on my feet,
|    And set watch over all my ways.
|  Round my roots Thou cuttest a line,

 [Job 14] 

|  [14:5c] Setting bounds tha they may not pass;

 [Job 13] 

|  [13:28] While man doth waste with decay,
|    Like a garment devoured of the moth.

 [Job 14] 

|  [14:1] Man that is born of a woman
|    Is of few days and filled with trouble.
|  [14:2] He comes forth like a flower and he withers;
|    He flees like a shadow and stays not.
|  [14:3] On such dost Thou open Thine eyes?
|    And him wouldst Thou bring to Thy judgment?
|  [14:4] Who can bring from the unclean the clean?
|    Not one is free from sin.
|  [14:5a] Seeing, then, that his days are decreed,
|    [14:5b] And the tale of his months is with Thee,
|  [14:6] Look away, and let him have peace,
|    To enjoy like a hireling his day.
|  [14:7] For hope there may be for a tree:
|    Though cut down, it may sprout once again,
|    And the shoots there from need to fail.
|  [14:8] Though its root in the earth wax old,
|    And its stem be dead in the ground,
|  [14:9] It may bud at the scent of water,
|    And put forth boughs like a plant.
|  [14:10] But the strong man dies and lies prostrate;
|    Man breathes his last and where is he?
|  [14:11] Like the floods of a vanished sea,
|    Like a river dry and withered–
|  [14:12b] Till the heavens be no more, he awakes not,
|    [14:12c] Nor ever is roused from his sleep.
|  [14:13] O wouldst Thou but hide me in Sheol
|    Out of sight, till Thine anger be past,
|  And then call me to mind in Thine own set time!

[14:14] If a dead man may live once again,

|  I could wait all the days of my warfare
|    Until my release shoud come.
|  [14:15] Thou shouldst call, and I would answer:
|    Thou wouldst year for the work of Thy hands.
|  [14:16] But now Thou countest my steps,
|    And passest not over my sin.
|  [14:17] My transgressions is sealed in a bag;
|    Thou hast fastened secure mine iniquity.
|  [14:18] But the very hills crumble to pieces,
|    The rocks are moved out of their place;
|  [14:19] Water wears stone to dust,
|    The floods wash the soil away:
|  So the hope of man Thou destroyest;

[14:12a] He lieth, to rise up no more.

|  [14:20] Thou dost worst him for ever; he passeth,
|    Dismissed – with his face how changed!
|  [14:21] Honour comes to his sons, but he knows not:
|    Or shame, but he doth not perceive it.
|  [14:22] But the flesh upon him feels pain,
|    And the soul within him is sorrowful.

##### ACT II #####

#### Eliphaz’s Appeal to the Unadulterated Doctrine of the Past ####

 [Job 15] 

[15:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

|  [15:2] Would a wise man pour forth windy answers
|    Or fill with the east wind his breast?
|  [15:3] Would he reason with profitless words
|    And with speech that is all unavailing?
|  [15:4] See! thou art destroying religion,
|    Disturbing devout contemplation.
|  [15:5] Thy guilt instructeth thy mouth,
|    And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
|  [15:6] Thine own mouth condems thee – not I,
|    And thine own lips are witness against thee.
|  [15:7] Wast thou the first man to be born?
|    Wast thou fashioned before the hills?
|  [15:8] Wast thou one of the heavenly council?
|    Was wisdom revealed unto thee?
|  [15:9] What knowest thou that we know not?
|    What insight is thine and not ours?
|  [15:10] With us are the grey and the aged,
|    More mighty in years than thy father.
|  [15:11] Dost thou spurn the divine consolations,
|    The word that dealt with thee so gently?
|  [15:12] How fierce the emotions that sweep thee!
|    And how thou flashest thine eyes,
|  [15:13] As thou turnest thy breath against God
|    Into words from thy rebel lips!
|  [15:14] What is man that he should be clean,
|    Or just – one of woman born?
|  [15:15] See! He putteth no trust in His saints,
|    And the heavens are not clean in His sight:
|  [15:16] How much less one abhorrent and tainted–
|    A man that drinks evil like water!
|  [15:17] Now listen to what I will show thee,
|    The thing I have seen I will tell–
|  [15:18] Even tales that were told by the wise
|    And not hidden from them by their fathers,
|  [15:19] Who had the land all to themselves,
|    When no stranger had yet come among them.
|  [15:20] All his days is the wicked in pain,
|    All the years for the tyrant appointed.
|  [15:21] In his ears is the sound of terrors,
|    In peace comes the spoiler upon him.
|  [15:22] He cannot escape from the darkness
|    And he is reserved for the sword.
|  [15:23] Appointed as food for the vulture–
|    He knows that his doom is at hand.
|  The day of darkness appals him;

[15:24a] Constraint and distress overpower him;

|  [15:25] For he stretched out his hand against God,
|    Played the warrior against the Almighty,
|  [15:26] Running against Him stiff-necked
|    With the thick of the boss of his bucklers,

[15:24b] Like a king prepared for the onset.

|  [15:27] He covered his face with his fat,
|    He set thick folds of flesh on his loins;
|  [15:28] And he dwelt in desolate cities,
|    In houses that none should inhabit.
|  What he has won, others shall capture,

[15:29] His substance shall not endure.
|    On the earth he shall cast no shadow.

|  [15:30b] The fierce heat shall wither his branches,

[15:30c] His fruit shall the wind whirl away.

|  [15:31] Let him not trust his plant when it shoots,
|    For the branch thereof shall be vanity.
|  [15:32] It shall wither before its time,
|    Or ever its fronds become green.
|  [15:33] His grapes he shall shed like the vine,
|    And cast off like the olive his blossom.
|  [15:34] For a barren tribe are the godless;
|    Tents of bribery the fire shall consume.
|  [15:35] Big with mischief, they bring forth sin,
|    And their belly matures with deceit.

#### Job’s Cry to the Witness in Heaven ####

 [Job 16] 

[16:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [16:2] Many things such as these have I heard:
|    Ye are wearisome comforters – all of you.
|  [16:3] Shall windy words have an end?
|    What is it that provokes thee to answer?
|  [16:4] I, too, could speak like you,
|    Were your soul in my soul’s stead.
|  I could weave words together about you,
|    And shake my head at you.
|  [16:5] I could strengthen you with my mouth,
|    And encourage you with lip-comfort.
|  [16:6] To speak is no check to my pain;
|    To keep silence – that easeth me nothing.
|  [16:7] But now He hath wearied and dazed me;
|    My misery seizes upon me.
|  [16:8] It rises for witness against me;
|    My grief testifies to my face.
|  [16:9] In His wrath He hath flung me down torn;
|    He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth.
|  My foes whet their eyes upon me;

[16:10] With open mouth they gape.

|  They insult me with blows on the cheek,
|    Coming on in their masses against me.
|  [16:11] To knaves God has given me up;
|    Into wicked hands He has hurled me.
|  [16:12] I was happy, when He took and shattered me;
|    Grasped my neck, and then dashed me in pieces.
|  He set me up for His target;

[16:13] On all sides His archers beset me.

|  He cleaves through my reins unrelenting;
|    He pours out my gall on the ground.
|  [16:14] One breach after another He makes on me,
|    Rushing at me like a warrior.
|  [16:15] Sackcloth I sewed on my skin,
|    And my horn I have laid in the dust.
|  [16:16] My face is red with weeping,
|    And over mine eye-lids is darkness–
|  [16:17] Though wrong there is none in my hands,
|    And though my prayer be pure.
|  [16:18] O earth! cover not my blood;
|    No rest let there be to my crying.
|  [16:19] Behold, in heaven is my Witness,
|    And I have a Sponsor on high.
|  [16:20] My friends pour their scorn upon me,
|    But my tear-stained eyes look unto God,
|  [16:21] That He plead for a man with God,
|    And for son of man with his Friend.
|  [16:22] For when but a few years come,
|    I shall go whence I shall not return.

 [Job 17] 

|  [17:1] His anger hath ruined my days,
|    And for me is left nought but the grave.
|  [17:2] Delusion is surely my portion;
|    On bitterness tarries mine eye.
|  [17:3] Lay a pledge for me – Thou with Thyself:
|    For who else would strike hands with me?
|  [17:4] For their heart Thou hast hidden from wisdom,
|    And therefore Thou wilt not exalt them.
|  [17:5] One inviteth his friends to a feast,
|    While the eyes of his children are failing.
|  [17:6] Thou has made me the by-word of nations;
|    They look upon me as a monster.
|  [17:7] Mine eye is grown dim for vexation;
|    My members are all as a shadow.
|  [17:11] My days pass away without hope;
|    The desires of my heart are extinguished.
|  [17:12] The night I turn into day,
|    And the light is before me as darkness.
|  [17:13] If I hope, then the grave is my home,
|    And my couch I have spread in the darkness.
|  [17:14] I call to the pit, "My mother";
|    And unto the worm, "My sister."
|  [17:15] Where then were that "hope" of mine?
|    And my happiness who can espy?
|  [17:16] Will it go with me down to the grave?
|    Shall we sink to the dust together?

#### Bildad’s Picture of the Sure and Terrible Doom of the Wicked ####

 [Job 18] 

[18:1] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said:

|  [18:2] When with thou end thy words?
|    Now consider, and we shall speak.
|  [18:3] Why are we counted as breasts,
|    And deemed by thee to be dullards?

 [Job 17] 

|  [17:8] Honest men thrill with horror at this:
|    A pure man is roused by such godlessness.
|  [17:9] But the righteous holds on his way,
|    And the man of clean hands waxes stronger.
|  [17:10a] But turn thee hither and come,

 [Job 18] 

[18:4] Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger.

|  For thy sake shall earth be made desert,
|    Or rock be moved out of its place?
|  [18:5] Nay, the light of the wicked is quenced,
|    And the flame of his fire shall not shine.
|  [18:6] The light in his tent shall be dark,
|    And the lamp o’er his head shall go out.
|  [18:7] His great swinging strides become shortened;
|    His own counsel maketh him stumble.
|  [18:8] His foot is thrust into a net,
|    So that over the net-work ge sprawleth.
|  [18:9] A snare shall take hold of his heel,
|    And a trap shall close tightly upon him.
|  [18:10] A noose lies concealed on the ground,
|    And a trap on his path doth await him.
|  [18:11] On all sides are terrors appalling,
|    Pursuing him close at his heels.
|  [18:12] For him shall misfortune be hungry;
|    Disaster is ready to throw him.
|  [18:13] The pestilence gnaws at his skin,
|    And the first-born of death at his members.
|  [18:14] Then, dragged from his tent in despair,
|    He is marched to the King of Terrors.
|  [18:15] His house shall be haunted by ghosts;
|    On his homestead shall brimstone be scattered.
|  [18:16] His roots shall be dried up beneath,
|    And above shall his branches be withered.
|  [18:17] From earth shall his memory perish;
|    No name shall be his on the streets.
|  [18:18] From the light he is thrust into darkness,
|    And chased right out of the world.
|  [18:19] Of his folk, neither kith nor kin–
|    Where he sojourned, not one is left.
|  [18:20] The west is appalled at his doom,
|    And the east is stricken with horror.
|  [18:21] Yea, such are the homes of the wicked,
|    Of those who care nothing for God.

#### Job’s Sublime Faith in his Future Vindication ####

 [Job 19] 

[19:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [19:2] How long will ye vex my soul
|    And crush me to pieces with words?
|  [19:3] These ten times ye have put me to shame,
|    And set upon me unabashedly.
|  [19:4] Well, be it that I have erred–
|    Mine error abides with myself.
|  [19:5] Or would ye be haughty to me,
|    And insult me with your reproaches?
|  [19:6] Know, then, it is God that hath wronged me,
|    And compassed me round with His net.
|  [19:7] Behold! I cry "Wrong" – but no answer;
|    I call – but justice is none.
|  [19:8] My way He hath fenced round impassably,
|    Darkness He sets on my path.
|  [19:9] He hath stripped my glory from off me,
|    And taken the crown from my head.
|  [19:10] He hath torn me clean down – I am gone:
|    He hath plucked up my hope like a tree.
|  [19:11] He hath kindled His anger against me,
|    And counted me one of His enenmies.
|  [19:12] On come His troops together;
|    They throw up a rampart against me.
|  [19:13] My brethren are gone far from me;
|    My friends have estranged themselves from me.
|  [19:14] My neighbours have ceased to acknowledge me;
|    Guests of my house have forgotten me.
|  [19:15] Maids of mine count me a stranger;
|    An alien am I in their sight.
|  [19:16] To my servant I call, but he answers not,
|    Till with my mouth I entreat him.
|  [19:17] My breath is strange to my wife,
|    And my stench to mine own very children.
|  [19:18] Yea, even young boys despise me,
|    And mock me when I try to rise.
|  [19:19] All mine intimate friends abhor me;
|    The man whom I love turns against me.
|  [19:20] My skin clings to my bones;
|    I escape with my flesh in my teeth.
|  [19:21] Have pity, have pity, my friends;
|    For the hand of God hath touched me.
|  [19:22] Why do ye persecute me like – God,
|    And devour my flesh insatiably?
|  [19:23] O that my words were now written,
|    That they were inscribed in a book,
|  [19:24] That with iron pen and with lead
|    On a rock they were graven for ever.
|  [19:25] I know that there liveth a Champion,
|    Who will one day stand over my dust;
|  [19:26] Yea, Another shall rise as My Witness,
|    And, as Sponsor, shall I behold – God;
|  [19:27] Whom mine eyes shall behold, and no stranger’s.
|    My heart is faint in my bosom.
|  [19:28] But if ye are determined to hunt me,
|    And in me find the root of the matter,
|  [19:29] Then dread ye the sword for yourselves;
|    For wrath shall destroy the ungodly.

#### Zophar’s Warning and Innuendo that Heaven and ####
Earth have already Witnessed against Job

 [Job 20] 

[20:1] Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

|  [20:2] Nay, not so do my thoughts make answer;
|    And therefore my heart is uproused.
|  [20:3] Must I hear thine insulting reproof,
|    While mere breath without sense is thine answer?
|  [20:4] Knowest thou not this from of old,
|    From the time there were men on the earth,
|  [20:5] That the song of the wicked is short,
|    And the hypocrite’s joy but a moment?
|  [20:6] Though his majesty mount on the heavens,
|    And his head reach unto the clouds,
|  [20:7] He shall utterly perish like dung;
|    Those that knew him shall ask, "Where is he?"
|  [20:8] Like a dream he shall fly beyond finding,
|    Dispelled like a vision of night.
|  [20:9] No more shall the eye see that saw him;
|    His place shall behold him no more.
|  [20:10] His sons shall be crushed by privation;
|    His wealth shall his children restore.
|  [20:11] The vigour of youth filled his bones,
|    But within him it shall lie in the dust.
|  [20:12] Though evil be sweet in his mouth,
|    As he keeps it hid under his tongue;
|  [20:13] Though he spare it and let it not go,
|    But still holdeth it back in his mouth;
|  [20:14] Yet his food in his stomach is turned;
|    It is poison of asps within him.
|  [20:15] The wealth that he swallowed he vomits;
|    God easteth it forth from his belly.
|  [20:16] The poison of asps he has sucked,
|    And the tongue of the viper shall slay him.
|  [20:17] No rivers of oil shall he see,
|    No torrents of honey and butter.
|  [20:18] His increasing gain brings him no gladness;
|    His traffickling yields him no joy;
|  [20:19] For he crushed down the gains of the poor,
|    And he plundered the house that he built not.
|  [20:20] His treasures have brought him no peace.
|    And his precious things cannot deliver.
|  [20:21] And since none has escaped his devouring,
|    His own fortune shall not endure.
|  [20:22] Brought to straits in the fullness of plenty,
|    The fell force of trouble assails him.
|  [20:23] He shall let loose His hot wrath against him,
|    And terrors shall rain down upon him.
|  [20:24] As he flees from the weapon of iron,
|    And bronze bow pierces him through.
|  [20:25] The missle comes out at his back,
|    And the glittering point from his gall.
|  Terrors keep coming upon him;

[20:26] Deep darkness is stored up for him.

|  A mysterious fire shall devour him,
|    And ravage those left in his tent.
|  [20:27] The heavens shall reveal his guilt,
|    And the earth shalll rise up against him.
|  [20:28] His house shall be swept by destruction,
|    Accursed in the day of His wrath.
|  [20:29] Such the wicked man’s portion from God,
|    God’s heritage unto the rebel.

#### Job’s Fierce Indicment of the Existing Order ####

 [Job 21] 

[21:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [21:2] Hear now my word with attention:
|    Your consolation be this.
|  [21:3] Suffer me, for I would speak also:
|    Then, when I have spoken, mock on.
|  [21:4] Is it man that I would complain of?
|    And why should I not be impatient?
|  [21:5] Now listen to me; and, in horror,
|    Lay ye your hand on your mouth.
|  [21:6] When I think of it, I am confounded,
|    And shuddering seizeth my flesh.
|  [21:7] Why are wicked men suffered to live,
|    To grow old and wax mighty in power?
|  [21:8] Their seed is established before them,
|    Their offspring in sight of their eyes.
|  [21:9] Their homes are strangers to terror;
|    No rod of God is on them.
|  [21:10] Their bull doth unfailingly gender,
|    Their cow never loses her calf.
|  [21:11] Like a flock they send their young children;
|    Their boys and their girls dance.
|  [21:12] They sing to the timbrel and lyre;
|    At the sound of the pipe they make merry.
|  [21:13] They finish their days in prosperity,
|    And go down to Sheol in peace–
|  [21:14] Though they said unto God, "O leave us,
|    We desire not to know Thy ways.
|  [21:15] Why should we serve the Almighty?
|    And what is the good of prayer?"
|  [21:16] See! their fortune is in their own hand:
|    Nought He cares for the schemes of the wicked.
|  [21:17] How oft is the lamp of the wicked put out?
|    How oft does disaster assail them,
|    Or the pains of His anger lay hold of them?
|  [21:18] How often are they as as the straw before wind,
|    Or like chaff that is stolen by the storm?
|  [21:19] "God stores up his guilt for his children."
|    ("Nay," I reply); "let Him punish
|    The man himself, that he feel it.
|  [21:20] Let his own eyes behold his disaster,
|    Let him drink the wrath of Almighty.
|  [21:21] For what doth he care for his house,
|    When his own tale of months is cut short?"
|  [21:22] Will any teach knowledge to God,
|    Seeing He judgeth (angels) on high?
|  [21:23] One dies with his strength unimpaired,
|    In the heyday of ease and prosperity;
|  [21:24] Filled are his buckets with milk;
|    His bones at the marrow are moistened.
|  [21:25] And one dies with soul embittered,
|    With never a taste of good.
|  [21:26] In the dust they lie down together;
|    The worm covers them both.
|  [21:Behold!] I know your Thoughts
|    And your cruel devices against me,
|  [21:28] In askng, "Where lives now the tyrant?
|    Where now doth the godless dwell?"
|  [21:29] Have ye never asked those that travel?
|    Have ye never noted their proofs
|  [21:30] That the wicked is kept from disaster,
|    Is saved in the day of wrath?
|  [21:31] Who tells him his way to his face,
|    Or requites him for what he hath done?
|  [21:32] And yet he is borne to the grave,
|    And men keep watch over his tomb.
|  [21:33] Sweet for him are the clods of the valley,
|    And after him all men draw.
|  [21:34] Why then offer your idle comfort?
|    Your answers leave nothing but falsehood

##### ACT III #####

#### Eliphaz’s Cruel and Baseless Charges ####

 [Job 22] 

[22:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said

|  [22:2] Can a man bring profit to God?
|    Nay, the wise man but profits himself
|  [22:3] Doth Almighty God care for thy righteousness?
|    Hath He gain from thy blameless ways?
|  [22:4] For thy piety would He chastise thee,
|    Or enter with thee into judgment?
|  [22:5] Is not thy wickedness great?
|    Are not thine iniquities endless?
|  [22:6] Thou hast wrongly taken pledge of thy brother,
|    And stripped from the naked their clothing.
|  [22:7] No water thou gavest the weary,
|    And bread thou hast held from the hungry.
|  [22:8] The land was for him that was strong,
|    And the man of rank made it his own.
|  [22:9] Thou has sent widows empty away,
|    Orphan arms thou hast broken in pieces:
|  [22:10] And therfore are snares round about thee,
|    And fear on a sudden confounds thee.
|  [22:11] Thy light is vanished in darkness,
|    And floods of waters are over thee.
|  [22:12] Is not God in the heights of heaven?
|    And the tops of the high stars He seeth.
|  [22:13] Yet thou sayest, "What doth God know?
|    Can He judge aright through the thick darkness?
|  [22:14] The clouds hide Him, so that He sees not;
|    He walketh the vault of the heavens."
|  [22:15] Wilt thou keep to the ancient way,
|    Which men of sin have trodden,
|  [22:16] Who untimely were snatched away.
|    While the ground beneath ran like a stream?
|  [22:19] The righteous rejoiced at the sight,
|    And the innocent laughed them to scorn.
|  [22:20] "Ah! surely our foes are cut off,
|    And the remnant devoured by the fire."
|  [22:21] Now be friendly with Him and submissive,
|    For this is the way to happiness.
|  [22:22] Acccept from His mouth instruction,
|    And lay up His words in thy heart.
|  [22:23] If thou humbly turn to Almighty,
|    And put away sin from thy tent,
|  [22:24] And lay in the dust thy treasure,
|    Ophir gold among stones of the brook,
|  [22:25] That Almighty become thy treasure,
|    And His instruction thy silver,
|  [22:26] Then Almighty shall be thy delight,
|    Thou shalt lift up thy face unto God.
|  [22:27] He will hearken unto thy petition,
|    And so shalt thou pay thy vows.
|  [22:28] The thing thou decreest shall stand,
|    And light shall shine on thy ways.
|  [22:29] For He humbles the high and the proud;
|    But whose eyes are lowly He saveth.
|  [22:30] The innocent man He delivers,
|    And saves for this cleanness of hands.

#### Job’s Second Sustained Indictment of the Existing Order ####

 [Job 23] 

[23:1] The Job answered and said:

|  [23:2] This day also my plaint must be bitter;
|    His hand on my groaning lies heavy.
|  [23:3] O that I knew where to find Him,
|    That I might come unto His throne,
|  [23:4] And set forth my cause before Him,
|    With arguments filling my mouth!
|  [23:5] I would know with what words He would answer,
|    And understand what He would say to me.
|  [23:6] Would He use His great power in the contest?
|    Nay, He would give heed unto me.
|  [23:7] There the upright might argue with Him,
|    And my right I should rescue for ever.
|  [23:8] Behold, I go east, but He is not:
|    And west, but I cannot perceive Him.
|  [23:9] Seek on the north, but in vain:
|    I turn south, but I cannot behold Him.
|  [23:10] But He knoweth the way that is mine;
|    I would come forth as gold, should He try me.
|  [23:11] My foot hath held fast to His steps,
|    And His way have I kept without swerving.
|  [23:12] Not once have I strayed from His precepts;
|    His words have I hid in my bosom.
|  [23:13] But when He hath resolved – who can turn Him?
|    And what He desireth, He doeth.
|  [23:15] For this cause His presence confounds me,
|    The thought of Him fills me with terror;
|  [23:16] For God hath weakened my heart,
|    And Almighty confounded me clean.
|  [23:17] I am utterly lost in the darkness,
|    And gloom enwrappeth my face.

 [Job 24] 

|  [24:1] Why doth God not fix seasons for judgment,
|    And His friends never see His (great) day?
|  [24:2] The wicked remove the landmarks,
|    They plunder the flock with the shepherd.
|  [24:3] They drive off the ass of the fatherless,
|    Take the ox of the widow in pledge.
|  [24:4] The poor they turn out of the way,
|    And the needy must huddle together.
|  [24:5] See! like the wild asss in the desert,
|    They roam forth in search of prey;
|    Their children eat bread of the jungle.
|  [24:6] They reap the fields in the night-time;
|    They punder the vines of the wealthy.
|  [24:7] All night they lie bare, without clothing,
|    With nothing to keep out of the cold.
|  [24:8] They are wet with the showers of the hills,
|    And the rocks they embrace for a shelter.
|  [24:9] The fatherless they tear from the breast,
|    And the babe of the poor take in pledge.
|  [24:10] They go about bare, without clothing,
|    And, hungry, they pilfer the sheaves.
|  [24:11] They press out the oil ’twixt the olive-rows;
|    The wine-vats they tread and then drain.
|  [24:12] From cities and homes they are driven;
|    Their little ones cry out for hunger,
|    But God takes no heed of the wrong.
|  [24:13] There are those who rebel against light,
|    Who recognise not His ways,
|    But refuse to abide in His paths.
|  [24:14] In the evening the murderer rises
|    To butcher the poor and the needy.
|    The thief stalks abroad in the night.
|  [24:15] With face muffed up in a veil,
|    The adulterer watches for twilight,
|    Assured that no eye can behold him.
|  [24:16] In the darkness they break into houses;
|    They shut themselves up in the day-time;
|    For all of them hate the light.
|  [24:17] Familiar with gloomy ways,
|    They seek for themselves the deep darkness,
|  [24:18] And swiftly they glide on the waters.
|  His portion of land shall be cursed,

[24:19] Consumed by the drought and the heat,
|    And flooded away by snow-water.

|  [24:20] The streets of his place shall forget him,
|    Shall think of his greatness no more:
|    Like a dead tree shall he be uprooted.
|  [24:21] For he did not good to the widow,
|    No pity he showed to her babe;

[24:22] And his power swept the helpless away.
|    Vengeance falls: he expects not to live,

[24:23] He is hurled beyond hope of recovery;
|    The tormentor is on his way.

|  [24:24] His greatness is brief – he is gone;
|    Like the mallow he bends, he shrivels–
|    Cut down like the top ears of corn.
|  [24:25] And if not, who will prove me a liar,
|    And reduce mine indictment to nothing?

#### Bildad’s Declaration of God’s Wisdom and Power ####

 [Job 25] 

[25:1] Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

 [Job 26] 

|  [26:2] How well thou hast aided the weak
|    And supported the arm of the strengtless!
|  [26:3] How well thou hast conselled the foolish,
|    And shown thine abundance of wisdom!
|  [26:4] Who inspired thee to utter such words,
|    And whose spirit is it that comes forth from thee?

 [Job 25] 

|  [25:2] Dominion and fear are with Him.
|    On His high places He maketh peace.
|  [25:3] His hosts – are they not beyond counting?
|    Whom doth not His ambush surprise?
|  [25:4] How can man then be just before God?
|    How can one born of woman be pure?
|  [25:5] See! the moon herself is not clear,
|    And the stars are not pure in His sight:
|  [25:6] How much less is man – a mere maggot;
|    And the on of man – but a worm!

 [Job 26] 

|  [26:5] Before Him in pain writhe the giants,
|    Whose home is beneath the waters.
|  [26:6] Sheol is naked before Him,
|    Uncovered lieth Abaddon.
|  [26:7] He stretcheth the North o’er the void,
|    And He hangeth the earth over nothing.
|  [26:8] In His thick clouds He tieth the waters,
|    Yet the clouds are not torn with the weight.
|  [26:9] He closeth the face of His throne,
|    And over it spreadeth His cloud.
|  [26:10] A circle He drew on the deep,
|    To the confines of light and of darkness.
|  [26:11] The pillars of heaven fell a-rocking,
|    Astonished at His rebuke.
|  [26:12] By His power He stirred up the sea,
|    By His wisdom He smote clean through Rahab.
|  [26:13] His breath made the heavens fair;
|    His hand pierced the serpent that fleeth.
|  [26:14] See! these are the fringe of His ways;
|    Yea, ’tis only whisper we hear:
|    Who can tell how mighty His thunder?

#### The Last Clash – Between Job and Zophar ####

##### Job #####

 [Job 27] 

[27:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [27:2] As God Almighty liveth,
|    Who hath wronged and embittered my soul–
|  [27:3] For within me my life is yet whole,
|    And the spirit of God in my nostrils–
|  [27:4] I swear that my lips speak no falsehood,
|    My tongue doth not utter deceit.
|  [27:5] God forbid I shoud grant ye were right;
|    I will cling to mine innocence till I die.
|  [27:6] I maintain to the end I am guiltless;
|    Not an hour of my life do I blush for.
|  [27:12] Ye have all with your own eyes seen it:
|    Wherefore, then, this idle folly?

##### Zophar #####

|  [27:7] Perish my foe like the wicked,
|    Mine enemy as the unrighteous.
|  [27:8] For what is the hope of the godless,
|    When God requireth his soul?
|  [27:9] Will God give ear to his cry,
|    In the day when distress comes upon him?
|  [27:10] Will Almighty be then his delight?
|    When he calleth, will God be entreated?
|  [27:11] I will teach you how God wields His arm,
|    And not hide the Almighty’s behaviour.
|  [27:13] The wicked man’s portion from God is this,
|    And the lot the Almighty bestows on the tyrant:
|  [27:14] If his children grow up, the sword claims them;
|    His offspring are stinted for bread.
|  [27:15] By death shall his remnant be buried,
|    Their widows shall make no lament.
|  [27:16] Though silver he heap up like dust,
|    And prepare (costly) raiment like clay,
|  [27:17] Yet the just shall put on what he stored,
|    And the silver shall fall to the innocent.
|  [27:18] Like a spider’s the house which he builded,
|    Like booth which the vine-keeper maketh.
|  [27:19] He lieth down rich, but he wakes not;
|    He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
|  [27:20] He is caught in a flood of terrors;
|    In the night he is stolen by a tempest.
|  [27:21] The east wind bears him away;
|    It sweepeth him out of his place.
|  [27:22] He hurleth at him without mercy;
|    Fain would he escape from His hand.
|  [27:23] His hands He clappeth at him,
|    And He hisseth at him from His place.

#### Job’s Great Defence and His Last Appeal ####

##### The Happy Past #####

 [Job 29] 

[29:1] Then Job answered and said:

|  [29:2] O to be as in months long gone,
|    As in days when God used to keep me,
|  [29:3] When His lamp shone over my head,
|    And I walked by His light through the darkness;
|  [29:4] As I was in the days of mine autumn,
|    When God protected my tent,
|  [29:5] While still the Almighty was with me,
|    And my children were round about me;
|  [29:6] When my steps were bathed in milk,
|    And the rock poured me rivers of oil!
|  [29:7] When I went to the city gate,
|    Or took up my place in the open,
|  [29:8] The youths, when they saw me, hid.
|    The old men rose and stood.
|  [29:9] Princes refrained from speech,
|    And laid their hand on their mouth.
|  [29:10] The voice of the nobles was hushed,
|    And their tongue would cleave to their palate.
|  [29:21] They hearkened to me and they waited,
|    Kept silence till I should give counsel;
|  [29:22] After I spoke, they spake not again,
|    My speech fell like rain-drops upon them,
|  [29:23] They waited for me as for rain–
|    Open-mouthed, as for latter rain.
|  [29:24] When I smiled upon them, they were strengthened;
|    The light of my face cheered the sorrowing.
|  [29:25] I chose out their way and sat chief,
|    Enthroned like a king in his army.
|  [29:11] I was blessed by the ear that heard me,
|    The eye bore me witness that saw me;
|  [29:12] For I rescued the poor when he cried,
|    The fatherless and the helpless.
|  [29:13] The wretched gave me their blessing,
|    The widow’s heart I made sing.
|  [29:14] I put on the garment of righteousness,
|    A robe and a turban of justice.
|  [29:15] Eyes was I to the blind,
|    Feet to the lame was I;
|  [29:16] A father was I to the poor,
|    And I searched out the cause of the stranger.
|  [29:17] I shattered the jaws of the wicked,
|    And hurled the prey from his teeth.
|  [29:18] So I thought, "I shall die with my nest,
|    As the sand my days shall be many.
|  [29:19] My root is spread out to the waters,
|    All night lies the dew on my branches.
|  [29:20] Within me my glory is fresh,
|    And my bow is renewed in my hand."

##### The Awful Present #####

 [Job 30] 

|  [30:9] But now am I become their song,
|    Yea, I am a by-word among them.
|  [30:10] In horror they stand far aloof,
|    And they spare not to spit at the sight of me.
|  [30:11] He hath slackened my bow-string, and humbled me,
|    Flung down my banner before me.
|  [30:12] Against me His hosts stand up,
|    They raise deadly ramparts against me.
|  [30:13] My path they tear up clean,
|    My tracks they destroy altogether.
|  His Archers ring me around,

[30:14] As through a wide breach they come in,
|    Rolling on in the midst of the ruin.

[30:15] Terrors are turned upon me;

|  My weal is the sport of the winds,
|    And my welfare is passed like a cloud.
|  [30:16] And now is my soul poured out,
|    The terrors of misery seize me.
|  [30:17] The night boreth into my bones,
|    And the pains that gnaw never slumber,
|  [30:18] From sore wasting my garments is shrunk;
|    It clingeth to me like my vest.
|  [30:19] (God) hath plunged me into the mire,
|    So that I am like dust and ashes.
|  [30:20] I cry, but Thou givest no answer;
|    Thou standest and heedest me not.
|  [30:21] Cruel to me art Thou turned;
|    With the might of Thy hand Thou dost scourge me.
|  [30:22] Thou settest me to ride on the wind,
|    And I melt in the roar of the storm.
|  [30:23] For I know Thou wilt bring me to death,
|    To the house where all living assemble.
|  [30:24] Yet sinking men stretch out their hand,
|    And cry for help as they perish.
|  [30:25] He whose days are hard – does he weep not?
|    Is the soul of the needy not grieved?
|  [30:26] For instead of the good I had hoped for came evil,
|    Instead of the light I waited came darkness.
|  [30:27] My heart is hot and restless,
|    And misery daily confronts me.
|  [30:28] I got with my sorrow uncomforted,
|    Standing where jackals are gathered.
|  [30:29] Brother am I to the wolves,
|    And of ostriches the companion.
|  [30:30] All backened my skin peels from off me;
|    My bones are burned with the heat.
|  [30:31] So my lyre is turned into mourning,
|    My pipe to the voice of lament.

##### The Defence and Final Appeal #####

 [Job 31] 

|  [31:1] A tyrst I made with mine eyes
|    To give no heed unto folly.
|  [31:2] For how doth the high God reward it–
|    The Almighty in heaven requite it?
|  [31:3] Is not for the wicked misfortune–
|    Disaster for workers of wrong?
|  [31:4] Doth He not see my ways,
|    And number my steps every one?
|  [31:5] If ever I walked with falsehood,
|    Or my foot hath made haste unto fraud–
|  [31:6] Let God only weigh wish just balance,
|    Mine innocence He must acknowledge–
|  [31:7] If my step ever swerved from the way.
|    Or my heart hath gone after mine eyes,
|    Or spot hath cleaved to my hands,
|  [31:8] Then what I sow may others enjoy,
|    And all produce of mine be uprooted.
|  [31:9] If my heart hath been lured by a woman,
|    If I lurked at my neighbour’s door,
|  [31:10] May my own wife grind to another,
|    And let others bow down upon her.
|  [31:11] For that were an infamous crime,
|    An iniquity calling for judgment,
|  [31:12] A fire that devours to Abaddon
|    And would all mine increase consume.
|  [31:13] Never spurned I the cause of my servant–
|    Of man or of maid – when we strove.
|  [31:15] Did not He that made me make him,
|    Did not One fashion us in the womb?
|  [31:16] Ne’er denied I the wish of the poor,
|    Nor brought grief to the eyes of the widow.
|  [31:17] Never ate I my morsel alone,
|    Without sharing thereof with the orphan.
|  [31:14] Else what should I do, when God rose?
|    When He visited, what should I answer?
|  [31:18] For father-like, He brought me up from my youth,
|    And my Guide has He been from my mother’s womb.
|  [31:19] Never saw I one naked and perishing–
|    Needy, with nothing to cover him–
|  [31:20] But I warmed him with fleece from my lambs,
|    And his loins gave me their blessing.
|  [31:21] If, beacause I saw help in the gate,
|    I have ever set hand on the innocent,
|  [31:22] Let my shoulder fall from its blade,
|    And mine arm from the socketh be broken.
|  [31:24] Never set I my trust upon gold,
|    Nor called the fine gold my confidence.
|  [31:25] Mine abundant wealth never elated me,
|    Nor all that my hands had gotten.
|  [31:26] Never, watching the shining lights,
|    Or the moon as she walked in her splendour,
|  [31:27] Did my heart feel their subtle allurement,
|    Or my hand throw a kiss to my mouth.
|  [31:28] This, too, were a crime for the judges,
|    For to God above I had lied:
|  [31:23] The terrors of God would assail me,
|    Before whose approach I were powerless.
|  [31:29] Ne’er rejoiced I at enemy’s fall,
|    Nor triumphed when evil befel him;
|  [31:30] Not suffered my mouth to sin,
|    By demanding his life in a curse.
|  [31:31] The men of my tent will declare
|    None has ever been stinted of food.
|  [31:32] Not a stranger e’er lodged in the street,
|    For I opened my doors to the wayfarer.
|  [31:38] If my land ever cried out against me,
|    Her furrows all weeping together;
|  [31:39] If her strength I have drained without cost,
|    Or have poured out the life of her owner;
|  [31:40] Let thorns take the place of wheat,
|    And foul-smelling weeds – of barley.
|  [31:33] No fear of the crowd ever led me
|    To hide my sin among men.
|  [31:34] No contempt of the clans ever scared me
|    To stay behind closed doors in silence.
|  [31:35] O for One who would listen to me.
|    Behold! there is my cross!
|    Let Almighty God give me His answer.
|  O would that I had the indicment
|    Mine Adversary hath written!
|  [31:36] For, bearing it high on my shoulder,
|    And winding it round like a crown,
|  [31:37] Every step of my life I would tell Him,
|    Like a prince I would enter His presence.
|  [31:40c] The words of Job are ended.

#### The Answer of the Almighty ####

##### The wonders of the Inanimate World #####

 [Job 38] 

[38:1] Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwindand said:

|  [38:2] who is this, then, that darkeneth counsel
|    By words that are empty of knowledge?
|  [38:3] Gird up they loins like a man:
|    I would ask of thee – do thou enlighten Me.
|  [38:4] Where wast thou, when I founded the earth?
|    Declare out of the depths of thine insight.
|  [38:5] Dost thou of know who appointed her measures,
|    Or who stretched upon her the line?
|  [38:6] Whereupon were her pedestal sunk,
|    Or who laid her corner-stone,
|  [38:7] When the morning-stars sang together,
|    And the sons of God shouted in chorus?
|  [38:8] Who shut in the sea with doors,
|    When it burst its way out of the womb–
|  [38:9] When gave it its robe of cloud,
|    And its swaddling band of the dark cloud;
|  [38:10] When I broke off its border for it,
|    And set on its bars and doors,
|  [38:11] Declaring, "Thus far, but no further,
|    And here shall thy proud waves be stayed"?
|  [38:12] Didst thou ever give charge to the morning,
|    Or appoint to the day-star her place,
|  [38:13] To take hold of the skirts of the earth,
|    And to shake out the wicked from off it?
|  [38:14] It is changed as clay under the seal,
|    And the world stands forth (bright) as a garment.
|  [38:16] Hast thou entered the springs of the ocean,
|    Or walked in the depths of the sea?
|  [38:17] Have the gate-ways of Death been unveiled to thee?
|    Hast thou looked on the porters of Hades?
|  [38:18] The breadth of the earth hast thou noted?
|    How great is it? Tell, if thou knowest.
|  [38:19] Which way leads to the home of the light?
|    And where is the place of the darkness?
|  [38:20] Canst thou fetch it out unto its border,
|    Or lead it back home to its house?
|  [38:21] Thou wast born then, so doubtless thou knowest–
|    The tale of thy years is so great!
|  [38:22] Hast thou entered the store-house of snow?
|    Hast thou looked on the guardians of hail,
|  [38:23] Which I hoard for the time of distress,
|    for the day of assault and of battle?
|  [38:24] Which way are the vapours divided,
|    That scatter on earth the cool water?
|  [38:25] Who cleft for the torrents a channel,
|    A path for the flash of the lightning–
|  [38:26] Sending rain on the desolate land,
|    On the uninhabited desert,
|  [38:27] Thus gladdening the wilderness waste,
|    And the thirsty land clothing with verdure?
|  [38:28] Say, hath the rain a father?
|    Or who hath begotten the dew-drops?
|  [38:29] Out of whose womb issued the ice?
|    And the hoar-frost of heaven – who hath borne it?
|  [38:30] The waters are frozen like stone,
|    And the face of the deep remains hidden.
|  [38:31] Dost thou fasten the chain of the dog-star
|    Or loosen the bonds or Orion?
|  [38:32] Dost thou bring out the stars in their season?
|    The Bear with her young dost thou lead?
|  [38:33] Dost thou lay down the law to the heavens,
|    Or establish their rule in the earth?
|  [38:34] Dost thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
|    That abundance of waters obey thee?
|  [38:35] Dost thou send on their mission the lightnings?
|    To thee do they say, "Here we are"?
|  [38:36] Who hath set in the fleecy clouds wisdom?
|    Or given to the meteor insight?
|  [38:37] Who spreadeth the clouds out in wisdom?
|    Who tilteth the pitchers of heaven,
|  [38:38] When the dust runneth into a mass
|    And the clods cleave firmly together?

#### The Wonders of the Animate World ####

|  [38:39] Dost thou hunt for the lion his prey
|    Or the young lions’ craving appease,
|  [38:40] When low in their lairs they crouch,
|    Lying in wait in the thicket?
|  [38:41] Who provideth at even his food,
|    When his young ones cry unto God,
|    Open-mouthed, for the meat that is lacking?

 [Job 39] 

|  [39:1] Dost thou fix the birth-times of the wild goats,
|    Or watch o’er the calving of hinds?
|  [39:2] Dost thou number the months they fulfil,
|    Or determine the time of their bearing?
|  [39:3] They cower and bring forth their young,
|    Swiftly ridding themselves of their birth-pangs.
|  [39:4] Their young one grow strong in the open,
|    Go forth and come back not again.
|  [39:5] Who let out the wild ass free?
|    Who loosened the bonds of the wild ass,
|  [39:6] Whose home I have made the steppe,
|    And the salt-land the place of his dwelling?
|  [39:7] He laughs at the din of the city,
|    No driver roars in his ears.
|  [39:8] The mountains he scours as his pasture,
|    And every green thing is his quest.
|  [39:9] Will the wild ox be willing to serve thee,
|    Or spend the night in thy crib?
|  [39:10] Wilt thou fasten a rope on his neck?
|    Will he harrow thy furrows behind thee?
|  [39:11] Wilt thou trust his magnificent strength,
|    Or put him in charge of thy labours,
|  [39:12] Expect him to come again
|    And gather thy seed to thy threshing-floor?
|  [39:13] The wing of the ostrich beats joyously,
|    But her pinions and feathers are cruel.
|  [39:14] For she trusteth her eggs to the ground,
|    And she setteth them down in the dust,
|  [39:15] Forgetting that foot may crush them,
|    Or beast of the field tread upon them.
|  [39:16] Her young she treats harshly, as strangers,
|    Unmoved though her toil be in vain.
|  [39:17] For God hath not dealt to her wisdom,
|    Nor alloted to her understanding.
|  [39:18] She scuddeth along in her flight,
|    At the horse and his rider she laugheth.
|  [39:19] Dost thou give to the war-horse his strength,
|    Clothe his neck with the quivering mane?
|  [39:20] Dost thou make him to leap like a locust,
|    With snort that is splendid and terrible?
|  [39:21] He paweth the valley exulting,
|    As forth to the fight the fares.
|  [39:22] He laughs undismayed at the terror,
|    He turneth not back from the sword.
|  [39:23] Against him the quiver may rattle,
|    The glittering spear or the dart:
|  [39:24] He devoureth the ground in wild rage,
|    Without turning to right hand or left.
|  [39:25] At the trumpet alarm he saith "Ha!"
|    For he scenteth the battle afar,
|    The thunder of captains, the shouting.
|  [39:26] Doth the hawk soar aloft by thy wisdom.
|    And spread out her wings to the south?
|  [39:27] Doth the eagle mount up at thy bidding,
|    And make her nest high on the mountains?
|  [39:28] The cliff is her home where she lodges–
|    The peak of the cliff and the fortress,
|  [39:29] She spieth her prey from the heights
|    With those eyes that see from afar.
|  [39:30] Her young ones suck up blood:
|    Where the slain are, there is she.

##### The Rebuke #####

 [Job 40] 

|  [40:2] Shall a caviller strive with Almighty?
|    He that argues with God – let him answer.
|  [40:8] Wilt thou disallow my right.
|    And condemn me that thou mayest be justified?
|  [40:9] Hast thou an arm like God?
|    With a voice like His canst thou thunder?
|  [40:10] Now deck thee with pride and with majesty,
|    Clothe thee with glory and splendour.
|  [40:11] Pour forth the floods of thine anger,
|    And all that is lofty abase.
|  [40:12] Every proud one lay low whom thou seest,
|    And crush thou the wicked beneath thee.
|  [40:13] Hide them together in dust,
|    And bind their faces in darkness.
|  [40:14] And I then will render thee praise
|    That thy right hand hath won thee the victory.

#### Job’s HUmble and Penitent Reply ####

 [Job 40] 

[40:3] Then Job answered Jehovah and said:

|  [40:4] Ah, how small am I! What can I answer?
|    I lay my hand on my mouth.
|  [40:5] Once indeed have I spoken; – enough:
|    Yea twice – but not ever again.

 [Job 42] 

|  [42:2] I acknowledge that Thou hast prevailed;
|    There is nothing too hard for Thee.
|  [42:3b] Therefore spake I without understanding,
|    [42:3c] Of wonders beyond my knowledge.
|  [42:5] I had heard of Thee but by hearsay,
|    But now mine eye hath seen Thee;
|  [42:6] And therefore I spurn (my words)
|    And repent in dust and in ashes.

##### The Epilogue #####

#### The Friends Rebuked ####

 [Job 43] 

[43:7] So after Jehovah has spoken these words to Job,He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My anger ishot against thee and thy two friends; because,unlike my servant Job, ye have not spoken the[43:8] truth about me. But now, go to my servant Jobwith seven bullocks and seven rams, and offer themas a burnt-offering for yourselves, and my servantJob shall pray for you; for, our of regard for him,I will not put you to confusion for your failure tospeak the truth about me, as my servant Job has[43:9] done." So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad theShuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and didas Jehovah told them, and Jehovah had regard untoJob.

#### The Restoration of Job ####

[43:10] So when Job prayed for his friends, Jehovahchanged his fortunes, giving him double of all he[43:11] had before. Then his brothers and sister and oldfriends came – every one of them – and dinedwith him at his home; and they condoled withhim, and comforted him for all the misery thatJehovah had brought upon him. Besides, each ofthem made him a present of a piece of money and agold ring.[43:12] Thus in the end Jehovah made Job more blessedthan he was at the first – with his fourteen thousandsheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of[43:13] oxen, and one thousand she-asses. Besides, he hadseven sons, and three daughters whom he named[43:14] in the order of their birth Jemimah, Keziah, and[43:15] Keren-happuch. In all the world were no womenfound so fair as the daughters of Job, and theirfather made them sharers in his inheritance withtheir brothers.

[43:16] After this Job lived a hundred and forty years.Thus he was spared to see not only his children, buthis grandchildren – four generations.

[43:17] Then Job died – old and full of days.

##### Elihu’s Interpretation of Suffering #####

 [Job 32] 

[32:1] Now these three men ceased answering Job,because he was righteous in his own eyes. Then[32:2] the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite,of the family of Ram, was kindled; against Jobwas his anger kindled, because he had made himself[32:3] out to be more righteous than God. But his angerwas kindled against his three friends as well,because they had condemned Job without finding[32:4] any answer. Now, as they were older, Elihu had[32:5] waited while they were speaking with Job; but,on seeing that the three men had no answer to offer,Elihu’s anger was kindled.

[32:6] Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buziteanswered and said:I am but young in years,
|    While ye are aged men:

|  So I was timid, and feared
|    To set my opinion before you.
|  [32:7] I felt that days ought to speak,
|    And that years gave the right to teach wisdom.
|  [32:8] But the spririt enlighteneth men,
|    The Almighty inspires then with insight.
|  [32:9] It is not the old men that are wise,
|    Nor the aged that understand truth;
|  [32:10] And so, pray, listen to me–
|    I, too, would set forth my opinion.
|  [32:11a] I waited what you had to say,

[32:11b] I lent mine ear to your reasons;

|  [32:12a] Yea, I gave heed unto you,

[32:11c] While ye searched out what to say.

|  [32:12b] But see! none brought conviction to Job,

[32:12c] Not a man of you answered his words.

|  [32:13] Say not "Here wer have come upon wisdom;
|    ’Tis God must confound him, not man."
|  [32:14] He hath not yet debated with me,
|    Nor will I give him answers like yours.
|  [32:15] Panic-stricken they answer no more,
|    Words have floated away from them.
|  [32:16] Must I wait because they are silent,
|    Stand still, and answer no more?
|  [32:17] Nay, but I, too, will answer my share;
|    I, too, will set forth my opinion.
|  [32:18] For filled with words am I;
|    The breath in my body distress me.
|  [32:19] Like wine without vent is my belly,
|    Like new wine-skins ready to burst.
|  [32:20] I must speak and so find me relief;
|    I must open my lips and make answer.
|  [32:21] I would show my favour to none,
|    And give flattering titles to no man.
|  [32:22] Of flattery I know nothing–
|    Else soon would my Maker remove me.

 [Job 33] 

|  [33:1] But listen, Job, pray, to my words,
|    And give ear unto all that I say.
|  [33:2] Behold! I have opened my mouth;
|    My tongue in my palate hath spoken.
|  [33:3] MY heart poureth forth words of knowledge;
|    Unfeigned is the speech of my lips.
|  [33:5] Then answer me this, if thou canst:
|    Stand up and debate with me.
|  [33:6] See! I am in God’s sight as thou;
|    I, too, was fashioned to clay.
|  [33:4] The spirit of God hath created me;
|    My life is the breath of Almighty.
|  [33:7] See! no terrors of mine need appal thee,
|    Nor shall my hand lie heavy upon thee.
|  [33:8] Thou hast certainly said in my hearing,
|    Thy voice I heard thus maintaining:
|  [33:9] "Pure and sinless am I;
|    I am clean, there is no guilt in me.
|  [33:10] But He findeth pretexts against me,
|    He counteth me as His foe.
|  [33:11] He setteth my feet in the stocks,
|    Keepeth watch over all my ways.
|  [33:12] Behold! when I cry, comes no answer:
|    God hideth Himself from men."

##### God speaks to Men through Dreams and Visions #####

|  [33:13] Now why dost thou plead against Him
|    That He giveth thy words no answer?
|  [33:14] For God hath one manner of speech,
|    Yea two – and He doth not revoke it.
|  [33:15] In a dream, in a vision of night,
|    "When deep sleep falleth on men,"
|    In slumbers upon the bed,
|  [33:16] Then He opens the ears of men,
|    And sendeth them fearful warnings,
|  [33:17] To turn men aside from wrong,
|    And to bring human pride to an end–
|  [33:18] To keep back man’s soul from the pit
|    And his life from descending to Sheol.

##### God speaks to Men through Pain and Sickness #####

|  [33:19] Or on bed of pain he is chastened,
|    And all his bones are benumbed.
|  [33:20] His soul has a loathing of bread,
|    And the daintiest food he abhorreth.
|  [33:21] His flesh is lean and wasted;
|    His bones are all but bare.
|  [33:22] His soul draweth nigh to the pit,
|    And his life to the angels of death.
|  [33:23] Then over him there is an angel
|    Interpreter, one of a thousand,
|  Who expounds unto man his chastisement,

[33:24] Takes pity on him and says:

|  Let him not go down to the pit:
|    I have found (for his soul) a ransom."
|  [33:25] Then his flesh becomes fresher than child’s,
|    He returns to the days of his youth.
|  [33:26] He prays unto God with acceptance,
|    He looks on His face with joy,
|    Tells the story of his salvation,

[33:27] And sings before men this song:

|  "I have sinned and perverted the right,
|    Yet He hath not requited my sin.
|  [33:28] He hath ransomed my soul from the pit,
|    That alive I behold the light."
|  [33:29] See! all these things God doeth,
|    Twice, yea thrice, with a man,
|  [33:30] To bring back his soul from the pit,
|    With the light of life’s sunshine upon him.
|  [33:31] Be attentive, Job, listen to me;
|    Be thou silent, and I will speak.
|  [33:32] If aught thou canst say, then answer me:
|    Speak, for my wish is to clear thee.
|  [33:33] But if not, listen thou unto me:
|    Be silent, while I teach thee wisdom.

 [Job 34] 

[34:1] Then Elihu went on:

|  [34:2] Listen, ye wise, to my words,
|    And give ear to me, ye that have knowledge.
|  [34:3] For the ear is the tester of words
|    As the palate the taster of food.
|  [34:4] Let us choose for ourselves what is good.
|    Recognise by ourselves what is good.
|  [34:5] For Job claimeth to be in the right:
|    "God," he says, "hath deprived me of justice.
|  [34:6] Though right, I am counted a liar;
|    And though sinless, He wounds me past healing."
|  [34:7] Where is the man like Job
|    That drinketh up scorning like water,
|  [34:8] That leagues with the workers of wrong,
|    And that walketh with wicked men?
|  [34:9] For he saith that a mn hath no profit
|    From being the friend of God.

##### God watches over the Moral Order #####

|  [34:10] So, ye men of intelligence, listen.
|  Far be it from God to do evil,
|    And from the Almighty to err.
|  [34:11] For the work of each man He requiteth;
|    He bringeth his way back upon him.
|  [34:12] God assuredly cannot do wrong.
|    The Almighty would not pervert justice.
|  [34:13] Who entrusted the earth to His charge?
|    And who watcheth over the universe?
|  [34:14] If He should recall His spirit
|    And gather His breath to Himself,
|  [34:15] All flesh together would perish,
|    And man would return to the dust.
|  [34:16] If thou art wise, listen to this,
|    And give ear to the sound of my words.
|  [34:17] Could One rule to whom justice were odious?
|    Condemn’st thou the Just and the Mighty One,
|  [34:18] Who saith to a king, "Thou villain!"
|    To nobles, "Ye infamous men!"–
|  [34:19] Who showeth no favour to princes,
|    Regardeth not rich more than poor?
|  For the work of His hands are they all:

[34:20] In a moment they die – at midnight.

|  The rich are convulsed, they pass:
|    He mysteriously removeth the mighty.
|  [34:21] For His eyes are over man’s ways,
|    Every one of his steps He beholdeth.
|  [34:22] No darkness is there and no gloom
|    Where the workers of wrong may be hidden.
|  [34:23] No time doth he set for man
|    To appear before God in judgment:
|  [34:24] He shatters the strong without trial,
|    And others He sets in their place.
|  [34:25] For He giveth heed to their works;
|    In the night He doth overturn them.
|  [34:26] Beneath their crimes they are crushed;
|    He smites them in presence of witnesses;
|  [34:27] For they turned from following Him,
|    And they gave no heed to His ways.
|  [34:28] so the crushed were driven to cry to Him,
|    And the call of the wretched He heard.
|  [34:29] But if He remain silent, who then can condemn Him?
|    If He hide His face, who can bring Him to task?
|  Yet He watches o’er nations and men,

[34:30] That none reigns who would wrong the people.

|  [34:31] Say to God, "I have borne my sin,
|    I will not offend any more.
|  [34:32] Now I see it: O teach me Thyself.
|    Have I sinned? I will do so no more."
|  [34:33] Must He recompense after thy wishes,
|    That thou hast rejected (His ways)?
|  ’Tis for thee to decide – not for me;
|    Then utter the thing that thou knowest.
|  [34:34] Men of intellect will admit–
|    Men of wisdom who listen to me–
|  [34:35] That Job hath not spoken with knowledge,
|    His words are not marked by insight.
|  [34:36] O that Job might be tried to the end
|    For the wickedness of his answers!
|  [34:37] For he addeth rebellion to sin,
|    And multiples words against God.

 [Job 35] 

[35:1] Then Elihu went on:

|  [35:2] Thinkest thou this to be just,
|    Dost thou call it they right before God,
|  [35:3] To ask, "What advantage is mine?
|    What the better am I, if I sin not?"
|  [35:4] Well, I will give thee an answer,
|    And thy three friends as well.
|  [35:5] Look to the heavens and see,
|    And observe the clouds high overhead.
|  [35:6] what effect hath thy sin upon Him?
|    What cares He for thy many transgressions?
|  [35:7] What gain comes to Him from thy righteousness?
|    What receives He from thy hand?
|  [35:8] ’Tis to men like thyself thy sin matters,
|    ’Tis mortals thy righteousness touches.
|  [35:9] Under sore oppression men cry
|    For help from the arm of the tyrant;
|  [35:10] But none saith, "Where is God my Creator?"–
|    The Giver of songs in the night,
|  [35:11] Who grants us more knowledge than beasts,
|    And more wisdom than birds of the air.
|  [35:12] Then they cry, but receive no answer,
|    Because of their impious pride.
|  [35:13] For to idle cries God will not listen,
|    Nor will the Almighty regard them.
|  [35:14] And when He seems not to regard thee,
|    Be still and wait patiently for Him.
|  [35:15] But now that His wrath doth not punish,
|    And sin He not greatly regardeth,
|  [35:16] Job opens his mouth thus idly,
|    And poureth forth words without knowledge.

##### God’s Disciplinary Methods Illustrated in History #####

 [Job 36] 

[36:1] Then Elihu continued:

|  [36:2] Wait, I pray, but a while; I will show thee:
|    I have yet to say somewhat for God.
|  [36:3] With knowledge fetched from afar
|    I will justify my Creator.
|  [36:4] For truly my words are no lie;
|    One in knowledge complete stands before thee.
|  [36:5] Behold, God spurneth the stubborn,

[36:6] The wicked He spareth not:

|  But He granteth the rights of the wretched,

[36:7] Withdraws not their due from the just.

|  It has happened to kings on the throne,
|    seated in pride and glory,
|  [36:8] That prisoners in chains they became,
|    Held fast in the cords of misery:
|  [36:9] Then He set forth before them their doings,
|    Their proud and rebellious behaviour;
|  [36:10] He opened their ears to instruction
|    And bade them turn back from sin.
|  [36:11] If they hearken and do Him homage,
|    They finish their days in prosperity.
|  [36:12] But if stubborn, they pass to Sheol,
|    They die without coming to knowledge.
|  [36:13] For, godless at heart, they grow sullen;
|    They cry not for help when He binds them.
|  [36:14] They die in the days of their youth,
|    Like sodomites they perish.
|  [36:15] The sufferer He saveth through sufferings;
|    Adversity opens his ear.
|  [36:16] But thou hast been lured by thy freedom,
|    By ease at the jaws of distress,
|  By the fat on thy well-filled table,
|    And the absence of trouble to haunt thee.
|  [36:17] The full fate of the wicked is thine;
|    Thou art held in the grasp of His judgment.
|  [36:18] Let not chastisement make thee resentful,
|    Nor let the high ransom deflect thee.
|  [36:19] Wouldst thou marshall thy plaint against Him,
|    And all the resource of thy might?
|  [36:20] Let not folly beguile thee to rival
|    The man who doth think himself wise.
|  [36:21] Beware, and incline not to sin,
|    Nor make choice of sin rather than suffering.

##### God’s Marvellous Ways in Nature #####

|  [36:22] See! God by His power doeth loftily–
|    Who is a teacher like Him?
|  [36:23] Who hath enjoined Him His way?
|    Or who hath said, "Thou doest wrongly"?
|  [36:24] Remember to magnify Him
|    For His work, whereof men have sung.
|  [36:25] All men look with pleasure thereon,
|    Though man seeth it but from afar.
|  [36:26] Behold! God is great beyond knowledge,
|    The tale of His years beyond search.
|  [36:27] For He draweth up drops from the sea,
|    Which He poureth in rain from His Vapour,
|  [36:28] Wherewith, as the clouds distil,
|    They drop down in showers upon men.
|  [36:29] Who can tell how the clouds are spread out,
|    How He thunders from His pavilion?
|  [36:30] He spreadeth His vapour around Him;
|    He covers the tops of the mountains.
|  [36:31] Therewith He sustaineth the nations,
|    And food in abundance He giveth.
|  [36:32] He wrappeth His hands in the lightning,
|    And biddeth it fly to its mark.
|  [36:33] His thunder announces His coming;
|    His anger is kindled at wrong.

 [Job 37] 

|  [37:1] At this doth thy heart not tremble,
|    And leap right out of its place?
|  [37:2] Hark, hark to His voice tempestuous,
|    To the roar that goes forth from His mouth.
|  [37:3] ’Neath the whole sky He letteth it loose,
|    And His flash to the fringe of the world.
|  [37:4] In the wake of it roareth His voice,
|    With His voice majestic He thunders;
|  Nor holds He the lightnings back,
|    Whensoever His voice is heard.
|  [37:5] God letteth us see His wonders;
|    Great things beyond knowledge He doeth.
|  [37:6] For He saith to the snow, "Fall earthwards";
|    Likewise to His strong rushing rain.
|  [37:7] He sealeth up all mankind,
|    That His work may be known of them all.
|  [37:8] The beasts go into their lairs,
|    And within their dens remain.
|  [37:9] The temptest comes out of its chamber,
|    And out of its store-house the cold.
|  [37:10] By the breath of God ice is given,
|    The broad waters lie in constraint.
|  [37:11] Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with hail,
|    And the cloud doth scatter His lightning.
|  [37:12] This way and that is darteth,
|    Turning about by His guidance,
|  Doings whate’er He commands it
|    Over the face of His world,
|  [37:13] Wether for curse and correction
|    Or in mercy He sendeth it forth.
|  [37:14] Hearken to this, Job, stand still,
|    And consider the wonders of God.
|  [37:15] Dost thou know how God doeth His work;
|    How He flashes the light of His cloud?
|  [37:16] Dost thou know how the thick clouds are poised;
|    How He pours down a flood when it thunders,
|  [37:17] What time thy garments grow hot
|    From the south wind which laps earth in silence?
|  [37:18] Like Him canst thou spread out the sky,
|    Like Him canst thou spread out the sky,
|  Which is strong as a molten mirror?
|  [37:19] How then shall we speak to Him? Tell me;
|    For helpless are we in our darkness.
|  [37:20] Shall one cavil at Him when He speaketh?
|    Or shall a man say that He errs?
|  [37:21] Now no man can look on the light,
|    So dazzling bright in the sky,
|  When the wind has passed over and cleared it,

[37:22] And radiance comes out of the north;

|  But the splendour of God – how terrible!

[37:23] The Almighty we cannot find out.

|  Powerful is He and all-righteous,
|    And justice He will not pervert.
|  [37:24] For this cause ought mortals to fear Him:
|    But the heart of conceit He despiseth.

##### The Mystery of the Divine Wisdom #####

##### (As for Wisdom-whence cometh she? #####

 Understanding-where hath she her home?)

|  [37:1] For a mine there is for the silver,
|    And a place where the gold is refined.
|  [37:2] Iron is taken from dust,
|    And copper is smelted from stone.
|  [37:3] Man explores the dark to its limits,
|    Seeks stones fromthe blackest gloom.
|  [37:4] He breaketh a shaft through the ground;
|    Forgotten, they hang without foothold;
|    They swing to and fro far from men.
|  [37:5] From the surface of earth cometh bread,
|    While, beneath, it is raked as by fire.
|  [37:6] Her stones are the home of the sapphire;
|    The dust thereof is gold.
|  [37:9] He puts forth his hand on the rock;
|    At their roots he o’erturneth the mountains.
|  [37:10a] Channels he cuts in the rocks,

[37:11a] And he bindeth the streams that they weep not.

|  [37:10b] Each precious thing his eye seeth;

[37:11b] He bringeth the secret to light.

|  [37:12] But Wisdom – whence cometh she?
|    Understanding – where hath she her home?
|  [37:7] The pathway is strange to the vulture,
|    Unseen by the eye of the hawk,
|  [37:8] By the sons of pride untrodden,
|    Nor ever by fierce lion skirted.
|  [37:13] The way to her no man knoweth;
|    In the land of the living none finds her.
|  [37:14] The deep saith, "She is not in me";
|    And the sea saith, "She is not in me."
|  [37:15] No fine gold for her can be given,
|    Nor silver be paid as her price.
|  [37:16] Not in Ophir gold can she be valued,
|    In precious onyx or sapphire.
|  [37:17] Gold and clear glass are no match for her,
|    Jewels of gold no exchange for her.
|  [37:18] Speak no of coral or crystal;
|    More precious than rubies is Wisdom.
|  [37:19] The topaz of Cush is no match for her.
|    In pure gold she cannot be valued.
|  [37:20] But Wisdom – whence cometh she?
|    Understanding – where hath she her home?
|  [37:21] She is hid from the eyes of all living,
|    Concealed from the birds of the air.
|  [37:22] Abaddon and Death declare,
|    "A rumour of her we have heard."
|  [37:23] But the way to her God understandeth,
|    And He alone knoweth her home.
|  [37:24] For He looks to the ends of the earth
|    And all things under heaven He beholds.
|  [37:25] when He settled the weight of the wind
|    And meted the waters by measure,
|  [37:26] Created a law for the rain,
|    And a path for the flash of the lightning,
|  [37:27] Even then did He see and declare her,
|    Establish and search her out.
|  [37:28] And He said unto man, "Behold!
|    The fear of Me – that is Wisdom,
|    And turning from wrong – Understanding."

##### Two Wonderful Creatures of God #####

#### The Hippopotamus ####

|  [37:15] Behold now the huge beast beside thee:
|    He eateth up grass like an ox.
|  [37:16] Behold now the strength in his loins,
|    And the force in the muscles of his belly.
|  [37:17] He holds his tail stiff as a cedar,
|    His thighs are of sinews entwined.
|  [37:18] His bones are as tubes of brass,
|    His limbs are like bars of iron.
|  [37:19] He is chief of the ways of God,
|    Made to lord it over his fellows.
|  [37:20] The mountains yields him their fruits;
|    All the wild beasts he grindeth to powder.
|  [37:21] There under the lotus he lies,
|    In the covert of reed and fen,
|  [37:22] Protected by shade of the lotus,
|    Encircled by water-willows.
|  [37:23] From the wild rushing torrent he flees not;
|    He is calm in the swell of a Jordan.
|  [37:24] Who would venture to make for his eyes,
|    Or to pierce through his nose with a cord?

#### The Crocodile ####

|  [37:1] Canst thou draw out the crocodile with hook,
|    Or press his tongue down with a cord?
|  [37:2] Canst thou put a rope into his nose,
|    Or pierce his jaws through with a hook?
|  [37:3] Will he make many prayers unto thee,
|    Or will he speak softly to thee?
|  [37:4] Will he make any tryst with thee,
|    To be kept as thy servant for ever?
|  [37:5] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird,
|    Or attach him to string for thy maidens?
|  [37:6] Shall the (fisher) guilds traffic in him?
|    Shall the merchants divide him in pieces?
|  [37:7] Canst thou fill his skin with barbs,
|    Or his head with the fish-harpon?
|  [37:8] Lay but thine hand upon him:
|    Remember the battle – enough!
|  [37:9] See! thy hope is but an illusion;
|    God hurleth the dread of him far.
|  [37:10] Not one is so bold as to rouse him;
|    Where is he that can stand before him?
|  [37:11] Who hath ever triumphantly braved him?
|    Beneath the whole heaven, not one.
|  [37:12] Of his limbs I will not keep silence,
|    Of his strength and his mighty equipment.
|  [37:13] Who can lay bare the face of his garment,
|    Or enter the folds of his breastplate?
|  [37:14] Who can open the doors of his face?
|    Round about his teeth lieth terror.
|  [37:15] His back is a ripple of shields,
|    And his breast is a seal of flint.
|  [37:16] One shield is so near to another
|    That no air can come between them.
|  [37:17] Each cleaveth so close to his fellow,
|    So locked, that they cannot be served.
|  [37:18] Through the breath of his nostrils light flashes,
|    His eyes are the lids of the morning.
|  [37:19] Out of his mouth go torches
|    And sparks of fire leap forth.
|  [37:20] Smoke issues out of his nostrils,
|    Like a seething and boiling pot.
|  [37:21] His breath setteth coals ablaze,
|    And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
|  [37:22] His neck is the home of strength,
|    And terror danceth before him.
|  [37:23] The flakes of his flesh are welded
|    So firm that they cannot be moved.
|  [37:24] His heart is as firm as a stone–
|    Yea, firm as the nether mill-stone.
|  [37:25] When he lifts himself, strong men are terrified;
|    At his teeth are the mighty dismayed.
|  [37:26] No sword availeth against him,
|    Nor spear nor dart nor arrow.
|  [37:27] He counteth iron as straw,
|    And brass as rotten wood;
|  [37:28] No arrow can put him to flight;
|    On him sling-stones are turned to stubble.
|  [37:29] Clubs are counted as reed,
|    And he laughs at the whirr of a javelin.
|  [37:30] Beneath him (his scales, like) sharp sherds
|    Spread marks, as of sledge, on the mire.
|  [37:31] He makes the deep boil like a pot;
|    He stirreth the sea like ointment.
|  [37:32] In his wake is a shinning path–
|    One would think the deep to be hoary.
|  [37:33] There is not his like upon earth,
|    Created to know no fear.
|  [37:34] Everything that is high is afraid of him:
|    He is king o’er the sons of pride.

 [Psalms 1] 

### Book One ###

##### Psalm 1 – The Way of Happiness #####

|  [1:1] Happy are those
|    who do not follow the counsel of the wicked,
|  not halting in ways frequented by sinners,
|    nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
|  [1:2] But the law of the LORD  is their joy,
|    they study it day and night.
|  [1:3] They are like trees
|    planted by runlets of water,
|  yielding fruit in due season,
|    leaves never fading.
|    In all that they do, they prosper.

|  [1:4] Not so fare the wicked, not so;
|    like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
|  [1:5] So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,
|    nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
|  [1:6] For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD,
|    but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

 [Psalms 2] 

##### Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen King #####

|  [2:1] Why this turmoil of nations,
|    this futile plotting of peoples,
|  [2:2] with kings of the earth conspiring,
|    and rulers consulting together,
|    against the LORD  and against his anointed,
|  [2:3] to snap their bonds
|    and fling their cords away?

|  [2:4] He whose throne is in heaven laughs,
|    the LORD  mocks them.
|  [2:5] Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
|    and in his hot anger confounds them.
|  [2:6] “This my king is installed by me,
|    on Zion my holy mountain.”

|  [2:7] I will tell of the LORD ’s decree.
|  He said to me: “You are my son,
|    this day I became your father.
|  [2:8] Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations,
|    and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
|  [2:9] You will break them with sceptre of iron,
|    shatter them like pottery.”

|  [2:10] So now, you kings, be wise:
|    be warned, you rulers of earth.
|  [2:11] Serve the LORD  in awe,
|    kiss his feet with trembling,
|  [2:12] lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;
|    for soon will his fury blaze.
|    Happy all who take refuge in him.

 [Psalms 3] 

##### Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for Protection #####

A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.

|  [3:1] How many, LORD, are my foes!
|    Those who rise up against me are many.
|  [3:2] Many are those who say of me,
|    “There is no help for him in his God.” *Selah*

|  [3:3] But you, LORD, are shield about me,
|    my glory, who lifts up my head.
|  [3:4] When loudly I call to the LORD,
|    from his holy hill he gives answer. *Selah*

|  [3:5] I laid down and slept:
|    now I wake, for the LORD  sustains me.
|  [3:6] I fear not the myriads of people
|    who beset me on every side.

|  [3:7] Arise, LORD : save me, my God,
|    who strikes all my foes on the cheek,
|    and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
|  [3:8] Victory belongs to the LORD :
|    let your blessing descend on your people. *Selah*

 [Psalms 4] 

##### Psalm 4 – An Evening Prayer #####

For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.

|  [4:1] Answer my cry,
|    God, my defender.
|  Often from straits you have brought me
|    to spacious places.
|  So now show me your favor
|    and hear my prayer.

|  [4:2] How long, you proud people,
|    will my honor be stained
|  by the slanders you love,
|    and the lies that you follow? *Selah*
|  [4:3] See! The LORD  has shown me
|    his wonderful kindness:
|  the LORD  hears,
|    when I call to him.

|  [4:4] Sin not in your anger:
|    but speak in your heart
|    on your bed, and be still. *Selah*
|  [4:5] Offer true sacrifice,
|    trust in the LORD .

|  [4:6] Many are longing
|    for fortune to smile.
|  Lift upon us
|    the light of your face.
|  [4:7] You have put in my heart, LORD,
|    a deeper joy
|  than was theirs who had corn
|    and wine in abundance.

|  [4:8] So in peace I will
|    lie down and sleep;
|  for you, LORD, keep me
|    safe.

 [Psalms 5] 

##### Psalm 5 – A Prayer for Guidance #####

For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.

|  [5:1] Hear my words, LORD :
|    give heed to my whisper.
|  [5:2] Attend to my loud cry for help,
|    my king and my God.
|  [5:3] When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning,
|    hear my voice.
|  I make ready for you in the morning,
|    and look for a sign.

|  [5:4] For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:
|    no one of evil can be your guest.
|  [5:5] No braggarts can stand in your presence,
|    you hate all workers of wrong.
|  [5:6] You destroy all speakers of lies,
|    people of blood and deceit you abhor.
|  [5:7] But I, through your kindness abundant,
|    may enter your house,
|  and towards the shrine of your temple
|    may reverently bow.

|  [5:8] Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness
|    because of my enemies.
|    Make your way level before me.
|  [5:9] For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
|    their heart is a pit of destruction.
|  Their throat is a wide open grave,
|    their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.

|  [5:10] Condemn them, God;
|    let their schemes bring them down to the ground.
|  For their numberless crimes thrust them down
|    for playing the rebel against you.
|  [5:11] But let all who take refuge in you
|    ring out their gladness forever.
|  Protect those who love your name,
|    so they may exult in you.
|  [5:12] For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly,
|    and the shield of your favor protects them.

 [Psalms 6] 

##### Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble #####

For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.

|  [6:1] Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger,
|    punish me not in your wrath.
|  [6:2] LORD, be gracious to me
|    in my weakness.
|  Heal me LORD,
|    for racked is my body;
|  [6:3] all of me utterly racked.
|    Why do you wait so long, LORD ?

|  [6:4] Turn, LORD, rescue me;
|    save me, because of your love.
|  [6:5] For in death none can call you to mind;
|    in Sheol who can praise you?

|  [6:6] I am so weary of sighing.
|    All the night I make my bed swim,
|    and wet my couch with my tears.
|  [6:7] My eyes swollen with grief;
|    from weeping caused by my foes.

|  [6:8] Begone, workers of wrong,
|    for the LORD  has heard my loud weeping,
|  [6:9] the LORD  has heard my entreaty,
|    the LORD  accepts my prayer.
|  [6:10] My foes will be stricken with terror,
|    brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

 [Psalms 7] 

##### Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of Justice #####

A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the 
LORD  about Cush, the Benjamite.

|  [7:1] LORD  my God, I take refuge in you.
|  Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
|    [7:2] or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
|    and rend me, past hope of rescue.

|  [7:3] LORD, my God, if my life has been such
|    if my hands have been stained with guilt,
|    [7:4] if friends I paid back with evil,
|    if I plundered my foes without cause,
|  [7:5] may the enemy chase and find me,
|     trample my life to the ground,
|    my honor leave in the dirt! *Selah*

|  [7:6] Arise, LORD, in anger,
|    against my foes rise in fury.
|  Awake for my help:
|    let justice be done.
|  [7:7] Gather the nations about you,
|    and sit on your lofty throne,
|    [7:8] as the LORD, the judge of the peoples.
|  Judge me, LORD, in my innocence
|    and according to my integrity.

|  [7:9] Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,
|    protect the righteous.
|  Searcher of hearts and minds,
|    righteous God.
|  [7:10] God is my shield:
|    he saves the upright in heart.

|  [7:11] God is a just judge,
|    constant in righteous anger.
|  [7:12] He will sharpen his sword without fail,
|    his bow is bent and ready,
|  [7:13] his deadly weapons are ready,
|    his arrows he makes of flame.

|  [7:14] The enemy who conceives evil;
|    pregnant with mischief,
|    giving birth to lies,
|  [7:15] a pit they have made and dug;
|    but into the hole that they made they will fall.
|  [7:16] On their own heads their mischief comes back;
|    on their own skulls their violence comes down.
|  [7:17] I will give thanks to the LORD  for his justice,
|    and sing to the name of the LORD  Most High.

 [Psalms 8] 

##### Psalm 8 – God’s Glory in Nature #####

For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.

|  [8:1] LORD  our God!
|    How glorious in all the earth is your name!
|  Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
|    [8:2] from the mouths of children and infants.

|  You have built a fortress
|    against your enemies,
|  to silence the foe and the rebel.

|  [8:3] When I look at your heavens,
|    the work of your fingers,
|  the moon and the stars,
|    which you have set there,
|  [8:4] what are mortals,
|    that you think of them,
|  humans,
|    that you visit them?

|  [8:5] Yet you made them little less than divine,
|    crowned them with glory and majesty,
|  [8:6] made them lord of the works of your hands,
|    put all things under their feet –
|  [8:7] sheep and oxen,
|    all of them;
|  and the wild beasts also:
|    [8:8] birds of the air,
|    and fish of the sea,
|    and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.

|  [8:9] LORD  our God!
|    How glorious in all the earth is your name!

 [Psalms 9] 

##### Psalm 9 – A Song of Praise the Lord’s Justice #####

For the leader; ’almuth labben. A psalm of David.

|  [9:1] With all my heart I will praise the LORD,
|    all your wonders I will rehearse.
|  [9:2] I will rejoice and exult in you,
|    singing praise to your name, Most High;
|  [9:3] because backward my foes were turned,
|    they stumbled and perished before you.

|  [9:4] My right and my claim you have upheld,
|    you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
|  [9:5] rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
|    and blotting their name out forever and ever.
|  [9:6] The foe is vanished, ruined forever,
|    their cities destroyed, their memory perished.

|  [9:7] See! The LORD  is seated forever
|    on the throne he established for judgment,
|  [9:8] ruling the world with justice,
|    and judging the nations with equity.

|  [9:9] So the LORD  proves a haven to the oppressed,
|    a haven in times of trouble.
|  [9:10] Well may they trust you who know your name,
|    for those who seek you, you never abandon.

|  [9:11] Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion,
|    declare his deeds among the nations.
|  [9:12] As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
|    he does not forget the cry of the wretched.

|  [9:13] Show me favor, LORD,
|    see how my foes afflict me,
|    lift me up from the gates of death;
|  [9:14] so I may, in your help exulting,
|    tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.

|  [9:15] The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
|    in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
|  [9:16] The LORD  is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
|    the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. *Selah*

|  [9:17] Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
|    all the nations that live forgetful of God.
|  [9:18] For the needy will not be always forgotten,
|    nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.

|  [9:19] Arise, LORD ; don’t let them triumph:
|    before your face let the nations be judged.
|  [9:20] Strike them with fear, LORD :
|    show the nations how frail they are. *Selah*

 [Psalms 10] 

##### Psalm 10 – A Prayer for Help #####

|  [10:1] Why do you stand, LORD, so far away,
|    hiding yourself in times of trouble?
|  [10:2] The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
|    let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.

|  [10:3] For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed;
|    the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,
|  [10:4] in wicked pride, thinks:
|    God doesn’t care,
|    God doesn’t call to account.

|  [10:5] Never a season that they do not prosper;
|    your judgments are far above out of their sight:
|    they scoff at their foes.

|  [10:6] Each says in their heart,
|    “I will never be shaken;
|  I will live for all time
|    untouched by misfortune.”
|  [10:7] Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression:
|    under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.

|  [10:8] Lying in secret in some village ambush,
|    and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
|  [10:9] Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair
|    they lurk intending to catch the defenceless;
|    to seize them, to drag them away in their net.

|  [10:10] Their victims are crushed,
|    sink down to the ground.
|  Under their claws
|    the hapless fall.
|  [10:11] The wicked say in their hearts
|    that God has forgotten,
|  has hidden his face,
|    will see nothing.

|  [10:12] Arise, LORD, lift up your hand,
|    do not forget the cry of the wretched.
|  [10:13] Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
|    and say in their hearts, “God doesn’t care”?

|  [10:14] You have seen the trouble and sorrow;
|    you mark it all, and will take it in hand.
|  The hapless can count on you,
|    helper of orphans.

|  [10:15] Break the arm of the wicked and evil:
|    search out their sin, till no more be found.
|  [10:16] The LORD  is king forever and ever:
|    the nations will vanish from his land.

|  [10:17] LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble,
|    inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
|  [10:18] rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
|    so no one on earth may strike terror again.

 [Psalms 11] 

##### Psalm 11 – Trust in the Lord #####

For the leader. Of David.

|  [11:1] In the LORD  I take refuge.
|    How can you tell me
|  to flee like a bird to the mountains?

|  [11:2] “See! The wicked are bending the bow,
|    their arrow is set on the string,
|    to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
|  [11:3] In this tearing down of foundations
|    what good can a good person do?”

|  [11:4] The LORD  in his holy temple,
|    the LORD  in heaven, enthroned.
|  His eyes watch the world,
|    they see everyone.
|  [11:5] The LORD  examines the righteous and wicked,
|    and the lover of violence he hates.
|  [11:6] On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,
|    and their drink will be scorching wind.
|  [11:7] For the LORD  is just, and justice he loves;
|    so the upright will see his face.

 [Psalms 12] 

##### Psalm 12 – A Prayer for the Faithful in a False World #####

For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.

|  [12:1] Help, LORD, for the good are all gone,
|    faithful people have vanished.
|  [12:2] One lies to another, speaking empty lies,
|    with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.

|  [12:3] May the LORD  cut off all the flattering lips,
|    and the tongue that utters arrogance,
|  [12:4] they declare, “Our tongue is our strength,
|    our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”

|  [12:5] “The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing;
|    so now I will act,” the LORD  declares
|    “And place them in the safety they long for.”

|  [12:6] The words of the LORD  are words that are pure,
|    silver smelted, seven times refined.
|  [12:7] You will keep us, LORD,
|    and guard us from this generation forever,
|  [12:8] in a world where the wicked prowl,
|    and worthless people exalted.

 [Psalms 13] 

##### Psalm 13 – A Prayer for Help in Trouble #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [13:1] How long, LORD, will you forget me forever?
|    How long will you hide your face from me?
|  [13:2] How long must I nurse grief inside me,
|    and in my heart a daily sorrow?
|    How long are my foes to exult over me?

|  [13:3] Look at me, answer me, LORD  my God.
|  Fill my eyes with your light,
|    lest I sleep in death,
|    [13:4] lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
|    lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.

|  [13:5] But I trust in your kindness:
|    my heart will rejoice in your help.
|    [13:6] I will sing to the LORD  who was good to me.

 [Psalms 14] 

##### Psalm 14 – The Folly of Denying God #####

For the leader. Of David.

|  [14:1] Fools say in their heart,
|    “There is no God.”
|  Vile, hateful their life is;
|    not one does good.

|  [14:2] From heaven the LORD  looks out
|    on humans, to see
|  if any are wise,
|    and care for God.

|  [14:3] But all have turned bad,
|    the taint is on all;
|  not one does good,
|    no, not one.

|  [14:4] Have they learned their lesson,
|    those workers of evil?
|  Who ate up my people,
|    eating, devouring,
|    never calling to the LORD .

|  [14:5] Sore afraid will they be;
|    for God is among
|    those who are righteous,
|  [14:6] you may mock the plans of the poor,
|    but the LORD  is their refuge.

|  [14:7] If only help from Zion
|    would come for Israel!
|  When the LORD  brings his people
|    a change of fortune,
|  how glad will be Jacob,
|    and Israel how joyful!

 [Psalms 15] 

##### Psalm 15 – Standing Firm #####

A psalm of David.

|  [15:1] LORD, who can be guest in your tent?
|    Who may live on your holy mountain?

|  [15:2] The person whose walk is blameless,
|    whose conduct is right,
|  whose words are true and sincere;
|    [15:3] on whose tongue there sits no slander,
|  who will not harm a friend,
|    [15:4] nor cruelly insult a neighbor,
|  who regards with contempt those rejected by God;
|    but honors those who obey the LORD,
|  who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
|    [15:5] whose money is lent without interest,
|  and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.

|  The person who does these things will always stand firm.

 [Psalms 16] 

##### Psalm 16 – The Joy of Fellowship with God #####

A michtam of David.

|  [16:1] Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
|    [16:2] I said to the LORD, “You are my LORD,
|  my happiness rests in you alone.
|  [16:3] Those who are holy in the land,
|    they, they alone, are the noble ones;
|    all my delight is in them.”

|  [16:4] Those who choose other gods
|    find endless sorrow.
|  In their offerings of blood I will have no part
|    nor take their name on my lips.
|  [16:5] The LORD  is my share and my portion,
|    my fate is in your strong hands.

|  [16:6] The boundary lines of my life
|    mark out delightful country,
|    my heritage pleases me well.
|  [16:7] I praise the LORD  for his counsel,
|    which so stirs my heart in the night.
|  [16:8] I keep the LORD  always in mind:
|    with him at my hand, I can never be moved.

|  [16:9] So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
|    and in safety of body I live.
|  [16:10] For you will not give me up to Sheol
|    nor let any who love you see the pit.
|  [16:11] You will show me the path that leads to life,
|    to that fulness of joy which is in your presence,
|    and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

 [Psalms 17] 

##### Psalm 17 – A Prayer for Deliverance #####

A prayer of David.

|  [17:1] Listen, O LORD, to my innocence;
|    attend to my piercing cry.
|  Give heed to my prayer
|    out of lips unfeigned.
|  [17:2] Let my vindication come from you,
|    your eyes see the truth.

|  [17:3] When you test my heart when you visit at night,
|    and assay me like silver – you can find no evil.
|  I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
|    [17:4] I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
|  [17:5] My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
|    and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.

|  [17:6] So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
|    bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
|  [17:7] Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemies
|    those who take refuge at your right hand.

|  [17:8] Keep me as the apple of the eye,
|    hide me in the shelter of your wings.
|  [17:9] From wicked people who do me violence,
|    from deadly foes who crowd around me.

|  [17:10] They have closed their hearts to pity,
|    the words of their mouths are haughty.
|  [17:11] Now they dog us at every step,
|    keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
|  [17:12] like a lion, longing to tear,
|    like a young lion, lurking in secret.

|  [17:13] Arise, LORD, face them and fell them.
|    By your sword set me free from the wicked,
|  [17:14] by your hand, O LORD, from those –
|    whose portion of life is but of this world.
|  But let your treasured ones have food in plenty
|  may their children be full and their children satisfied.

|    [17:15] In my innocence I will see your face,
|  awake I am filled with a vision of you.

 [Psalms 18] 

##### Psalm 18 – A King’s Song of Gratitude #####

For the leader. Of David, the servant of the 
LORD, who recited the words of this song to the LORD  after the LORD  had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:

|  [18:1] I love you, O LORD, my strength.
|  [18:2] The LORD  is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
|    my God, my rock, where I take refuge,
|    my shield, my defender, my tower.
|  [18:3] Worthy of praise is the LORD  whom I call on,
|    he rescues me from all my foes.

|  [18:4] The waves of death broke about me,
|    fearful floods of chaos.
|  [18:5] Sheol threw cords around me,
|    snares of death came to meet me.
|  [18:6] In distress I cried to the LORD,
|    and shouted for help to my God;
|  in his temple he heard my voice,
|    into his ears came my cry.

|  [18:7] Then the earth shook and quaked,
|    mountains trembled to their foundations,
|    and quaked because of his wrath.
|  [18:8] Smoke went up from his nostrils,
|    devouring fire from his mouth,
|    coals were kindled by it.

|  [18:9] Then he bent the sky and came down,
|    thick darkness was under his feet.
|  [18:10] He rode on a cherub and flew,
|    darting on wings of wind,
|  [18:11] with his screen of darkness about him,
|    in thick dark clouds of water.

|  [18:12] At the radiance before him there passed
|    hailstones and coals of fire.
|  [18:13] The LORD  thundered from heaven,
|    the Most High uttered his voice.
|  [18:14] He shot his arrows and scattered them,
|    flashed lightnings, and routed them.
|  [18:15] The channels of the sea were revealed,
|    the world was laid bare to its base,
|  at your rebuke, O LORD,
|    at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

|  [18:16] He stretched from on high, he seized me,
|    drew me up from the mighty waters,
|  [18:17] and saved me from those who hated me –
|    fierce foes, too mighty for me.
|  [18:18] In my day of distress they assailed me,
|    but the LORD  proved my support.
|  [18:19] To a spacious place he brought me,
|    and, for love of me, he saved me.

|  [18:20] The LORD  repays my innocence,
|    he rewards my cleanness of hands.
|  [18:21] For I kept the ways of the LORD,
|    nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
|  [18:22] His commandments were all before me,
|    his statutes I put not away.
|  [18:23] And I was blameless before him,
|    guarding myself from sin.
|  [18:24] So the LORD  repaid my innocence,
|    my cleanness of hands in his sight.

|  [18:25] With the loyal you are loyal,
|    and with the blameless blameless.
|  [18:26] With the pure you show yourself pure,
|    but shrewd with the devious.
|  [18:27] For the lowly people you save,
|    but haughty eyes you abase.
|  [18:28] You are my lamp, LORD,
|    my God who enlightens my darkness.
|  [18:29] With you I can storm a rampart,
|    with my God I can leap a wall.
|  [18:30] As for God, his way is perfect;
|    the word of the LORD  is pure.
|    He is shield to all who take refuge in him.

|  [18:31] For who is God but the LORD ?
|    And who is a rock but our God?
|  [18:32] The God who arms me with strength,
|    who cleared and smoothed my way.
|  [18:33] He made my feet like hinds’ feet,
|    and set me up on the heights.
|  [18:34] He taught my hands how to fight,
|    and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.

|  [18:35] The shield of your help you gave me,
|    your right hand supports me,
|    you stoop down to make me great.
|  [18:36] In your strength I took giant strides,
|    and my feet never slipped.
|  [18:37] So I chased the foe till I caught them,
|    and turned not, till I made an end of them.
|  [18:38] I smashed them, they could not rise,
|    they fell beneath my feet.

|  [18:39] You did arm me with strength for war,
|    you did bow my assailants beneath me.
|  [18:40] You made my foes turn their back to me,
|    and those who did hate me I finished.
|  [18:41] They cried for help, but none saved them;
|    to the LORD, but he answered them not.
|  [18:42] I beat them like dust of the market-place,
|    stamped them like mud of the streets.

|  [18:43] From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
|    you made me head of the nations,
|    peoples I knew not did serve me.
|  [18:44] On the instant they hear, they obey me,
|    foreigners come to me cringing.
|  [18:45] Foreigners lose courage,
|    and come out of their strongholds trembling.

|  [18:46] The LORD  is alive! Blest be my rock!
|    Exalted be God, my protector!
|  [18:47] The God who gave me revenge,
|    and brought down nations beneath me,
|  [18:48] who saved me from angry foes,
|    and set me above my assailants,
|    safe from the violent.

|  [18:49] For this I will praise you among the nations,
|    making music, O LORD, to your name:
|  [18:50] for great triumphs he grants to his king,
|    and faithful love he shows his anointed,
|    to David and his seed evermore.

 [Psalms 19] 

##### Psalm 19 – The Glory of God in the Heavens #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [19:1] The heavens declare God’s glory,
|    the sky tells what his hands have done.
|  [19:2] Day tells it to day,
|    night reveals it to night,
|  [19:3] without speaking, without words;
|    without the sound of voices.
|  [19:4] But through all the world their voice carries
|    their words to the ends of the earth.

|  He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
|    [19:5] it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber,
|  it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
|    [19:6] From one end of the heavens it rises,
|  and around it runs to the other,
|    and nothing hides from its heat.

##### In Praise of the Law #####

|  [19:7] The law of the LORD  is perfect,
|    renewing life.
|  The decrees of the LORD  are trusty,
|    making the simple wise.

|  [19:8] The behests of the LORD  are right,
|    rejoicing the heart.
|  The command of the LORD  is pure,
|    giving light to the eyes.

|  [19:9] The fear of the LORD  is clean,
|    it endures forever.
|  The LORD ’s judgments are true
|    and right altogether.

|  [19:10] More precious are they than gold –
|    than fine gold in plenty,
|  and sweeter they are than honey,
|    that drops from the comb.

|  [19:11] By them is your servant warned;
|    who keeps them has rich reward.
|  [19:12] Who can know their flaws?
|    Absolve me from those I know not.

|  [19:13] Keep your servant from wilful sins –
|    from falling under their sway:
|  then blameless and clear will I be
|    from great offense.

|  [19:14] May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
|    be pleasing to you, LORD,
|    my rock and redeemer.

 [Psalms 20] 

##### Psalm 20 – A Prayer for Victory #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [20:1] The LORD  answer you in the day of distress,
|    the name of the Jacob’s God protect you,
|  [20:2] sending you help from the temple,
|    out of Zion supporting you.

|  [20:3] All your meal-offerings may he remember,
|    your burnt-offerings look on with favor. *Selah*
|  [20:4] May he grant you your heart’s desire,
|    and bring all your plans to pass.
|  [20:5] We will shout then for joy at your victory,
|    and rejoice in the name of our God.
|    May the LORD  grant your every request.

|  [20:6] Now I am sure that the LORD
|     will help his anointed.
|  From his temple in heaven he will answer
|    by his mighty triumphant right hand.
|  [20:7] Some in chariots are strong, some in horses;
|    but our strength is the LORD  our God.
|  [20:8] They will totter and fall,
|    while we rise and stand firm.

|  [20:9] Give victory, LORD, to the king,
|    and answer us when we call.

 [Psalms 21] 

##### Psalm 21 – A Prayer after a Victory #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [21:1] The king rejoices, LORD, in your might,
|    how he exults because of your help!
|  [21:2] You have granted to him his heart’s desire,
|    you have not withheld his lips’ request. *Selah*

|  [21:3] You came to meet him with rich blessings,
|    you set on his head a golden crown.
|  [21:4] He asked you for life, you gave it –
|    many long days, forever and ever.

|  [21:5] Great is his glory because of your help,
|    honor and majesty you lay upon him.
|  [21:6] For you make him most blessed forever,
|    you make him glad with the joy of your presence.

|  [21:7] For the king puts always his trust in the LORD ;
|    the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
|  [21:8] Your hand will reach all your foes,
|    your right hand, all who hate you.
|  [21:9] You will make them like a furnace of fire,
|    when you appear, LORD .
|  The LORD  will swallow them up in his wrath.
|    The fire will devour them.
|  [21:10] You will sweep their offspring from the earth,
|    their children from humanity.
|  [21:11] When they scheme against you
|    and hatch evil plots – they will fail.
|  [21:12] For you aim your bow at their faces,
|    make them turn in flight.

|  [21:13] Be exalted, LORD, in your strength,
|  to your might we shall sing and make music.

 [Psalms 22] 

##### Psalm 22 – The Sufferer’s Triumph #####

For the leader; set to ‘Deer of the Dawn’. A psalm of David.

|  [22:1] My God, my God, why have you left me,
|    my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
|  [22:2] I cry in the day, you do not answer,
|  I cry in the night but find no rest.

|  [22:3] You are the Holy One,
|    throned on the praises of Israel.
|  [22:4] In you our ancestors trusted,
|    they trusted and you delivered them.
|  [22:5] They cried to you, and found safety,
|    in you did they trust and were not put to shame.

|  [22:6] But I am a worm, not a person;
|    insulted by others, despised by the people.
|  [22:7] All who see me mock me,
|    with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
|  [22:8] “He relies on the LORD ; let him save him.
|    Let him rescue the one he holds dear!”

|  [22:9] But you drew me from the womb,
|    laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
|  [22:10] On your care was I cast from my very birth,
|    you are my God from my mother’s womb.
|  [22:11] Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,
|  and there is none to help.

|  [22:12] I am circled by many bulls,
|    beset by the mighty of Bashan,
|  [22:13] who face me with gaping jaws,
|    like ravening roaring lions.
|  [22:14] Poured out am I like water,
|    and all my bones are loosened.
|  My heart is become like wax,
|    melted within me.

|  [22:15] My palate is dry as a sherd,
|    my tongue sticks to my jaws;
|    in the dust of death you lay me.
|  [22:16] For dogs are round about me,
|    a band of knaves encircles me,
|    gnawing my hands and my feet.
|  [22:17] I can count my bones, every one.
|    As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
|  [22:18] They divide my garments among them,
|    and over my raiment cast lots.

|  [22:19] But you, O LORD, be not far,
|    O my strength, hasten to help me.
|  [22:20] Deliver my life from the sword
|    my life from the power of the dogs.
|  [22:21] Save me from the jaws of the lion,
|    from the horns of the wild oxen help me.

|  [22:22] I will tell of your fame to my kindred,
|    and in the assembly will praise you.
|  [22:23] Praise the LORD, you who fear him.
|    All Jacob’s seed, give him glory.
|    All Israel’s seed, stand in awe of him.

|  [22:24] For he has not despised nor abhorred
|    the sorrow of the sorrowful.
|  He hid not his face from me,
|    but he listened to my cry for help.

|  [22:25] Of you is my praise in the great congregation;
|    my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
|  [22:26] The afflicted will eat to their heart’s desire,
|    and those who seek after the LORD  will praise him.
|    Lift up your hearts forever.
|  [22:27] All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth,
|    and turn to the LORD ;
|  and all tribes of the nations will bow down before you.
|  [22:28] For the kingdom belongs to the LORD :
|    he is the LORD  of the nations.
|  [22:29] To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth,
|    and before him bend all who go down to the dust,
|    and those who could not preserve their lives.
|  [22:30] My descendants will tell of the LORD
|     to the next generation;
|  [22:31] they will declare his righteousness
|    to people yet to be born:
|    He has done it.

 [Psalms 23] 

##### Psalm 23 – The Good Shepherd #####

A psalm of David.

|  [23:1] The LORD  is my shepherd: I am never in need.
|    [23:2] He lays me down in green pastures.
|  He gently leads me to waters of rest,
|    [23:3] he refreshes my life.
|  He guides me along paths that are straight,
|    true to his name.

|  [23:4] And when my way lies through a valley of gloom,
|    I fear no evil, for you are with me.
|  Your rod and your staff comfort me.

|  [23:5] You spread a table for me
|    in face of my foes;
|  with oil you anoint my head,
|    and my cup runs over.
|  [23:6] Surely goodness and love will pursue me –
|    all the days of my life.
|  In the house of the LORD  I will live
|    through the length of the days.

 [Psalms 24] 

##### Psalm 24 – The True Worshipper #####

Of David. A psalm.

|  [24:1] The earth is the LORD ’s and all that it holds,
|    the world and those who live in it.
|  [24:2] For he founded it on the seas,
|    and on the floods he sustains it.

|  [24:3] Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
|    Who may stand in his holy place?
|  [24:4] The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
|    who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
|    nor swears with intent to deceive:
|  [24:5] they win from the LORD  a blessing:
|    God is their champion and savior.
|  [24:6] Such must be those who resort to him,
|    and seek the face of the God of Jacob. *Selah*

|  [24:8] “Who is the glorious king?”
|    “The LORD  strong and heroic,
|    the LORD  heroic in battle.”

|  [24:9] Lift high your heads, you gates –
|    Higher, you ancient doors;
|    welcome the glorious king.
|  [24:10] “Who is the glorious king?”
|    “The LORD, the God of hosts,
|    he is the glorious king.” *Selah*

 [Psalms 25] 

##### Psalm 25 – A Prayer for Forgiveness and Protection #####

A psalm of David.

|  [25:1] To you, O LORD, I lift up my heart:
|    all the day I wait for you.
|  [25:2] In you I trust, put me not to shame;
|    let not my foes exult over me.
|  [25:3] None will be shamed who wait for you,
|    but shame will fall upon wanton traitors.
|  [25:4] Make me, O LORD, to know your ways:
|    teach me your paths.
|  [25:5] In your faithfulness guide me and teach me,
|    for you are my God and my savior.
|  [25:6] Remember your pity, O LORD, and your kindness,
|    for they have been ever of old.
|  [25:7] Do not remember the sins of my youth;
|    remember me in kindness,
|    because of your goodness, LORD .
|  [25:8] Good is the LORD  and upright,
|    so he teaches sinners the way.
|  [25:9] The humble he guides in the right,
|    he teaches the humble his way.
|  [25:10] All his ways are loving and loyal
|    to those who observe his charges and covenant.
|  [25:11] Be true to your name LORD,
|    forgive my many sins.
|  [25:12] Who then is the person who fears the LORD ?
|    He will teach them the way to choose.
|  [25:13] They will live in prosperity,
|    their children will inherit the land.
|  [25:14] The LORD  gives guidance to those who fear him,
|    and with his covenant he makes them acquainted.
|  [25:15] My eyes are ever toward the LORD,
|    for out of the net he brings my foot.
|  [25:16] Turn to me with your favor,
|    for I am lonely and crushed
|  [25:17] In my heart are strain and storm;
|    bring me out of my distresses.
|  [25:18] Look on my misery and trouble,
|    and pardon all my sins,
|  [25:19] look on my foes oh, so many!
|    And their cruel hatred towards me.
|  [25:20] Deliver me, keep me, and shame not
|    one who takes refuge in you.
|  [25:21] May integrity and innocence preserve me,
|    for I wait for you, O LORD .

|  [25:22] Redeem Israel, O God,
|    from all its distresses.

 [Psalms 26] 

##### Psalm 26 – Prayer of a Devout Worshipper #####

A psalm of David.

|  [26:1] Defend me, O LORD, for my walk has been blameless;
|    in the LORD  have I trusted unswervingly:
|  [26:2] Examine me, LORD, and test me;
|    test my heart and my mind.
|  [26:3] For your love is before my eyes,
|    and your faithfulness governs my way.

|  [26:4] I never sat down with the worthless,
|    nor companied with dissemblers.
|  [26:5] I hate the assembly of knaves,
|    I would never sit down with the wicked;
|  [26:6] but, with hands washed in innocence,
|    I would march round your altar, O LORD,
|  [26:7] singing loud songs of thanks,
|    and telling of all your wonders.
|  [26:8] O LORD, I love your house,
|    the place where your glory lives.

|  [26:9] Do not gather me up with sinners;
|    slay me not with people of blood,
|  [26:10] whose hands are stained with villainy,
|    and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
|  [26:11] But my walk is blameless!
|    O redeem me, be gracious to me.
|  [26:12] My foot stands on even ground,
|    in the choirs I will bless the LORD .

 [Psalms 27] 

##### Psalm 27 – If God is for Me #####

A psalm of David.

|  [27:1] The LORD  is my light and my savior;
|    whom then should I fear?
|  The LORD  protects my life;
|    whom then should I dread?

|  [27:2] When the wicked drew near to assail me
|    and eat up my flesh,
|  it was those who distressed and opposed me
|    who stumbled and fell.

|  [27:3] Though against me a host should encamp,
|    yet my heart would be fearless:
|  though battle should rise up against me,
|    still would I be trustful.

|  [27:4] One thing have I asked of the LORD,
|    and that do I long for –
|  To live in the house of the LORD
|     all the days of my life,
|  to gaze on the grace of the LORD
|     and inquire in his temple.

|  [27:5] For he will hide me in his shelter
|    in the day of misfortune.
|  In his sheltering tent he hides me:
|    he lifts me up on a rock.

|  [27:6] And now that my head he has lifted
|  above my encircling foes,
|  I will march round the altar and sacrifice,
|    shouting with joy, in his tent,
|    making music and song to the LORD .

##### The Serenity of Faith #####

|  [27:7] Hear, O LORD, my loud cry,
|    and graciously answer me.
|  [27:8] My heart has said to you,
|    “Your face, O LORD, I seek.”

|  [27:9] Hide not your face from me,
|    reject not your servant in anger:
|    for you have been my help.
|  Abandon me not, nor forsake me,
|    O God of my help:
|  [27:10] for father and mother have left me;
|    but the LORD  will take me up.

|  [27:11] Teach me your way, O LORD :
|    lead me in an even path,
|    because of my enemies.
|  [27:12] Give me not up, O LORD,
|    unto the rage of my foes;
|  for against me have risen false witnesses,
|    breathing out cruelty.

|  [27:13] Firm is the faith I cherish,
|    that I, in the land of the living,
|    will yet see the goodness of God.
|  [27:14] Let your heart be courageous and strong,
|    and wait on the LORD .

 [Psalms 28] 

##### Psalm 28 – An Answered Prayer for Help #####

Of David.

|  [28:1] Unto you, O LORD, do I cry;
|    my rock, be not deaf to me:
|  lest, through holding your peace, I become
|    like those who go down to the pit.
|  [28:2] Hear my loud entreaty,
|    as I cry for help to you,
|  lifting my hands, O LORD,
|    towards your holy chancel.

|  [28:3] Take me not off with the wicked,
|    nor with the workers of wrong,
|  whose speech to their neighbors is friendly,
|    while evil is in their heart.
|  [28:4] Give them as they have done,
|    as their wicked deeds deserve.
|  As their hands have wrought, so give to them:
|    requite to them their deserts.
|  [28:5] They are blind to all that the LORD  does,
|    to all that his hands have wrought;
|  and so he will tear them down,
|    to build them up no more.

|  [28:6] Blest be the LORD, who has heard
|    my voice as I plead for mercy.
|  [28:7] The LORD  is my strength and my shield;
|    my heart trusts in him.
|  I was helped: so my heart is exultant,
|    and in my song I will praise him.

|  [28:8] The LORD  is the strength of his people,
|    the fortress who saves his anointed.
|  [28:9] O save your people,
|    and bless your inheritance.
|  Be their shepherd
|    and carry them forever.

 [Psalms 29] 

##### Psalm 29 – The Lord’s Glory in the Storm #####

A psalm of David.

|  [29:1] Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
|    ascribe to the LORD  glory and power
|  [29:2] Ascribe to the LORD  the glory he manifests:
|    bow to the LORD  in holy array.

|  [29:3] The LORD ’s voice peals on the waters.
|    The God of glory has thundered.
|    He peals o’er the mighty waters.
|  [29:4] The LORD ’s voice sounds with strength,
|    the LORD ’s voice sounds with majesty.

|  [29:5] The LORD ’s voice breaks the cedars,
|    he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
|  [29:6] making Lebanon dance like a calf,
|    Sirion like a young wild ox.

|  [29:7] The LORD ’s voice hews out flames of fire.
|  [29:8] The LORD ’s voice rends the desert,
|    he rends the desert of Kadesh.

|  [29:9] The LORD ’s voice whirls the oaks,
|    and strips the forests bare;
|    and all in his temple say “Glory.”

|  [29:10] The LORD  was king at the flood,
|    the LORD  sits throned forever.
|  [29:11] The LORD  gives strength to his people,
|    he blesses his people with peace.

 [Psalms 30] 

##### Psalm 30 – A Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance #####

A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple.

|  [30:1] I will extol you, O LORD,
|    because you have lifted me up,
|  and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.

|  [30:2] I cried to you for help,
|    O LORD  my God, and you healed me.
|  [30:3] You have brought me up, LORD, from Sheol,
|    from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.

|  [30:4] Sing praise to the LORD, faithful people;
|    give thanks to his holy name.
|  [30:5] For his anger lasts only a moment,
|    his favor endures for a lifetime.
|  Weeping may lodge for the night,
|    but the morning brings shouts of joy.

|  [30:6] When all went well, I imagined
|    that never should I be shaken.
|  [30:7] For by your favor, O LORD,
|    you had set me on mountains strong:
|  but you hide your face,
|    and I was confounded.

|  [30:8] Then to you, LORD, I cried,
|    to the LORD  I begged for mercy,
|  [30:9] “What profit is there in my blood,
|    if I go down to the pit?
|  Can you be praised by dust?
|    Can it tell of your faithfulness?
|  [30:10] Hear, LORD, and show me your favor,
|    LORD  be a helper to me.”

|  [30:11] You have turned my mourning to dancing;
|    my sackcloth you have unloosed,
|    and clothed me with joy:
|  [30:12] that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
|    and give thanks to you, LORD  my God, forever.

 [Psalms 31] 

##### Psalm 31 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Troubles #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [31:1] In you, O LORD, I take refuge;
|    let me never be put to shame.
|  Rescue me in your faithfulness;
|    [31:2] incline to me your ear.
|  Deliver me speedily.
|    Be to me a rock of defence,
|  a fortified house, to save me.
|    [31:3] For my rock and my fortress are you;
|  lead me and guide me so your name will be honored.
|    [31:4] Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
|  for you yourself are my refuge.
|    [31:5] Into your hand I commend my spirit:
|    you ransom me, LORD, faithful God.
|  [31:6] I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
|    I trust in the LORD .
|  [31:7] I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
|    because you have looked on my misery,
|    and cared for me in my distress.
|  [31:8] You have not given me into the enemy’s hand,
|    you have set my feet in a spacious place.

|  [31:9] Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed;
|    my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
|  [31:10] For my life is consumed with grief,
|    and my years with sighing.
|  My strength is broken with misery,
|    my bones waste away.
|  [31:11] The scorn of all my foes,
|    the butt of my neighbors am I,
|    a terror to my acquaintance.
|  At the sight of me in the street
|    people turn quickly away.
|  [31:12] I am clean forgotten like the dead,
|    am become like a ruined vessel.
|  [31:13] I hear the whispers of many –
|    terror on every side –
|  scheming together against me,
|    plotting to take my life.

|  [31:14] But my trust is in you, LORD .
|    “You are my God,” I say;
|  [31:15] my times are in your hand, save me
|    from the hand of the foes who pursue me.
|  [31:16] Make your face to shine on your servant,
|    save me in your love.
|  [31:17] Put me not, O LORD, to shame,
|    for I have called upon you.
|  Let the wicked be put to shame
|    silent in Sheol.
|  [31:18] Strike the false lips dumb,
|    that speak proudly against the righteous
|    with haughtiness and contempt.

|  [31:19] How great is the goodness
|    you have treasured for those who fear you,
|  and wrought for those who take refuge in you,
|    in plain sight of all!
|  [31:20] In your sheltering wings you hide them
|    from plottings of people,
|  you keep them safe in a bower
|    from the chiding of tongues.

|  [31:21] Blest be the LORD
|     for the wonderful love he has shown me
|    in time of distress.
|  [31:22] For I had said in panic,
|    “I am driven clean out of your sight.”
|  But you heard my plea,
|    when I cried to you for help.

|  [31:23] Love the LORD, all you faithful;
|    the LORD  protects the loyal,
|  but repays the haughty in full.
|  [31:24] Let your hearts be courageous and strong,
|    all you who wait on the LORD .

 [Psalms 32] 

##### Psalm 32 – A Prayer of Confession and Joy #####

Of David. A maskil.

|  [32:1] Happy those whose transgression is pardoned,
|    whose sin is covered.
|  [32:2] Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit,
|    to whom the LORD  reckons no debt of guilt.

|  [32:3] When I held my peace, my bones wore away
|    with my endless groaning;
|  [32:4] for day and night did your hand
|    lie heavy upon me.
|  The sap of my life was dried up
|    as with fierce summer-heat. *Selah*

|  [32:5] I began to acknowledge my sin,
|    not concealing my guilt;
|  and the moment I vowed to confess
|    to the LORD  my transgression,
|  then you yourself did pardon
|    the guilt of my sin. *Selah*

|  [32:6] For this cause let all who are faithful
|    pray to you in the time of distress;
|  then, when the great waters rush,
|    they will not reach to him.
|  [32:7] For you are my shelter,
|    you protect me from trouble,
|    and surround me with deliverance. *Selah*

|  [32:8] “With my eye steadfastly upon you,
|    I will instruct and teach you
|    The way you should go.
|  [32:9] Do not be like the horse or the mule,
|    that have no understanding,
|  but need bridle and halter to curb them,
|    else they will not come near to you.”

|  [32:10] The godless have many sorrows,
|    but those who trust in the LORD
|     will be compassed about by his kindness.
|  [32:11] Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous;
|    and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.

 [Psalms 33] 

##### Psalm 33 – A Hymn of Thanksgiving #####

|  [33:1] Shout for joy in the LORD, you righteous:
|    praise for the upright is seemly.
|  [33:2] Give thanks to the LORD  on the lyre,
|    play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
|  [33:3] Sing to him a new song,
|    play skilfully and shout merrily.
|  [33:4] For the LORD  is straight in his promise;
|    and all that he does is in faithfulness.
|  [33:5] Justice and right he loves;
|    the earth is full of his kindness.

|  [33:6] By his word the heavens were made,
|    all their host by the breath of his mouth.
|  [33:7] He gathers the sea in a bottle,
|    the ocean he puts into store-houses.
|  [33:8] Let the whole world honor the LORD,
|    let all who live on earth be in awe.
|  [33:9] For at his word it came into being,
|    at his command it stood forth.

|  [33:10] The LORD  frustrates the designs of the nations,
|    what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
|  [33:11] but the LORD ’s own design will stand forever,
|    and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
|  [33:12] Happy the nation whose God is the LORD,
|    the people he chose for himself as his own.

|  [33:13] The LORD  looks down from heaven,
|    he sees all of humanity;
|  [33:14] from where he rules he gazes
|    on all who inhabit the earth.
|  [33:15] He fashions the hearts of them all,
|    and gives heed to all that they do.

|  [33:16] It is not by great armies that kings are victorious,
|    it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
|  [33:17] false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory,
|    for all its great might it can provide no escape.

|  [33:18] See! The eye of the LORD  is on those who fear him,
|    on those who hope in his kindness;
|  [33:19] to deliver their life from death,
|    and to keep them alive in famine.

|  [33:20] We wait for the LORD :
|    he is our help and our shield.
|  [33:21] For in him our heart is glad,
|    we trust in his holy name.

|  [33:22] Let your kindness, O LORD, be upon us,
|    as is our hope in you.

 [Psalms 34] 

##### Psalm 34 – The Lord is Mindful of His Own #####

Of David, when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left.

|  [34:1] I will bless the LORD  at all times,
|    in my mouth will his praise be forever.
|  [34:2] In the LORD  will my heart make her boast,
|    the humble will hear and be glad.
|  [34:3] O magnify the LORD  with me
|    and let us extol his name together.
|  [34:4] I sought the LORD, and, in answer,
|    he saved me from all my terrors.
|  [34:5] Look to him and you will be radiant,
|    with faces unashamed.
|  [34:6] Here is one who was crushed,
|    but cried and was heard by the LORD,
|    and brought safe out of every trouble.
|  [34:7] The LORD ’s angel encamps
|    about those who fear him, and rescues them.
|  [34:8] O taste and see that the LORD  is good,
|    happy those who take refuge in him.
|  [34:9] Fear the LORD, all his people,
|    for they who fear him lack nothing.
|  [34:10] Even young lions may be poor and hungry,
|    but those who seek the LORD
|     will not lack any good thing.

|  [34:11] Come, children, listen to me.
|    I will teach you the fear of the LORD .
|  [34:12] Which of you is desirous of life,
|    loves many and happy days?
|  [34:13] Then guard your tongue from evil,
|    and your lips from speaking deceit.
|  [34:14] Depart from evil, and do good;
|    seek peace, and pursue it.
|  [34:15] The eyes of the LORD  are towards the righteous,
|    his ears are towards their cry for help.
|  [34:16] The LORD  sets his face against those who do evil,
|    to root their memory out of the earth.
|  [34:17] When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD,
|    and he saves them from all their distresses.
|  [34:18] The LORD  is near to the broken-hearted,
|    he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
|  [34:19] Many misfortunes befall the righteous,
|    but the LORD  delivers them out of them all.
|  [34:20] He guards all their bones,
|    none are broken.
|  [34:21] Misfortune will slay the ungodly;
|    those who hate the righteous are doomed.
|  [34:22] The LORD  ransoms the life of his servants,
|    and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.

 [Psalms 35] 

##### Psalm 35 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes #####

Of David.

|  [35:1] Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me,
|    do battle with those who do battle with me.
|  [35:2] Grasp shield and buckler,
|    and rise up as my help.
|  [35:3] Draw spear and battle-axe,
|    confront those who pursue me.
|    Assure me that you will help me.
|  [35:4] Dishonor and shame be on those
|    who are seeking my life!
|  Defeat and confusion on those
|    who are planning my hurt!
|  [35:5] As chaff before wind may they be,
|    with the LORD ’s angel pursuing them.
|  [35:6] Slippery and dark be their way,
|    with his angel thrusting them on.
|  [35:7] For they wantonly hid their net for me,
|    and dug a pit to destroy me.

|  [35:8] Upon them may ruin come unawares;
|  may the net which they hid catch themselves,
|    and into the pit may they fall.
|  [35:9] Then I will exult in the LORD,
|    and be joyful because of his help;
|  [35:10] and all my being will say,
|    “Who, O LORD, is like you,
|  who save the helpless from those too strong for them,
|    the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?”

|  [35:11] Violent witnesses rise,
|    and ask of me things that I know not.
|  [35:12] Evil for good they requite me,
|    leaving me inwardly comfortless.

|  [35:13] But when *they* were sick, *I* put on sackcloth,
|    and chastened myself with fasting.
|  I prayed with head bowed low,
|    [35:14] as if for my friend or my brother.
|  I went about bowed and in mourning,
|    as one who laments his mother.

|  [35:15] When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,
|    strangers gathered around me,
|    and tore at me without ceasing,
|  [35:16] impiously mocking and mocking,
|    bearing their teeth at me.

|  [35:17] How long, LORD, will you look on?
|    Rescue me from their roaring,
|    my precious life from the lions.
|  [35:18] I will then give you thanks in the great congregation,
|    and praise you before many people.
|  [35:19] Suffer not those to rejoice over me
|    who are falsely my foes,
|  suffer not those who without cause abhor me
|    to wink with the eye.

|  [35:20] For it is not peace that they speak
|    of those who are quiet in the land;
|  but treacherous charges they plot.
|    [35:21] With wide open mouths they shout,
|  “Hurrah! Hurrah!
|    With our own eyes we saw it.”

|  [35:22] But you have seen, too, O LORD,
|    keep not silence, O LORD,
|    be not far from me.
|  [35:23] Bestir you, awake, for my right
|    my God, my LORD, for my cause.

|  [35:24] You are just, LORD : win for me justice,
|    let them not rejoice over me,
|  [35:25] inwardly saying, “Hurrah!
|    The desire of our hearts at last!
|    Now we have swallowed him up.”
|  [35:26] Shame and confusion together
|    on those who rejoice at my hurt!
|  Clothed with shame and dishonor
|    be those who are haughty to me!

|  [35:27] Let such as delight in my cause
|  ring out their gladness,
|    and say evermore,
|  “Great is the LORD  whose delight
|    is the well-being of his servant.”
|  [35:28] Then my tongue will tell of your justice,
|    and all the day long of your praise.

 [Psalms 36] 

##### Psalm 36 – The Triumphant Power of God’s Love #####

For the leader. Of the servant of the 
LORD, of David.

|  [36:1] Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked,
|    who have no dread of God before their eyes.
|  [36:2] It flatters them in their eyes
|    that their sin will not be found out.

|  [36:3] First, their speech becomes wicked and false,
|    they give up acting wisely and well.
|  [36:4] Then they plot deliberate wrong,
|    take their stand on the wicked way,
|    without the least shrinking from evil.

|  [36:5] Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens,
|    your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
|  [36:6] Your justice is like the great mountains,
|    your judgments are like the broad sea.
|    LORD, you save people and animals.
|  [36:7] How precious your love, O God!
|    All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
|  [36:8] They feast on the fat of your house,
|    they drink of your brook of delights.
|  [36:9] For with you is the fountain of life,
|    in the light that is yours we see light.

|  [36:10] O continue your grace to the faithful,
|    your love to the upright in heart.
|  [36:11] Let no arrogant foot tread upon me,
|    no wicked hand drive me to exile.

|  [36:12] There the workers of wrong lie prostrate,
|    thrust down to rise up no more.

 [Psalms 37] 

##### Psalm 37 – Trust in the Lord and Do Good #####

Of David.

|  [37:1] Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked,
|    nor envious of those who work wrong;
|  [37:2] for, like grass, they will speedily wither,
|    and fade like the green of young grass.

|  [37:3] Trust in the LORD, and do good;
|    remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
|  [37:4] then the LORD  will be your delight,
|    he will grant you your heart’s petitions.

|  [37:5] Commit your way to the LORD ;
|    trust in him, and he will act,
|  [37:6] making clear as the light your right,
|    and your just cause clear as the noon-day.

|  [37:7] In silence and patience wait on the LORD .
|    Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper.
|    At those who execute evil devices.

|  [37:8] Desist from anger, abandon wrath:
|    be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
|  [37:9] for evildoers will be cut off,
|    but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD .

|  [37:10] Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish:
|    look at their place: they are there no more.
|  [37:11] But the humble will have the land,
|    and the rapture of peace in abundance.

|  [37:12] The wicked plots against the righteous,
|     snarls like a wild animal;
|  [37:13] the LORD  laughs,
|    for he sees that his day is coming.

|  [37:14] The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
|    to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
|  [37:15] but their sword will pierce their own heart,
|    and their bows will be broken in pieces.

|  [37:16] Better is the righteous person’s little
|    than the wealth of many wicked.
|  [37:17] For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
|    but the LORD  upholds the righteous.

|  [37:18] The LORD  watches over the days of the blameless,
|    their heritage will continue forever.
|  [37:19] They will not be shamed in the evil time,
|    in the days of famine they will be satisfied.

|  [37:20] Because the wicked will perish:
|  but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven,
|    will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.

|  [37:21] The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
|    but the righteous is lavish and gives.
|  [37:22] For those blest by the LORD  inherit the land,
|    while those whom he curses will be cut off.

|  [37:23] The LORD  supports the steps
|    of those with whom he is pleased.
|  [37:24] Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong,
|    for the LORD  holds their hands.

|  [37:25] Never, from youth to age,
|    have I seen the righteous forsaken,
|    or their children begging bread.
|  [37:26] They are ever lavishly lending,
|    and their children are fountains of blessing.

|  [37:27] Turn away from evil and do good
|    and you will live in the land forever.
|  [37:28] For the LORD  loves justice,
|    he does not forsake his friends.

|  The unrighteous will be destroyed forever,
|    and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
|  [37:29] But the land will belong to the righteous,
|    they will live upon it forever,

|  [37:30] The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
|    and words of justice are on their tongues.
|  [37:31] The law of their God is in their heart,
|    their steps are never unsteady.

|  [37:32] The wicked watches the righteous,
|    and seeks to put them to death.
|  [37:33] But the LORD  leaves them not in their hand:
|    at their trial they will not be held guilty.

|  [37:34] Wait on the LORD, and observe his way:
|    he will lift you to honor the land will be yours,
|    you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.

|  [37:35] I have seen the wicked exultant,
|    lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
|  [37:36] But the moment I passed, they vanished!
|    I sought for them, but they could not be found.

|  [37:37] Preserve your honor and practise uprightness,
|    for such a person fares well in the end.
|  [37:38] But transgressors will perish together.
|    Cut off are the wicked forever.

|  [37:39] The righteous are saved by the LORD,
|    who in time of distress is their refuge:
|  [37:40] the LORD  helps and rescue them,
|    from the wicked he rescues and saves them,
|    because they take refuge in him.

 [Psalms 38] 

##### Psalm 38 – A Confession and Prayer for Deliverance #####

A Psalm of David. A lament.

|  [38:1] Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger,
|    and chasten me not in your wrath;
|  [38:2] for your arrows have sunk into me,
|    and your hand lies heavy upon me.

|  [38:3] In my flesh is no soundness
|    because of your anger,
|  no health in my bones,
|    because of my sin.
|  [38:4] For that my guilt
|    is gone over my head:
|  it weighs like a burden
|    too heavy for me.

|  [38:5] My wounds stink and fester,
|    for my foolishness I am tormented.
|  [38:6] Bent and bowed am I utterly,
|    all the day going in mourning.

|  [38:7] My loins are filled with burning,
|    and in my flesh is no soundness.
|  [38:8] I am utterly crushed and numb;
|    I cry louder than lion roars.

|  [38:9] LORD, you know all that I long for,
|    my groans are not hidden from you.
|  [38:10] My heart is throbbing,
|    my strength has failed me.
|  The light of my eyes –
|    even it is gone from me.

|  [38:11] My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
|    and my neighbors stand afar off.
|  [38:12] They who aim at my life lay their snares,
|    they who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
|    nursing treachery all the day long.

|  [38:13] But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
|    like the dumb I open not my mouth.
|  [38:14] I am like one without hearing,
|    with no arguments in my mouth.

|  [38:15] For my hope, O LORD, is in you.
|    You will answer, O LORD  my God,
|  [38:16] when I utter the hope that those
|    who made scorn of my tottering feet
|    may not rejoice over me.

|  [38:17] For I am ready to fall,
|    my pain forsakes me never.
|  [38:18] I acknowledge my guilt,
|    I am anxious because of my sin:

|  [38:19] My wanton assailants are strong,
|    those who wrongfully hate me are many,
|  [38:20] who render me evil for good,
|    and oppose me, because I make good my goal.

|  [38:21] Do not forsake me, O LORD ;
|    my God, be not far from me.
|  [38:22] Hasten to help me,
|    O LORD  my savior.

 [Psalms 39] 

##### Psalm 39 – The Pathos of Life #####

For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|  [39:1] I vowed to watch my words,
|    and sin not with my tongue,
|  but to put on my mouth a muzzle,
|    while the wicked were in my presence.
|  [39:2] I was silent and dumb,
|    speechless:
|    but my pain was stirred up.
|  [39:3] My heart grew hot within me;
|    as I mused, the fire was kindled,
|    till at last the words came to my tongue.

|  [39:4] “Teach me, O LORD, my end,
|    and the sum of my days what it is.
|    Let me know how transient I am.
|  [39:5] See! My days you have made but a span,
|    and my life is as nothing before you.
|  It is but as a breath that everyone stands: *Selah*
|    [39:6] it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro,
|  and all our noise is for nothing.
|    We heap up, and know not who will gather.”

|  [39:7] And now, what wait I for, LORD ?
|    My hope is in you.
|  [39:8] From all my transgressions deliver me;
|    make me not the scorn of the fool.
|  [39:9] I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
|    for this is your own doing.
|  [39:10] Remove your stroke from off me:
|    by the might of your hand I am spent.
|  [39:11] When you rebuke someone to punish their sins,
|    you consume, like a moth, what they treasures.
|    Everyone is only a breath. *Selah*

|  [39:12] Hear my prayer, O LORD ;
|    attend to my cry for help.
|    Hold not your peace at my tears.
|  For I am but a guest of yours,
|    a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
|  [39:13] Look away from me, let me smile again,
|    before I die and am gone.

 [Psalms 40] 

##### Psalm 40 – Thanksgiving and Petition #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [40:1] For the LORD  I waited and waited,
|    till, inclining to me,
|    he heard my cry.
|  [40:2] From the horrible pit he drew me,
|    up out of the miry clay;
|  he set my feet on a rock,
|    and my steps he made firm.
|  [40:3] He put a new song in my mouth,
|    of praise to our God.
|  Many see it, and, filled with awe,
|    put their trust in the LORD .

|  [40:4] Happy the person who has put
|    in the LORD  their trust,
|  not looking to false gods
|    or turning to idols.
|  [40:5] With us you have wrought in rich measure,
|    O LORD  our God,
|  your marvels and purposes for us –
|    none may compare with you –
|  were I to declare or to tell them,
|    past counting are they.

|  [40:6] In offerings bloody or bloodless
|    you have no delight,
|  but with open ears you have made me.
|  Burnt-offering and offering for sin
|    are not what you ask.
|  [40:7] Then said I, “Here I am,
|    as the roll of the book has enjoined.
|  [40:8] My delight, O God, is to do your will,
|    and your law is within my heart.”
|  [40:9] Well, O LORD, you know
|    that, with lips unrestrained,
|  your righteousness I told
|    in the great congregation,
|  [40:10] not hiding it in my heart.
|    I have told of your steadfast help,
|  from the great congregation I hid not
|    your love and your faithfulness.
|  [40:11] So do not restrain, LORD,
|    your pity from us.
|  Your love and your faithfulness – ever
|    may they be our shield.

|  [40:12] For evils that cannot be numbered
|    have compassed me round.
|  My transgressions have followed me up –
|    I can bear it no more.
|  They are more than the hairs of my head,
|    and my heart has forsaken me.
|  [40:13] O LORD, be pleased to deliver me,
|    haste to my help, O LORD .
|  [40:14] May those who are seeking my life
|    be ashamed and confounded together;
|  may those who delight in my hurt
|    be defeated and brought to dishonor.
|  [40:15] May those who hurrah over me
|    be dumbfounded because of their shame.
|  [40:16] But may all who seek after you
|    rejoice and be glad in you.
|  May all those eager for your aid,
|    say, “Great is the LORD ” evermore.
|  [40:17] I am weak and needy,
|    yet the LORD  cares for me.
|  You are my help and deliverer;
|    don’t delay, my God.

 [Psalms 41] 

##### Psalm 41 – A Prayer for Healing and Vindication #####

For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|  [41:1] Happy are those who consider the weak;
|    in the day of misfortune the LORD  will deliver them.
|  [41:2] He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land,
|    and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
|  [41:3] The LORD  will sustain them on bed of languishing;
|    tending their sickness, as long as they lie.

|  [41:4] For this cause I say, “LORD, show me your favor;
|    heal me, because I have sinned against you.”
|  [41:5] My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
|    “When will he die, and his name pass away?”
|  [41:6] When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow;
|    their heart keeps gathering mischief the while;
|    and when they go out, they give it speech.
|  [41:7] In secret they whisper together against me,
|    all those who hate me plot evil against me.
|  [41:8] “Some fatal disease has fastened upon him;
|    and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.”
|  [41:9] My most trusted friend, on whom I relied,
|    who ate of my bread, has turned against me.

|  [41:10] But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up,
|    that I may pay them their due reward.
|  [41:11] By this will I know you delight in me:
|    if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
|  [41:12] For my innocence you uphold me,
|    and set me forever before your face.



|      [41:13] *Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,*
|      *from everlasting to everlasting,*
|      *Amen and Amen.*

 [Psalms 42] 

### Book Two ###

##### Psalm 42 – Yearning for God #####

For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.

|  [42:1] Like the hart which longs
|    for brooks of water,
|  I long
|    for you, God.

|  [42:2] I thirst for God,
|    for my living God.
|  When shall I enter in,
|    and see the face of God?
|  [42:3] My tears have been my food
|    by day and by night;
|  for they say to me all the day long,
|    “Where is your God?”

|  [42:4] My heart floods with sorrow,
|    as I call to mind:
|  how I used to pass on with the throng,
|    at their head, to the house of God,
|  with glad shouts and giving of thanks,
|    in the throng who kept festival.

|  [42:5] Why am I downcast?
|    Why this moaning within me?
|  Hope in God;
|    for yet will I praise him,
|    my help, my God.

|  [42:6] I am sunk in my misery;
|    I will therefore call you to mind
|  from the land of Jordan and Hermon,
|    the mountain Mizar.
|  [42:7] Flood is calling to flood
|    at the noise of your cataracts;
|  all your waves and your breakers
|    have passed over me.

|  [42:8] In the day I cry to the LORD
|     to summon his kindness;
|  and the song that I sing in the night
|    is a prayer to the living God.
|  [42:9] I say to God my rock,
|    “Why have you forgotten me?
|  Why must I walk so sadly,
|    so hard pressed by the foe?”
|  [42:10] It pierces me to the heart
|    to hear the enemy’s taunts,
|  as all the day long they say to me,
|    “Where is your God?”

|  [42:11] Why am I downcast?
|    Why this moaning within me?
|  Hope in God;
|    for yet will I praise him,
|    my help, my God.

 [Psalms 43] 

##### Psalm 43 – Plea for Help #####

|  [43:1] Right me, defend my cause
|    against a pitiless people.
|  From the crafty and crooked,
|    O God, deliver me.
|  [43:2] For you are God my protector:
|    why have you cast me off?
|  Why must I walk so sadly,
|    so hard pressed by the foe?
|  [43:3] Send forth your light and your truth,
|    let them be my guides:
|  to your holy hill let them bring me,
|    to the place where you live.
|  [43:4] Then will I go to God’s altar,
|    to God my rejoicing;
|  and with joy on the lyre I will praise you,
|    O God, my God.

|  [43:5] Why am I downcast?
|    Why this moaning within me?
|  Hope in God;
|    for yet will I praise him,
|    my help, my God.

 [Psalms 44] 

##### Psalm 44 – A Lament in Defeat #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.

|  [44:1] O God, we have heard with our ears,
|    all our ancestors have told us
|  of the work that you wrought in their day,
|    your wonders in days of old,
|  [44:2] uprooting and crushing the nations,
|    then planting and settling them.
|  For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
|    [44:3] it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
|  Yours was the hand and the arm,
|    yours was the face that shone on them with favor.
|  [44:4] It was you, my king and my God,
|    that ordained the victories of Jacob.

|  [44:5] Through you we can thrust back our foes,
|    and by your name tread down our assailants:
|  [44:6] for not in my bow do I trust,
|    nor can my sword win me the victory.
|  [44:7] Our victory comes from you,
|    and confusion to those who hate us.
|  [44:8] In God we boast all the day long,
|    and your name will we praise forever. *Selah*

|  [44:9] Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
|    in not going forth with our armies,
|  [44:10] and in making us flee from the foe,
|    so that those who hated us plundered us.
|  [44:11] You have let us be eaten like sheep,
|    you have scattered us over the world,
|  [44:12] sold your people for a pittance,
|    and getting no gain from their price.
|  [44:13] You have made us the butt of our neighbors,
|    the derision and scorn of all round us.
|  [44:14] O’er the world you have made us a byword,
|    the nations at us shake their heads.
|  [44:15] My disgrace is forever before me,
|    my face is covered with shame,
|  [44:16] at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
|    at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.

|  [44:17] All this has come upon us,
|    yet we have not forgotten you
|    nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
|  [44:18] Our heart has not turned back,
|    nor our steps declined from your way,
|  [44:19] that you thus should have crushed us down,
|    and covered us over with gloom,
|    in the place where the jackals roam.
|  [44:20] Had we forgotten the name of our God,
|    or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
|  [44:21] would God not have searched this out?
|    For he knows the heart and its secrets.
|  [44:22] But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
|    and counted as sheep for the slaughter.

|  [44:23] Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
|    Awake, cast us not off forever.
|  [44:24] Why do you hide your face,
|    forgetting our stress and our misery?
|  [44:25] For we have sunk down to the dust,
|    our bodies cling to the ground.
|  [44:26] Arise, come to our help:
|    for your love’s sake, ransom us.

 [Psalms 45] 

##### Psalm 45 – Song for the Marriage of a King #####

For the leader; on shoshannim. Of the Korahites. A maskil. A love song.

|  [45:1] My heart is astir with beautiful words:
|    I will sing a song, concerning the king,
|  with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.

|    [45:2] Your beauty is more than mortal,
|    grace is shed over your lips:
|  therefore God has blessed you forever.
|    [45:3] Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh.
|  What glory and splendor!

|    [45:4] Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride
|  in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice.
|    May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
|  [45:5] Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you:
|    pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.

|  [45:6] Your throne shall endure for ever and ever
|    your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
|  [45:7] Right you love and wrong you hate:
|    therefore the LORD  your God anoints you
|    With oil of gladness above your fellows.

|  [45:8] With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant,
|    you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
|  [45:9] King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you,
|    at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.

|  [45:10] Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
|    forget your folk and your father’s house.
|  [45:11] And when the king desires your beauty,
|    bow to him, for he is your lord.
|  [45:12] So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
|    and the richest of people will do you homage.

|  [45:13] The king’s daughter is glorious altogether,
|    with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
|  [45:14] In many-coloured robes she is led to the king,
|    with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
|    [45:15] The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.

|  [45:16] May sons of yours take the place of your fathers,
|    whom you will make princes in all the land.
|  [45:17] Your name will I celebrate world without end,
|    so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.

 [Psalms 46] 

##### Psalm 46 – Our God is a Mighty Fortress #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song.

|  [46:1] God is our refuge and strength,
|    a very present help in trouble.
|  [46:2] So we have no fear, though earth should change,
|    and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
|  [46:3] Let its waters roar and foam,
|    let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
|  On our side is the LORD  of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. *Selah*

|  [46:4] A river there is, whose streams make glad
|    God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
|  [46:5] God is within her: she cannot be shaken.
|    God helps her at the turn of the morning.
|  [46:6] Nations roared, kingdoms tottered:
|    he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
|  [46:7] On our side is the LORD  of hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob.

|  [46:8] Come and see what the LORD  has done,
|    working appallingly in the earth.
|  [46:9] He stills wars to the ends of the earth –
|    breaking the bow, snapping the spear,
|    burning the chariots in the fire.
|  [46:10] “Refrain; and know surely that I am God,
|    high over the nations, high over the world.”
|  [46:11] On our side is the LORD  of Hosts,
|    our sure defence is the God of Jacob. *Selah*

 [Psalms 47] 

##### Psalm 47 – The Lord’s Universal Sovereignty #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

|  [47:1] Clap your hands, all you peoples:
|    shout to God in ringing cries.
|  [47:2] For the LORD  is most high and dread,
|    a great king over all the earth.

|  [47:3] He subdues the peoples under us,
|    the nations under our feet;
|  [47:4] he chooses our heritage for us,
|    the glory of Jacob whom he loves. *Selah*

|  [47:5] God is gone up with a shout,
|    the LORD  with the sound of a trumpet.
|  [47:6] Sing praise to our God, sing praises:
|    sing praise to our king, sing praises.

|  [47:7] For king of all earth is he:
|    praise God in a skilful song.
|  [47:8] God is king over all the nations,
|    God sits on his holy throne.

|  [47:9] Princes of nations gather
|    with the people of Abraham’s God:
|  for the shields of the earth are God’s;
|    greatly exalted is he.

 [Psalms 48] 

##### Psalm 48 – The Marvelous Deliverance of Zion #####

A song. A psalm of the Korahites.

|  [48:1] Great is the LORD  and worthy all praise
|    in the city of our God.
|  His holy mountain,[48:2] that rises so fair,
|    is the joy of all the world.
|  Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion,
|    the city of the great king.

|  [48:3] Once God made himself known
|    as the defence of her palaces.
|  [48:4] For see! A concert of kings
|    passed over the frontier together.
|  [48:5] But one glance, and they were astounded;
|    they hastened away in dismay.
|  [48:6] Trembling took hold of them there,
|    like the pains of a woman in labor.
|  [48:7] They were shattered, as east wind shatters
|    the giant ships in pieces.
|  [48:8] What we heard, we now have seen
|    in the city of the LORD  of hosts,
|  the city of our God.
|    God will uphold her forever. *Selah*

|  [48:9] We think, O God, of your love,
|    in the midst of your temple.
|  [48:10] Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend
|    to the ends of the earth.
|  Victory fills your hand.
|    [48:11] Let mount Zion be glad;
|  let the daughters of Judah rejoice
|    because of your judgments.
|  [48:12] Walk about Zion, go round her;
|    count her towers.
|  [48:13] Set your mind on her ramparts,
|    consider her palaces;
|  that you tell to the next generation
|    [48:14] That such is God,
|  our God he it is who shall guide us
|    for ever and ever.

 [Psalms 49] 

##### Psalm 49 – The Problem of the Prosperity of the Wicked #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

|  [49:1] Hear this, you peoples all;
|    give ear, all you who live in the world
|  [49:2] people of low degree and high,
|    the rich and the poor together.
|  [49:3] My mouth shall utter wisdom,
|    the thoughts of a seeing heart.
|  [49:4] I incline my ear to a proverb,
|    on the lyre I will open my riddle.

|  [49:5] Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
|    when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
|  [49:6] who put their trust in their wealth,
|    and boast of their boundless riches?

|  [49:7] For assuredly no one can ransom themselves,
|    or give to God the price of their life,
|  [49:8] for the ransom of a life is costly,
|    no payment is ever enough,
|  [49:9] to keep them alive for ever and ever,
|    so as never to see the pit at all.

|  [49:10] But see it they will. Even wise people die,
|    the fool and the brutish perish alike,
|    and abandon their wealth to others.
|  [49:11] The grave is their everlasting home,
|    the place they shall live in for ever and ever,
|    though after their own names they called whole lands.
|  [49:12] Despite their wealth,
|    they perish like dumb animals.

|  [49:13] This is the fate of the confident fool,
|    and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. *Selah*
|  [49:14] Like sheep they descend to Sheol
|    with Death for their shepherd;
|  down they go straight to the grave,
|    and their form wastes away in their home below.

|  [49:15] But God will assuredly ransom my life
|    from the hand of Sheol;
|    for he will receive me. *Selah*
|  [49:16] So be not afraid when someone grows rich,
|    when the wealth of their house increases.
|  [49:17] Not a shred of it all can they take when they die,
|    wealth cannot follow them down.
|  [49:18] Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive,
|    and win praise from many for faring so well,
|  [49:19] they must join their ancestors,
|    who see the light nevermore.
|  [49:20] The wealthy are without understanding,
|    they perish like dumb animals.

 [Psalms 50] 

##### Psalm 50 – True Worship #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|  [50:1] The LORD  God has spoken: He summons the earth
|    from sunrise to sunset.
|  [50:2] From Zion, perfection of beauty,
|    God’s glory shines forth.
|  [50:3] Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
|  devouring fire is before him,
|    and furious tempest around him.
|  [50:4] He summons the heavens above
|    and the earth to judge his people.
|  [50:5] Gather to him his saints
|    by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
|  [50:6] that the heavens may declare his justice,
|    for a God of justice is he. *Selah*

|  [50:7] “Hear, O my people, and I will speak,
|    and protest to you, O Israel:
|    I am the LORD, your God.
|  [50:8] Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
|    your burnt-offerings are ever before me
|  [50:9] Not a bullock will I take from your house,
|    nor he-goats out of your folds;
|  [50:10] for all beasts of the forest are mine,
|    and the kine on a thousand hills.
|  [50:11] I know all the birds of the air,
|    all that moves on the fields is mine.
|  [50:12] Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
|    for the world and its fulness are mine.
|  [50:13] Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh,
|    or drink the blood of goats?
|  [50:14] Offer to God a thank-offering,
|    pay the Most High your vows.
|  [50:15] Summon me in the day of distress,
|    I will rescue you, so will you honor me.”

|  [50:16] But to the wicked God says:
|    “What right have you to talk of my statutes,
|    or take my covenant into your mouth
|  [50:17] while you yourself hate correction,
|    and cast my words behind you?
|  [50:18] When you see a thief, you run with them;
|    with adulterers you keep company.
|  [50:19] You let your mouth loose for evil,
|    your tongue contrives deceit.
|  [50:20] You shamefully speak of your kin,
|    and slander your own mother’s son.
|  [50:21] And because I kept silence at this,
|    you did take me for one like yourself.
|    But I will convict you and show you plainly.

|  [50:22] “Now you who forget God, mark this,
|    lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
|  [50:23] Those who bring a thank-offering honor me;
|    but to those: who follows my way,
|    I will show the salvation of God.”

 [Psalms 51] 

##### Psalm 51 – God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner #####

For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.

|  [51:1] In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
|    in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
|  [51:2] Wash me clean of my guilt,
|    make me pure of my sin.

|  [51:3] For well I know my transgressions,
|    my sin is ever before me.
|  [51:4] Against you, only you, have I sinned,
|    and done that which is wrong in your sight:
|  you therefore are just when you speak,
|    and clear when you utter judgment.
|  [51:5] See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
|    and in sin did my mother conceive me.
|  [51:6] It’s the innermost truth you desire,
|    give me therefore true wisdom of heart.

|  [51:7] Purge me clean with hyssop,
|    wash me whiter than snow.
|  [51:8] Fill me with joy and gladness,
|    let the bones you have broken rejoice.
|  [51:9] Hide your face from my sins,
|    and blot out my guilt altogether.

|  [51:10] Create me a clean heart, O God,
|    put a new steadfast spirit within me.
|  [51:11] Cast me not forth from your presence,
|    withdraw not your holy spirit.
|  [51:12] Give me back the joy of your help,
|    with a willing spirit sustain me.

|  [51:13] I will teach your ways to transgressors,
|    and sinners shall turn to you.
|  [51:14] Save me from blood, O God,
|    and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
|  [51:15] Open my lips, O LORD,
|    and my mouth shall declare your praise.

|  [51:16] For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
|    in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
|  [51:17] The sacrifice pleasing to God
|    is a spirit that is broken;
|  a heart that is crushed, O God,
|    you will not despise.

|  [51:18] Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
|    build the walls of Jerusalem.
|  [51:19] Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
|    then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

 [Psalms 52] 

##### Psalm 52 – The Doom of Arrogance #####

For the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech’s house.

|  [52:1] Why glory in mischief, you hero?
|    God’s kindness is all the day.
|  [52:2] Engulfing ruin you plot,
|    your tongue like a razor sharpened,
|    you practiser of deceit.
|  [52:3] Evil, not good, you love,
|    and falsehood, not words of truth. *Selah*
|  [52:4] But you love all words that devour,
|    and a tongue that is given to deceit.

|  [52:5] But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever,
|    grasp you and pluck you out of your tent,
|    and root you out of the land of the living. *Selah*
|  [52:6] Smitten with awe at the sight,
|    the righteous shall laugh at you.
|  [52:7] “Look” (they will say) “at the hero
|    who did not make God his stronghold,
|  but trusted in his great wealth
|    and in the strength of his riches.”

|  [52:8] But I am like a fresh olive-tree
|    in the house of God.
|  I trust in the kindness of God
|    for ever and evermore.
|  [52:9] I will render you thanks for ever
|    for what you have done.
|  I will tell how good you are
|    in the presence of those who love you.

 [Psalms 53] 

##### Psalm 53 – The Folly of Denying God #####

For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.

|  [53:1] Fools say in their heart,
|    “There is no God.”
|  Vile, hateful their life is;
|    not one does good.

|  [53:2] From heaven God looks out
|    on humans, to see
|  if any are wise,
|    and care for God.

|  [53:3] But all have turned bad,
|    the taint is on all;
|  not one does good,
|    no, not one.

|  [53:4] Have they learned their lesson,
|    those workers of evil?
|  Who ate up my people,
|    eating, devouring,
|    never calling to the LORD .

|  [53:5] Sore afraid will they be,
|    where no fear was;
|  when God scatters the bones
|    of the godless people.
|  They will be put to shame,
|    when God rejects them.

|  [53:6] If only help from Zion
|    would come for Israel!
|  When God brings his people
|    a change of fortune,
|  how glad will be Jacob,
|    and Israel how joyful!

 [Psalms 54] 

##### Psalm 54 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Oppression #####

For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, ‘David is in hiding among us’.

|  [54:1] Save me, O God, by your name,
|    by your power secure for me justice.
|  [54:2] Listen, O God, to my prayer,
|    give ear to the words of my mouth.
|  [54:3] For proud men have risen against me,
|    and terrible men seek my life,
|    men who do not set God before them. *Selah*

|  [54:4] But see! God is my helper,
|    the LORD  is sustaining my life.
|  [54:5] Let their evil fall back on my foes:
|    cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD .

|  [54:6] Then will I bring you glad sacrifice,
|    praising your gracious name;
|  [54:7] for from all distress you have saved me,
|    and feasted my eyes on my foes.

 [Psalms 55] 

##### Psalm 55 – Betrayed by a Friend #####

For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.

|  [55:1] Listen, God, to my prayer.
|    Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
|  [55:2] Hear me, and answer;
|    for bitter is my lament.
|  [55:3] I am wild with the noise of the foe,
|    with the clamor of the ungodly;
|  for they hurl disaster upon me,
|    and attack me with fury.
|  [55:4] My heart shudders within me,
|    terrors of deaths press on me,
|  [55:5] fear and trembling attack me,
|    and horror wraps me round.
|  [55:6] O for the wings of a dove:
|    I would fly away and rest.
|  [55:7] I would wander far away,
|    find refuge in the wilderness. *Selah*
|  [55:8] I would find myself a shelter
|    from raging wind and tempest.

|  [55:9] Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans;
|    for I see violence and strife in the city.
|  [55:10] By day and by night they make their rounds
|    on the city walls,
|  while within is crime and trouble,
|    [55:11] within is ruin.
|  Her market-place is never free
|    of deceit and tyranny.

##### The Treacherous Friend #####

|  [55:12] The taunts were not those of a foe
|    that I could have borne;
|  the disdain was not that of an enemy
|    I could have shunned them:
|  [55:13] but it was you, my equal,
|    my dear and familiar friend.
|  [55:14] We used to be so close,
|    together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.
|  [55:15] May death suddenly take them,
|    may they go down to Sheol alive,
|    for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.

|  [55:16] But I will call on God,
|    the LORD  will save me.
|  [55:17] Evening and morning and noon
|    I lament and moan.
|  He will hear my voice;
|    [55:18] though I am attacked by many
|  he will rescue me,
|    unharmed from the war.
|  [55:19] God, who sits on his ancient throne
|    will hear and will humble them,
|  for they never change,
|    they never fear God. *Selah*

|  [55:20] My friend turned against me,
|    betrayed his word.
|  [55:21] His mouth was smoother than butter,
|    but war filled his heart.
|  His words were softer than oil,
|    but sharper than swords.
|  [55:22] Cast your burden on the LORD,
|    and he will sustain you.
|  He will never let the righteous
|    be shaken.
|  [55:23] But you, God, will hurl them down
|    to the deepest pit.
|  Bloody and treacherous people
|    will not live out half their days;
|    but I will trust you.

 [Psalms 56] 

##### Psalm 56 – A Prayer of Trust in God #####

For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

|  [56:1] O God, be gracious to me,
|    for people trample upon me,
|    all the day righting and pressing me.
|  [56:2] All the day enemies trample me;
|    many there be
|    who contend with me bitterly.
|  [56:3] In the day of my terror
|    I trust in you.
|  [56:4] In God I maintain my cause,
|    in God I fearlessly trust.
|    What can flesh do to me?

|  [56:5] They torture me all the day,
|    they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
|  [56:6] banded together in secret,
|    watching my every step,
|    as those who hope for my death.
|  [56:7] Pay them out for their sin, O God,
|    hurl down the strong in your anger.
|  [56:8] You yourself count my wanderings.
|    Put in your bottle my tears
|    are they not in your book?
|  [56:9] Then shall my foes be turned back
|    in the day that I call.
|  Of this I am sure,
|    because God is for me.
|  [56:10] In God I maintain my cause,
|    in the LORD  I maintain my cause.
|  [56:11] In God I fearlessly trust,
|    what can people do to me?

|  [56:12] Your vows are upon me, O God,
|    I will render thank-offerings to you;
|  [56:13] because you have saved me from death,
|    my feet from stumbling,
|  to the end that I walk before God
|    in the light of the living.

 [Psalms 57] 

##### Psalm 57 – A Prayer for Protection from Persecution #####

For the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave.

|  [57:1] Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me,
|    for in you I take shelter.
|  In your sheltering wings I take refuge,
|    till ruin be over past.
|  [57:2] I cry to the Most High God,
|    to the God who accomplishes for me.
|  [57:3] He will send me his succour from heaven,
|    he will thrust away those who would trample me. *Selah*
|  [57:4] In the midst of lions I lie,
|    who devour human prey.
|  Their teeth are spears and arrows,
|    and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
|  [57:5] Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
|    and your glory o’er all the earth.

|  [57:6] They set a net for my feet,
|    but in it was their own foot caught.
|  Before me they dug a pit,
|    but they fell into it themselves. *Selah*

|  [57:7] My heart is steadfast, O God,
|    my heart is steadfast.
|  I would sing, I would make music;
|    [57:8] awake, my soul.
|  Awake, harp and lyre;
|    I would wake the dawn.
|  [57:9] I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD,
|    and make music among the nations to you;
|  [57:10] for great to heaven is your love,
|    and your faithfulness to the clouds.
|  [57:11] Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
|    and your glory o’er all the earth.

 [Psalms 58] 

##### Psalm 58 – A Prayer for Vengeance on Unjust Judges #####

For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam.

|  [58:1] Do you speak what is right, you gods?
|    With equity judge you your people?
|  [58:2] In the land you practise iniquity – all of you;
|    violence do you dispense with your hands.
|  [58:3] The wicked go astray from the womb
|    liars take the wrong path from their birth.
|  [58:4] Venom have they like the venom of snakes,
|    they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
|  [58:5] and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer,
|    or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.

|  [58:6] O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth,
|    tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD .
|  [58:7] May they melt away like running water!
|    Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
|  [58:8] Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path,
|    like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
|  [58:9] Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots,
|    he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
|  [58:10] The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous;
|    their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
|  [58:11] People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded:
|    yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”

 [Psalms 59] 

##### Psalm 59 – A Prayer for Safety #####

For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.

|  [59:1] Save me, O God, from my enemies;
|    secure me from my assailants.
|  [59:2] Save me from those who do wrong,
|    save me from the bloodthirsty.
|  [59:3] For see! They lay ambush for me,
|    strong men are banded against me
|  not for sin or transgression of mine,
|    for no guilt of mine, O LORD,
|  [59:4] they run and make ready. Awake!
|    Come forth to meet me, and see!
|  [59:5] You, O LORD  of hosts,
|    God of Israel, awake!
|  And punish the proud, every one;
|    spare none of the traitors vile. *Selah*

|      [59:6] At evening they come,
|      and, howling like dogs,
|      make their round in the city.
|  [59:7] Look at their venomous mouths,
|    tongues like swords,
|  they think no one
|    hears them.
|  [59:8] But you, LORD, laugh at them,
|    you mock all the insolent.
|  [59:9] My strength, I will sing to you,
|    for God is my sure retreat.
|  [59:10] My God with his love will meet me,
|    and feast my eyes on my foes.

|  [59:11] Slay them not, lest my people forget,
|    let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
|  [59:12] In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD ;
|    and may they be trapped in their pride,
|  for the curses and lies that they utter.
|    [59:13] In your wrath make a clean end of them,
|  that people, to the ends of the earth,
|    may know that God rules in Jacob. *Selah*

|      [59:14] At evening they come,
|      and, howling like dogs,
|      make their round in the city.
|  [59:15] They roam about for a feast,
|    and snarl, if they get not their fill.
|  [59:16] But I will sing of your might;
|    I will ring out your love in the morning.
|  For to me you have been a sure refuge,
|    a retreat in the day of my trouble.
|  [59:17] My strength, I will sing praise to you,
|    for God is my sure retreat,
|    my faithful God.

 [Psalms 60] 

##### Psalm 60 – A Prayer after Defeat in Battle #####

For the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

|  [60:1] O God, you have spurned and broken us,
|    routing us in your wrath – restore us!
|  [60:2] You have shaken the land and cleft it;
|    heal its tottering breaches.
|  [60:3] You have made your people drink hardship,
|    and given us wine of reeling.

|  [60:4] You have given those who fear you a banner,
|    a rallying-place from the bow, *Selah*
|  [60:5] for the rescue of your beloved.
|    Save by your right hand and answer us.

|  [60:6] God did solemnly swear:
|    “As victor will I divide Shechem,
|    and mete out the valley of Succoth.
|  [60:7] Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
|    Ephraim is the defence of my head,
|    Judah my sceptre of rule,
|  [60:8] Moab the pot that I wash in,
|    Edom – I cast my shoe over it,
|    I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”

|  [60:9] O to be brought to the fortified city!
|    O to be led into Edom!
|  [60:10] Have you not spurned us, O God?
|    You do not march forth with our armies.
|  [60:11] Grant us help from the foe,
|    for human help is worthless.
|  [60:12] With God we shall yet do bravely:
|    he himself will tread down our foes.

 [Psalms 61] 

##### Psalm 61 – Our God is a Strong Tower #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. Of David.

|  [61:1] Hear my cry, O God,
|    be attentive to my prayer.
|  [61:2] From the ends of the earth I call
|    unto you, when my heart is faint:
|  lead me to the rock
|    that is high above me.
|  [61:3] For you are a refuge to me,
|    a strong tower in face of the foe.

|  [61:4] O to be guest in your tent forever,
|    hiding beneath your sheltering wings! *Selah*
|  [61:5] For you, O God, do hear my vows,
|    and grant the desires of those who fear you.
|  [61:6] Add many days to the life of the king;
|    may his years endure throughout all generations.
|  [61:7] In the presence of God be he throned forever;
|    may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
|  [61:8] And I will sing praise to your name forever,
|    paying my vows day after day.

 [Psalms 62] 

##### Psalm 62 – Quietness and Confidence #####

For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David.

|  [62:1] I wait alone in silence for God;
|    From him comes my help.
|  [62:2] Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
|    I shall not be shaken too sorely.
|  [62:3] How long will you, all of you, batter a man,
|    as one might a leaning wall?
|  [62:4] From his height
|    they are planning to topple him.
|  They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth,
|    but inwardly they curse. *Selah*

|  [62:5] I wait alone in silence for God;
|    for from him comes my hope.
|  [62:6] Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
|    I shall not be shaken too sorely.
|  [62:7] On God rests my honor and safety,
|    in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
|  [62:8] Trust in him, all you people assembled,
|    pour out your heart in his presence;
|    God is a refuge for us. *Selah*

|  [62:9] The lowly are nought but a breath,
|    the lofty are but an illusion:
|  in the balances up they go,
|    they are lighter than breath altogether.
|  [62:10] Trust not in gain of extortion,
|    set no vain hopes in robbery.
|  As for wealth, if it bears fruit,
|    set not your heart upon it.

|  [62:11] One thing God has uttered,
|    two things there are which I heard
|  that power belongs to God,
|    [62:12] and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness;
|  for you requite each person
|    according to what they have done.

 [Psalms 63] 

##### Psalm 63 – Athirst for God #####

A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

|  [63:1] O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
|    my heart thirsts for you,
|  my body faints for you
|    in a parched and waterless land.

|  [63:2] As I in the temple have seen you,
|    beholding your power and your glory,
|  [63:3] for better than life is your kindness:
|    my lips shall utter your praise.

|  [63:4] So, while I live, I will bless you,
|    and lift up my hands in your name.
|  [63:5] As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
|    with joyful lips I will praise you.

|  [63:6] I call you to mind on my bed,
|    and muse on you in the night watches;
|  [63:7] for you have been my help,
|    I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
|  [63:8] I cling close after you,
|    your right hand holds me up.

|  [63:9] But those who seek after my life
|    shall go down to the depths of the earth,
|  [63:10] given o’er to the power of the sword,
|    or as prey for jackals to devour.

|  [63:11] But the king shall rejoice in God:
|    all who own his allegiance will glory.
|    For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.

 [Psalms 64] 

##### Psalm 64 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes #####

For the leader. A psalm of David.

|  [64:1] Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
|    guard my life from the foe who affrights me.
|  [64:2] Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
|    from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
|  [64:3] who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
|    and aimed bitter words like arrows,
|  [64:4] which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
|    shooting swiftly and unafraid.

|  [64:5] They strengthen their wicked purpose,
|    they tell of the snares they have hidden,
|    they say to themselves, “Who can see?”
|  [64:6] They think out their crimes full cunningly
|    hidden deep in their crafty hearts.

|  [64:7] But God with his arrow will shoot them,
|    swiftly shall they be smitten.
|  [64:8] For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
|    all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.

|  [64:9] Then every person, touched to awe,
|    as they ponder what God has wrought,
|    will tell the tale of his deeds.
|  [64:10] In the LORD  shall the righteous rejoice,
|    in him shall they take refuge;
|    and all the true-hearted shall glory.

 [Psalms 65] 

##### Psalm 65 – Hymn for a Thanksgiving Festival #####

For the leader. A psalm of David. A song.

|  [65:1] It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion,
|    and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
|  [65:2] O you who hear prayer,
|    unto you shall all flesh come.
|  [65:3] Our sins are too mighty for us,
|    our transgressions you only can cover them.
|  [65:4] Happy the person who you choose
|    to live beside you in your courts.
|  O may we be filled with the joys
|    of your house, of your holy temple.

|  [65:5] In dread deeds you loyally answer us,
|    O God of our salvation,
|  whom all ends of the earth put their trust in,
|    and islands far away.
|  [65:6] By your strength you establish the hills,
|    you are armed with might;
|  [65:7] you still the roaring of seas,
|    and the turmoil of nations,
|  [65:8] so that those who live at earth’s bounds
|    are awed at your signs:
|  the lands of the sunrise and sunset
|    you make to ring with joy.

|  [65:9] You visit and water the earth;
|    you greatly enrich her
|  with the river of God, which is full of water.
|    You prepare the corn thereof,
|  [65:10] watering her furrows,
|    settling her ridges;
|  you make her soft with showers,
|    and bless what grows thereon.
|  [65:11] You crown the year with your goodness,
|    your chariot-tracks drip with fatness.
|  [65:12] The desert pastures are lush,
|    the hills greened with joy.
|  [65:13] The meadows are clothed with flocks,
|    the valleys are covered with corn;
|    they shout to each other and sing.

 [Psalms 66] 

##### Psalm 66 – Thanksgiving for National Deliverance #####

For the leader. A song. A psalm.

|  [66:1] Shout to God, all the earth,
|    [66:2] sing praise to his glorious name,
|    sing his glorious praise.
|  [66:3] Say to God, “How dread are your works,
|    so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
|  [66:4] All the earth does homage to you,
|    singing praises to you,
|    singing praise to your name.” *Selah*

|  [66:5] Come and see what God has done,
|    awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
|  [66:6] He turns the sea into dry land,
|    and people cross the river on foot.
|  Let us therefore rejoice in him,
|    [66:7] the mighty Ruler eternal,
|  whose eyes keep watch on the nations,
|    that no rebel lift up his head. *Selah*

|  [66:8] O bless our God, you peoples;
|    sound aloud his praise,
|  [66:9] who keeps us in life,
|    and keeps our feet from slipping.
|  [66:10] For you, God, have tested us,
|    have tried us, as silver is tried.
|  [66:11] You did bring us into prison,
|    and put chains upon us,
|  [66:12] you did let people ride over our head.
|    We went through fire and through water,
|    but you led us out to a spacious place.

|  [66:13] I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
|    I will pay to you my vows,
|  [66:14] which my open lips have uttered,
|    arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
|  [66:15] I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
|    with the odour of burning rams,
|    I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. *Selah*

|  [66:16] Come and hear my story
|    all who fear God –
|    of what he has done for me.
|  [66:17] For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
|    than his praise was under my tongue.
|  [66:18] Had I cherished sin in my heart,
|    the LORD  would never have listened.
|  [66:19] But assuredly God has listened,
|    and attended to my loud prayer.

|  [66:20] Blessed be God, who turned not aside
|    my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

 [Psalms 67] 

##### Psalm 67 – A Harvest Thanksgiving #####

For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

|  [67:1] Bless us, O God, with your favor,
|    let the light of your face fall upon us; *Selah*
|  [67:2] that the world may know your way,
|    and all nations your power to save.

|  [67:3] Let the peoples praise you, O God;
|    let the peoples all of them praise you.
|  [67:4] Let the nations ring out their joy;
|    for you govern the peoples with equity,
|    and guide the nations on earth. *Selah*
|  [67:5] Let the peoples praise you, O God,
|    let the peoples, all of them, praise you.

|  [67:6] The earth has yielded her increase
|    by the blessing of God, our God.
|  [67:7] May this blessing of ours win people to him
|    to all the ends of the earth.

 [Psalms 68] 

##### Psalm 68 – Victory #####

For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.

|  [68:1] God arises, his enemies scatter:
|    they who hate him flee before him.
|  [68:2] As smoke before wind is driven,
|    as wax melts before fire,
|    so before God vanish the wicked.
|  [68:3] But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence,
|    they exult with exceeding joy.

|  [68:4] Sing to God, make music to his name,
|    his name is the LORD, praise him who rides on the clouds,
|      and exult in his presence.
|  [68:5] Father of orphans, defender of widows,
|    is God in his holy abode.
|  [68:6] God brings home the lonely,
|    he leads forth the prisoner to comfort,
|    so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.

|  [68:7] God, when you went in front of your people
|    in your march through the desert, *Selah*
|  [68:8] earth shook, the heavens poured rain
|    at the presence of God, Sinai’s God
|  at the presence of God, Israel’s God.
|  [68:9] Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
|    restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
|  [68:10] A dwelling therein your people found:
|    in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.

|  [68:11] The LORD  spoke the glad tidings of victory,
|    a great army of women proclaim it:
|  [68:12] “Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
|    and the housewife divides the spoil:
|  [68:13] dove’s wings covered with silver
|    and pinions with shimmer of gold,
|    [68:14] set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”

|  [68:15] A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
|    a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
|  [68:16] You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
|    at the mountain which God has desired for his home
|    whereon the LORD  will live forever?
|  [68:17] The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
|    the LORD  came from Sinai, his holy place.
|  [68:18] You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
|    and gifts that you had received from the people.
|    The rebels shall live with the LORD  God.

|  [68:19] Blest be the LORD  who sustains us daily,
|    the God who is also our savior. *Selah*
|    [68:20] Our God is a God who is savior.
|  The ways of escape from death
|    are known to the LORD  God.
|  [68:21] Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
|    the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
|  [68:22] The LORD  said: “I will bring you home from Bashan,
|    home from the depths of the sea,
|  [68:23] that your feet you may bathe in blood,
|    and your dogs lick their share of the foe.”

|  [68:24] In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions,
|    processions in praise of my king and my God,
|  [68:25] with singers in front, and minstrels behind,
|    and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
|  [68:26] “You of the well-spring of Israel,
|    bless the LORD  God in the dance.”
|  [68:27] There, in front, is Benjamin the little,
|    the princes of Judah beside them,
|    the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.

|  [68:28] God, show your strength,
|    your godlike might,
|  as you did in the past,
|    [68:29] from your temple that crowns Jerusalem.
|  Kings shall bring tribute to you.
|    [68:30] Rebuke the beast of the reed,
|  the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples.
|    Trample down the lovers of lies.
|    Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
|  [68:31] May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil,
|    Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.

|  [68:32] Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth,
|    make melody to the LORD . *Selah*
|  [68:33] Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens.
|    See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
|  [68:34] Ascribe strength to the God over Israel,
|    whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
|  [68:35] Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place,
|    it is Israel’s God
|    who gives strength and might to his people.
|      Blessed be God.

 [Psalms 69] 

##### Psalm 69 – A Prayer for Deliverance and Vengeance #####

For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.

|  [69:1] Save me, O God; for the waters
|    are threatening my life.
|  [69:2] I am sunk in depths of mire,
|    where ground there is none.
|  I am come into deep deep waters,
|    the flood overwhelms me.
|  [69:3] I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
|    my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.

|  [69:4] More than the hairs of my head
|    are those who wantonly hate me.
|  More than my bones in number
|    are those who are falsely my foes.
|  That which I never robbed,
|    how am I then to restore?
|  [69:5] O God, you know my folly,
|    my guilt is not hidden from you.
|  [69:6] Through me let not any be shamed,
|    who wait for you, LORD  God of hosts.
|  Through me let not those be confounded
|    who seek you, O God of Israel.
|  [69:7] It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts,
|    and my face has been covered with shame;
|  [69:8] I became to my kindred a foreigner,
|    to my mother’s sons a stranger.

|  [69:9] It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
|    and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
|  [69:10] When I chastened myself with fasting,
|    they took occasion to taunt me.
|  [69:11] When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
|    they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
|  [69:12] Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
|    in the music of drunken songs.

|  [69:13] But I pray to you, LORD,
|    for a time of favor.
|  In your great love answer me;
|    with your loyal help, save me
|  [69:14] from sinking down in the mire.
|    Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
|  [69:15] that the rushing flood may not drown me,
|    that the deep may not swallow me up,
|    nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
|  [69:16] Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness,
|    turn to me in your great compassion.
|  [69:17] Hide not your face from your servant,
|    for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
|  [69:18] Draw near to me, redeem me;
|    because of my enemies, ransom me.

|  [69:19] You know how I am insulted;
|    in your sight are all my foes.
|  [69:20] Insult has broken my heart,
|    past cure are my shame and confusion.
|  For pity I looked – there was none!
|    And for comforters, but I found none.
|  [69:21] Poison they gave me for food,
|    and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.

|  [69:22] May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
|    and their peace-offerings be a snare.
|  [69:23] May their eyes be darkened and blind,
|    make them shake without ceasing.
|  [69:24] Pour your indignation upon them,
|    let your burning wrath overtake them.
|  [69:25] May their camp be a desolation,
|    in their tents be there none to live.
|  [69:26] For those whom you struck, they persecute,
|    and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
|  [69:27] Charge them with sin upon sin,
|    may they not be acquitted by you.
|  [69:28] From the book of life be they blotted,
|    may their names not be written with the righteous.

|  [69:29] Lift me, O God, by your help
|    above my pain and misery.
|  [69:30] Then will I praise God in song
|    and magnify him with thanksgiving,
|  [69:31] which shall please the LORD  better than ox,
|    or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
|  [69:32] The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
|    You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
|  [69:33] For the LORD  listens to the poor,
|    he does not despise his prisoners.

|  [69:34] Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
|    the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
|  [69:35] For God will bring help to Zion,
|    and build up the cities of Judah,
|    his people shall live there in possession.
|  [69:36] His servants’ children shall have it for heritage,
|    and those who love him shall live therein.

 [Psalms 70] 

##### Psalm 70 – A Cry for Help in Persecution #####

For the leader. Of David. For commemoration.

|  [70:1] Quickly, God, deliver me,
|    hasten to help me, LORD .
|  [70:2] May those who are seeking my life,
|    be ashamed and confounded.
|  [70:3] May those who delight in my hurt
|    be defeated and brought to dishonor.
|  [70:4] But may all who seek after you
|    rejoice and be glad in you.
|  May all who love your salvation
|    say, “Glory to God,” evermore.
|  [70:5] I am weak and needy:
|    make haste, God, to me.
|  You are my help and deliverer;
|    LORD, don’t delay.

 [Psalms 71] 

##### Psalm 71 – Forsake me not, when I am Old #####

|  [71:1] In you, O LORD, I take refuge,
|    let me never be put to shame.
|  [71:2] In your faithfulness save me and rescue me,
|    bend your ear to me and save me.
|  [71:3] Be to me a rock of defence,
|    a fortified house, to save me;
|    for my rock and my fortress are you.

|  [71:4] Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
|    from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
|  [71:5] For you, LORD, are my hope,
|    in whom from my youth I have trusted.
|  [71:6] On you have I leaned from my birth;
|    from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me.
|    In you is my hope evermore.

|  [71:7] I have been as a wonder to many,
|    for you are my refuge and strength.
|  [71:8] All the day long my mouth
|    is filled with your praise and your glory.
|  [71:9] Cast me not off in the time of old age;
|    when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
|  [71:10] For my foes whisper against me,
|    they who watch me take counsel together;
|  [71:11] “God has left him,” they say: “pursue
|    and seize him, for he is helpless.”

|  [71:12] O God, be not far from me,
|    haste, O my God, to my help.
|  [71:13] Put my foes to shame and dishonor,
|    with insult and shame be they covered.
|  [71:14] But I will never stop hoping,
|    and more and yet more will I praise you.
|  [71:15] All the day long shall my mouth
|    tell your faithfulness and your salvation,
|    though I know not how they may be counted.

|  [71:16] I will tell of the might of the LORD,
|    and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
|  [71:17] You have taught me, O God, from my youth,
|    and till now have I told of your wonders.
|  [71:18] Even in old age and grey hair,
|    O God, do not forsake me.
|  Still would I tell of your might
|    unto all generations to come.

|  [71:19] Your power and your justice, O God,
|    extend as far as the heavens:
|  for great are the things you have done.
|    Who is like you, O God?
|  [71:20] You have caused us to see troubles many,
|    but you will revive us again.
|  From the depths of the earth
|    you will bring me up again.
|  [71:21] You will multiply my greatness,
|    and comfort me again.

|  [71:22] So with harp I will praise you,
|    and your faithfulness, O my God;
|  and make music to you on the lyre,
|    O you Holy One of Israel.
|  [71:23] My lips shall ring out their joy,
|    my mouth shall sing praises to you;
|    all of me, which you have redeemed.
|  [71:24] Yes, all the day long shall my tongue
|    utter your righteousness;
|  for ashamed and confounded are they
|    who were seeking my hurt.

 [Psalms 72] 

##### Psalm 72 – A Prayer for a Just and Glorious Reign #####

Of Solomon.

|  [72:1] Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
|    your spirit of right to the son of the king,
|  [72:2] that with right he may judge your people,
|    and your downtrodden ones with justice.

|  [72:3] May the mountains bear weal for the people,
|    and the hills yield fruits of justice.
|  [72:4] The weak may he help to their rights,
|    may he save the sons of the needy
|    and crush the oppressor in pieces.

|  [72:5] May he live as long as the sun,
|    while the moon shines – for ages and ages.
|  [72:6] May he be like the rain on the meadow,
|    like showers that water the earth.

|  [72:7] In his days may justice flourish,
|    and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
|  [72:8] May he reign from ocean to ocean,
|    from the river to the ends of the earth.

|  [72:9] May his foes bow down before him,
|    his enemies lick the dust.
|  [72:10] May tribute be rendered by kings
|    of the isles and of Tarshish;
|  may gifts be brought by the kings
|    of Sheba and Seba.

|  [72:11] May all kings fall prostrate before him,
|    and all nations yield him their service.
|  [72:12] For he saves the poor when he cries,
|    the helpless and the downtrodden.

|  [72:13] He pities the weak and the poor,
|    he saves the lives of the poor.
|  [72:14] He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
|    for dear is their blood in his sight.

|  [72:15] Long may he live;
|    and may gold of Sheba be given him;
|  prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly,
|    all the day long may men bless him.

|  [72:16] May the land have abundance of corn,
|    to the tops of the hills may it wave.
|  May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon,
|    may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.

|  [72:17] May his name be blessed forever,
|    may his fame endure as the sun.
|  May all nations envy his blessedness,
|    all tribes of the earth call him happy.



|      [72:18] *Blest be the LORD  God, Israel’s God,*
|      *who alone does wonders;*
|      [72:19] *And blest be forever his glorious name.*
|      *Let all the earth be filled with his glory.*
|      *Amen and Amen.*

|      [72:20] Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

 [Psalms 73] 

### Book Three ###

##### Psalm 73 – Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|  [73:1] Yes, God is good to the upright,
|    the LORD  to the pure in heart.
|  [73:2] But my feet were almost gone,
|    my steps had nearly slipped,
|  [73:3] through envy of godless braggarts,
|    when I saw how well they fared.

|  [73:4] For never a pang have they,
|    their body is sound and sleek.
|  [73:5] They have no trouble like mortals,
|    no share in human pain.
|  [73:6] So they wear their pride like a necklace,
|    they put on the garment of wrong,
|  [73:7] their eyes stand out with fatness,
|    their heart swells with riotous fancies.
|  [73:8] Their speech is mocking and evil,
|    condescending and crooked their speech.
|  [73:9] They have set their mouth in the heavens,
|    while their tongue struts about on the earth.
|  [73:10] Small wonder that people resort to them,
|    and drink deep draughts of their lore.
|  [73:11] “How does God know?” they say,
|    “And has the Most High any knowledge?”
|  [73:12] See! These are the godless,
|    with wealth and ease ever increasing.

|  [73:13] Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
|    and washed my hands in innocence;
|  [73:14] for all the day long was I plagued
|    not a morning but I was chastised.
|  [73:15] But to resolve to speak like they do
|    would be treachery to your children.

|  [73:16] So I sought to understand it,
|    but a wearisome task it seemed:
|  [73:17] till I entered the holy world of God
|    and saw clearly their destiny.

|  [73:18] Yes, you set them on slippery places;
|    down to destruction you hurl them.
|  [73:19] One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
|    They are finished and ended in terrors.
|  [73:20] Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
|    whose phantoms the waker despises.

|  [73:21] So my bitterness of mind
|    and the pain that stabbed my heart
|  [73:22] show how dull I was and stupid
|    just like a beast before you.

|  [73:23] But I am always with you,
|    you have hold of my right hand.
|  [73:24] By a plan of yours you guide me
|    and will afterward take me to glory.

|  [73:25] Whom have I in the heavens but you?
|    And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
|  [73:26] Though flesh and heart waste away,
|    yet God is the rock of my heart,
|    yet God is my portion forever.

|  [73:27] For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
|    you destroy all who are false to you.
|  [73:28] But I am happy when close to God;
|    the LORD  my God I have made my refuge,
|    that I may recount all the things you have done.

 [Psalms 74] 

##### Psalm 74 – Lament on the Devastation of the Temple #####

A maskil of Asaph.

|  [74:1] Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
|    Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
|  [74:2] Remember the community you purchased of old
|    to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage,
|    Zion, the mountain you made your home.
|  [74:3] Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
|    In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.

|  [74:4] Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
|    replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
|  [74:5] hacking, like woodsmen who lift
|    axes on thickets of trees,
|  [74:6] smashing with hatchets and hammers
|    all of its carved work together.
|  [74:7] They have set your temple on fire,
|    to the very ground they have outraged
|    the place where lives your name.
|  [74:8] They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.”
|    They have burned all the houses of God in the land.

|  [74:9] No symbol of ours do we see any more:
|    no prophet is there any more,
|    none is with us who knows how long.
|  [74:10] How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
|    Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
|  [74:11] Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand,
|    why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?

|  [74:12] Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
|    in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
|  [74:13] It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
|    and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
|  [74:14] It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
|    and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
|  [74:15] It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
|    it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
|  [74:16] Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
|    it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
|  [74:17] It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
|    summer and winter it’s you who have made them.

|  [74:18] Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD,
|    and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
|  [74:19] Do not give your dove to the beasts,
|    do not forget your afflicted forever.
|  [74:20] Look to the sleek ones – how full they are:
|    the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
|  [74:21] O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
|    let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.

|  [74:22] Arise, God, and defend your cause:
|    remember how fools all the day insult you.
|  [74:23] Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
|    the din of your foes that ascends evermore.

 [Psalms 75] 

##### Psalm 75 – God the Judge #####

For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

|  [75:1] We praise you, God, we praise you:
|    we would call on your name and declare your wonders.

|  [75:2] “At the time I choose,
|    I will judge fairly.
|  [75:3] Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
|    it is I who keep steady her pillars.” *Selah*
|  [75:4] I say to the boasters, “Boast not”;
|    to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:
|  [75:5] lift not your horn on high,
|    speak not boldly against the Rock.”

|  [75:6] For not from east nor west,
|    not from desert nor mountains;
|  [75:7] but God himself is the judge,
|    humbling one and exalting another.

|  [75:8] In the hand of the LORD  is a cup
|    foaming wine, richly spiced.
|  Out of this he pours a draught,
|    and all the wicked of earth
|    must drain it down to the dregs.

|  [75:9] But I will rejoice forever,
|    singing praise to the God of Jacob.
|  [75:10] I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
|    but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

 [Psalms 76] 

##### Psalm 76 – A Song of Victory #####

For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

|  [76:1] God has made himself known in Judah,
|    his name is great in Israel.
|  [76:2] His tent is in Salem,
|    his dwelling in Zion.

|  [76:3] There he broke the lightning arrows,
|    shield, sword, and weapons of war. *Selah*
|  [76:4] Terrible is your splendor
|    on the everlasting mountains.

|  [76:5] Despoiled were the stout of heart;
|    in the sleep into which they had fallen,
|  none of the warriors
|    could lift a hand.

|  [76:6] At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
|    sank chariot and horse to sleep.
|  [76:7] Awful are you: who can stand
|    before you, when once you are angry?

|  [76:8] The judgment you gave from heaven
|    frightened the earth into silence,
|  [76:9] when God arose to judgment
|    to save the oppressed of the earth. *Selah*

|  [76:10] The fiercest will praise you,
|    to you will the remnant hold festival.
|  [76:11] Vow and pay to LORD  your God,
|    and let all who are round him bring presents.

|  [76:12] He lops off the courage of princes,
|    and with terror fills kings of the earth.

 [Psalms 77] 

##### Psalm 77 – A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old #####

For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.

|  [77:1] Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
|    loudly to God, so he hears to me.
|  [77:2] In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD ;
|    in the night I lift my hands in prayer,
|    refusing all comfort.

|  [77:3] When I think of God, I moan;
|    when I muse, my spirit is faint. *Selah*
|  [77:4] When you hold my eyes awake,
|    and I am restless and speechless,
|  [77:5] I think of the days of old,
|    call to mind distant years.
|  [77:6] I commune with my heart in the night,
|    I muse with inquiring spirit.
|  [77:7] “Will the LORD  cast us off forever,
|    will he be gracious no more?
|  [77:8] Has his love vanished forever?
|    Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
|  [77:9] Has God forgotten to be gracious,
|    or in anger withheld his compassion?” *Selah*

|  [77:10] Then I said, “This it is that grieves me,
|    that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
|  [77:11] I will think of the deeds of the LORD,
|    and remember your wonders of old.
|  [77:12] I will muse on all you have wrought,
|    and meditate on your deeds.
|  [77:13] Then your way, O God, was majestic:
|    what God was great as our God?
|  [77:14] You were a God who did marvels,
|    you did show your power to the world
|  [77:15] by your arm you rescued your people,
|    the children of Jacob and Joseph. *Selah*

|  [77:16] The waters saw you, O God.
|    The waters saw you and shivered;
|    to their depths they trembled.
|  [77:17] Clouds poured torrents of water,
|    thunder rolled in the sky,
|    your arrows sped to and fro.
|  [77:18] Loud was the roll of your thunder,
|    lightnings lit up the world.
|    Earth quaked and trembled.
|  [77:19] In your way, LORD, through the sea,
|    in your path through the mighty waters,
|    your footsteps were all unseen.
|  [77:20] You did guide your folk like a flock
|    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

 [Psalms 78] 

##### Psalm 78 – The Warnings of History #####

A maskil of Asaph.

|  [78:1] My people, give ear to my teaching:
|    bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
|  [78:2] as I open my mouth in a poem
|    on the riddling story of the past.

|  [78:3] What we have heard and known,
|    and what our ancestors have told us,
|  [78:4] we will not hide from their children.
|    We will tell to the next generation
|  the praises and might of the LORD,
|    and the wonders that he has done.

|  [78:5] He set up a testimony in Jacob,
|    a law he appointed in Israel,
|  which he commanded our ancestors
|    to make known to their children,
|  [78:6] that the next generation should know it,
|    that the children yet to be born
|  should arise and tell their children;
|    [78:7] that in God they might put their confidence,
|  and not forget God’s works;
|    but that they might keep his commandments,
|  [78:8] and not be like their ancestors,
|    a generation defiant and stubborn,
|  a generation with heart unsteady,
|    and spirit unfaithful towards God.

|  [78:9] Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
|    turned back in the day of battle.
|  [78:10] They did not keep God’s covenant,
|    they refused to walk in his law.
|  [78:11] They forgot what he had done,
|    and the wonders he had shown them.

|  [78:12] He did wonders before their ancestors
|    in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
|  [78:13] Through the sea which he split he brought them,
|    making waters stand up like a heap;
|  [78:14] he led them by day with a cloud,
|    all the night with a light of fire.

|  [78:15] From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
|    he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
|  [78:16] He brought streams out of the rock,
|    and made water run down like rivers.

|  [78:17] Yet they still went on sinning against him,
|    they defied the Most High in the desert.
|  [78:18] They willfully challenged God,
|    demanding the food that they longed for.
|  [78:19] “Is God able,” such was their challenge,
|    “to spread in the desert a table?
|  [78:20] From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
|    and torrents that overflowed;
|  but can he also give bread,
|    or provide his people with meat?”

|  [78:21] When the LORD  heard this, he was furious,
|    and fire was kindled on Jacob,
|    anger flared up against Israel.

|  [78:22] For they put no trust in God,
|    no confidence in his help.
|  [78:23] So he summoned the clouds above;
|    and, opening the doors of heaven,
|  [78:24] he rained manna upon them for food,
|    and grain of heaven he gave them.
|  [78:25] Everyone ate the bread of angels;
|    he sent them food to the full.

|  [78:26] He launched the east wind in the heavens,
|    and guided the south by his power.
|  [78:27] He rained meat upon them like dust,
|    winged bird like the sand of the sea.
|  [78:28] In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
|    all around their tents.

|  [78:29] They ate and were more than filled;
|    he had brought them the thing they desired.
|  [78:30] But the thing they desired became loathsome:
|    while their food was still in their mouths,
|  [78:31] the wrath of God rose against them.
|    He slew the stoutest among them,
|    and laid low the young men of Israel.

|  [78:32] Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
|    and refused to believe in his wonders.
|  [78:33] So he ended their days in a breath,
|    and their years in sudden dismay.
|  [78:34] When he slew them, then they sought after him,
|    they turned and sought God with diligence.

|  [78:35] They remembered that God was their rock,
|    and the Most High God their redeemer.
|  [78:36] But they flattered him with their mouth,
|    and lied to him with their tongue.
|  [78:37] Their heart was not steady with him,
|    they were faithless to his covenant.

|  [78:38] But he is full of pity:
|    he pardons sin and destroys not.
|  Often he turns his anger away,
|    without stirring his wrath at all.
|  [78:39] So he remembered that they were but flesh,
|    breath that passes and does not return.

|  [78:40] But how often they rebelled in the desert,
|    and caused him grief in the wilderness,
|  [78:41] tempting God again and again,
|    provoking the Holy One of Israel.
|  [78:42] They did not remember his strength,
|    nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
|  [78:43] how he set his signs in Egypt,
|    in the country of Zoan his wonders.

|  [78:44] He turned their canals into blood,
|    their streams undrinkable.
|  [78:45] He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
|    frogs, too, which destroyed them.
|  [78:46] Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
|    and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
|  [78:47] He slew their vines with hail,
|    and their sycamore trees with frost.
|  [78:48] He delivered their cattle to the hail,
|    and their flocks to bolts of fire.

|  [78:49] He let loose his hot anger among them,
|    fury and wrath and distress,
|    a band of destroying angels.
|  [78:50] He cleared a path for his anger,
|    did not spare them from death,
|    but gave them over to pestilence.

|  [78:51] He struck down all the first-born in Egypt,
|    the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
|  [78:52] He led forth his people like sheep,
|    he was guide to his flock in the desert.
|  [78:53] Securely he led them, and free from fear,
|    while their foes were drowned in the sea.

|  [78:54] To his holy realm he brought them,
|    to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
|  [78:55] He drove out the nations before them,
|    and allotted their land for possession,
|    and their tents for Israel to live in.

|  [78:56] Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
|    they did not observe his decrees.
|  [78:57] They drew back, false like their ancestors;
|    they failed like a treacherous bow.
|  [78:58] Their shrines stirred him to anger,
|    their idols moved him to jealousy.

|  [78:59] When God heard of this, he was furious,
|    and he spurned Israel utterly.
|  [78:60] He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
|    the tent he had pitched among people.
|  [78:61] He gave his strength up to captivity,
|    his glory to the hands of the foe.

|  [78:62] He gave his people to the sword,
|    he was furious with his own.
|  [78:63] Fire devoured their young men,
|    and their maidens had no marriage-song.
|  [78:64] Their priests fell by the sword,
|    and their widows could not weep.

|  [78:65] Then the LORD  awoke as from sleep,
|    like a warrior flushed with wine;
|  [78:66] and he beat back his foes,
|    putting them to perpetual scorn.
|  [78:67] He disowned the tent of Joseph,
|    he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
|  [78:68] but he chose the tribe of Judah,
|    Mount Zion, which he loves.
|  [78:69] And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
|    like the earth which he founded forever.

|  [78:70] And he chose David his servant,
|    taking him from the sheepfolds.
|  [78:71] From the mother-ewes he brought him,
|    to be shepherd to Jacob his people,
|    and to Israel his inheritance.
|  [78:72] With upright heart did he shepherd them,
|    and with skilful hands did he guide them.

 [Psalms 79] 

##### Psalm 79 – A National Prayer for Deliverance #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|  [79:1] Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
|    defiling your holy temple,
|    and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
|  [79:2] They have given the bodies of your dead servants
|    to the birds of the air to devour,
|    and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
|  [79:3] Round about Jerusalem
|    they have poured out their blood like water;
|    and there was no one to bury them.
|  [79:4] On every side our neighbors
|    revile us and mock us and jeer at us.

|  [79:5] How long will you be angry, O LORD ?
|    Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
|  [79:6] Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
|    on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
|  [79:7] For Jacob they devoured,
|    they have desolated his home.
|  [79:8] Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins;
|    O meet us soon with your pity,
|    for utterly weak are we.

|  [79:9] Help us, O God our savior,
|    for the renown of your name:
|  for your reputation deliver us
|    and cover over our sins.
|  [79:10] Why should the nations say,
|    “Where is their God?”
|  Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants
|    be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
|  [79:11] May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
|    free the children of death by your mighty arm.
|  [79:12] Pay our neighbors back sevenfold
|    for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD .

|  [79:13] Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
|    will give thanks to you for evermore,
|    and tell your praise to all generations.

 [Psalms 80] 

##### Psalm 80 – A Prayer for the Preservation of Israel #####

For the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm.

|  [80:1] Listen, Shepherd of Israel,
|    who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep;
|  from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
|    [80:2] before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.
|  Stir up your mighty power,
|    come to our help.
|  [80:3] God, restore us:
|    show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

|  [80:4] O LORD  of hosts,
|  how long is your anger to smoke,
|    despite the prayer of your people?
|  [80:5] You have fed them with bread of tears,
|    you have made them drink tears by the measure.
|  [80:6] The scorn of our neighbors you make us,
|    the laughing-stock of our foes.
|  [80:7] God of hosts, restore us:
|    show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

|  [80:8] A vine out of Egypt you brought;
|    you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
|  [80:9] in the ground you did clear she struck root,
|    and she filled all the land.
|  [80:10] The shade of her covered the mountains,
|    her branches the cedars of God.
|  [80:11] She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
|    and her branches as far as the River.
|  [80:12] Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
|    to be plucked at by all who pass by,
|  [80:13] to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
|    and devoured by the beasts of the field?

|  [80:14] O God of hosts, return:
|    look down from heaven and see
|  and visit this vine, and restore her
|    [80:15] the vine which your right hand has planted.
|  [80:16] She is burned with fire and cut down
|    before your stern face they are perishing.
|  [80:17] Support the one you have chosen,
|    the one you have raised for yourself;
|  [80:18] then from you we will never draw back.
|    Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
|  [80:19] LORD, God of hosts, restore us:
|    Show us the light of your face,
|    so we may be saved.

 [Psalms 81] 

##### Psalm 81 – For the Feast of Tabernacles #####

For the leader. On the gittith. Of Asaph.

|  [81:1] Sing aloud to God our strength,
|    shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
|  [81:2] Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
|    sweet lyre and harp.
|  [81:3] On the new moon blow the horn,
|    at the full moon, the day of our festival.
|  [81:4] For this is a statute for Israel,
|    a ruling of the God of Jacob,
|  [81:5] a witness he set up in Joseph,
|    when he marched against Egypt’s land,
|    where he heard an unknown voice say:

|  [81:6] “I removed from your shoulder the burden,
|    and freed your hands from the basket.
|  [81:7] At your call of distress I delivered you,
|    from the thundercloud I answered you.
|    At Meribah’s waters I tested you. *Selah*

|  [81:8] “Listen, my people, to my warning,
|    O Israel, if you would but listen!
|  [81:9] There must not be a strange god among you,
|    you must bow to no foreign god.
|  [81:10] I am the LORD  your God
|    who brought you up out of Egypt.
|    Open your mouth, that I fill it.

|  [81:11] “But my people did not listen to my voice,
|    Israel would have none of me.
|  [81:12] So to their own hard hearts I left them,
|    to follow their own devices.
|  [81:13] O that my people would listen,
|    that Israel would walk in my ways.
|  [81:14] Soon would I humble their enemies,
|    and turn my hand on their foes.
|  [81:15] Those who hate the LORD  would cringe before him
|    in everlasting terror.
|  [81:16] But you would I feed with the richest wheat,
|    and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.”

 [Psalms 82] 

##### Psalm 82 – God the Upholder of Justice #####

A psalm of Asaph.

|  [82:1] God has taken his stand
|    in the divine assembly:
|    in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
|  [82:2] “How long will you crookedly judge,
|    and favor the wicked? *Selah*
|  [82:3] Do right by the weak and the orphan,
|    acquit the innocent poor.
|  [82:4] Rescue the weak and the needy,
|    save them from the hand of the wicked.

|  [82:5] “They have neither knowledge nor insight,
|    in darkness they walk to and fro,
|    while the earth’s foundations totter.
|  [82:6] It was I who appointed you gods,
|    children of the Most High all of you.
|  [82:7] Yet like mortals you will surely die,
|    you will fall like any prince.”

|  [82:8] Arise, O God, judge the earth,
|    for all nations are yours by inheritance.

 [Psalms 83] 

##### Psalm 83 – A Prayer for the Destruction of the Enemies of Judah #####

A song, a psalm of Asaph.

|  [83:1] Do not keep silent, O God:
|    hold not your peace, be not still, God.
|  [83:2] For see! Your enemies roar,
|    those who hate you lift up their heads,
|  [83:3] laying crafty plans for your people,
|    and plotting against those you treasure.
|  [83:4] “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation,
|    so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”

|  [83:5] For, conspiring with one accord,
|    they have made a league against you
|  [83:6] Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites,
|    Moab, and the Hagrites.
|  [83:7] Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
|    Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
|  [83:8] Syria, too, is confederate,
|    they have strengthened the children of Lot. *Selah*

|  [83:9] Deal with them as you dealt with Midian,
|    with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
|  [83:10] who at Endor were destroyed,
|    and became dung for the field.
|  [83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
|    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
|  [83:12] who said, “Let us take for ourselves
|    the meadows of God.”

|  [83:13] Whirl them, my God, like dust,
|    like stubble before the wind.
|  [83:14] As the fire that kindles the forest,
|    as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
|  [83:15] so with your tempest pursue them,
|    terrify them with your hurricane.
|  [83:16] Make them blush with shame;
|    until they seek your name, O LORD .
|  [83:17] Everlasting shame and confusion,
|    disgrace and destruction be theirs.
|  [83:18] Teach those who you alone
|    are most high over all the earth.

 [Psalms 84] 

##### Psalm 84 – The Song of the Pilgrims #####

For the leader. On the gittith. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

|  [84:1] How dearly loved is the place where you live,
|    LORD  of hosts!
|  [84:2] How I long and yearn
|    for the courts of the LORD .
|  Now heart and flesh cry for joy
|    to the living God.

|  [84:3] Even the sparrow has found her a home
|    and the swallow a nest,
|  to lay her young,
|    near your altar,
|  LORD  of hosts,
|    my king and my God.
|  [84:4] Happy those who live in your house,
|    praising you evermore. *Selah*

|  [84:5] Happy those whose strength is in you,
|    people with pilgrim hearts.
|  [84:6] As they pass through the valley of tears,
|    they make it a place of fountains,
|    clothed with the blessings of early rain.
|  [84:7] From rampart to rampart on they march,
|    till at last God reveals himself in Zion.

|  [84:8] LORD, God of hosts, hear my prayer,
|    give ear, O God of Jacob. *Selah*
|  [84:9] Behold, O God, our defender,
|    and look upon your anointed,
|  [84:10] for better a single day in your courts
|    than a thousand in my own chambers:
|  better stand at the door of the house of my God
|    than live in the tents of ungodliness,
|  [84:11] for the LORD  is sun and shield,
|    the LORD  gives grace and glory.
|  He withholds no good thing from the life that is blameless.
|  [84:12] LORD  of hosts,
|    happy those whose trust is in you.

 [Psalms 85] 

##### Psalm 85 – A Prayer for National Restoration #####

For the leader. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

|  [85:1] Once, LORD, you did favor your land,
|    granting change of fortune to Jacob,
|  [85:2] forgiving the guilt of your people,
|    pardoning all their sin, *Selah*
|  [85:3] withdrawing all your fury,
|    turning from your hot anger.

|  [85:4] Restore us, O God our savior,
|    put away your displeasure against us.
|  [85:5] Will you cherish your anger against us forever,
|    prolonging your wrath to all generations?
|  [85:6] Will you not revive us again,
|    that your people may be glad in you?
|  [85:7] Show us your kindness, O LORD,
|    grant us your salvation.

|  [85:8] Let me hear what God the LORD  will speak;
|    for he will speak of peace
|  to his people, to those who love him,
|    and turn their hearts to him.
|  [85:9] Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves,
|    and glory shall live in our land.

|  [85:10] Kindness and loyalty meet;
|    peace and righteousness kiss.
|  [85:11] Loyalty springs from the earth;
|    righteousness looks from the sky.
|  [85:12] The LORD  shall give all that is good,
|    our land yielding its increase,
|  [85:13] righteousness marching before him,
|    and peace on the path he treads.

 [Psalms 86] 

##### Psalm 86 – A Prayer for Divine Guidance and Favor #####

A prayer of David.

|  [86:1] Incline your ear, LORD, and answer me,
|    for I am afflicted and needy.
|  [86:2] Guard me, for I am loyal:
|    save your servant, who trusts in you.
|  [86:3] LORD, be gracious to me, for you are my God;
|    I cry to you all the day.
|  [86:4] Gladden the heart of your servant;
|    for to you, LORD, I set my hope.
|  [86:5] For you, LORD, are good and forgiving,
|    rich in love towards all who call on you.

|  [86:6] Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
|    attend to my plea for mercy.
|  [86:7] In the day of my trouble I call on you,
|    with assurance that you will answer me.
|  [86:8] None of the gods is like you, LORD,
|    nor are any works like yours.
|  [86:9] All the nations you have made
|    will come and bow down before you,
|    giving glory, O LORD, to your name.
|  [86:10] For great are you, and a doer of wonders;
|    you alone are God.

|  [86:11] Teach me, O LORD, your way,
|    that I may walk in your truth:
|    so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
|  [86:12] I will give you thanks, O LORD,
|    with all my heart, my God,
|    I will honor your name forever.
|  [86:13] For great is your love towards me,
|    from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.

|  [86:14] Haughty men have risen up against me, O God,
|    a band of the violent seeking my life,
|    who think nothing of you.
|  [86:15] But you are a God of pity and grace,
|    patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness;
|    turn to me with your grace, O LORD .
|  [86:16] Grant your strength to your servant,
|    and save the child of your handmaid.
|  [86:17] Show me a sign of your favor,
|    which those who hate me may see with confusion,
|    since you, LORD, are my helper and comforter.

 [Psalms 87] 

##### Psalm 87 – Zion, City of God #####

Of the Korahites, a psalm. A song.

|  [87:1] On the holy mountain stands
|    the city he founded.
|  [87:2] The LORD  loves the gates of Zion
|    more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
|  [87:3] Glorious things he is speaking of you,
|    you city of God. *Selah*

|  [87:4] “Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon,
|    Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia,
|    their people will say I was born in Zion.
|  [87:5] As for Zion it will be said
|    each and all were born in her.”
|  The LORD  will preserve her.

|  [87:6] The LORD  will count, when enrolling the peoples,
|    “This one was born there, and that one was born there.” *Selah*
|  [87:7] Singers and dancers alike will say
|    “All my springs are in you.”

 [Psalms 88] 

##### Psalm 88 – The Prayer of Despair #####

|  [88:1] O LORD  my God,
|    I cry for help in the day-time,
|    in the night my cry is before you;
|  [88:2] let my prayer come into your presence,
|    incline your ear to my cry.

|  [88:3] For I am sated with sorrow,
|    my life draws near to Sheol.
|  [88:4] I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
|     without strength am I.

|  [88:5] My home is among the dead,
|    like the slain that lie in the grave,
|  whom you remember no more
|    cut off as they are from your hand.

|  [88:6] In the deepest pit you have put me,
|    in shadows deep and dark.
|  [88:7] Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
|    waves of your anger roll over me. *Selah*

|  [88:8] You have put my friends far from me,
|    you have made them shun me.
|  I am shut in, and cannot escape,
|    [88:9] my eyes are wasted with sorrow.
|  I call on you, LORD, every day,
|    spreading my hands out to you.

|  [88:10] For the dead can you work wonders?
|    Can the shades rise again to praise you? *Selah*
|  [88:11] Can your kindness be told in the grave,
|    your faithfulness in the tomb?
|  [88:12] Can your wonders be known in the darkness,
|    or your help in the land of forgetfulness?

|  [88:13] I cry for help to you,
|    in the morning my prayer comes before you.
|  [88:14] Why, O LORD, do you spurn me,
|    and hide your face from me?
|  [88:15] From my youth I am wretched and dying,
|    I am numbed by the terrors I bear.

|  [88:16] The fires of your wrath have passed over me,
|    your terrors destroy me,
|  [88:17] surging around me forever,
|    hemming me in altogether.
|  [88:18] Those who love me you put far from me;
|    the dark is my only friend.

 [Psalms 89] 

##### Psalm 89 – The Promise to David #####

A song. A psalm of the Korahites.

|  [89:1] I will sing evermore of the love of the LORD,
|    proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
|  [89:2] For your love you did promise to build up forever,
|    your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.

|  [89:3] “I have made with my chosen a covenant,
|    and sworn to David my servant,
|  [89:4] to establish his seed forever,
|    and to build up his throne to all ages.” *Selah*

|  [89:5] Then the holy assembly in heaven
|    praised your marvelous faithfulness, LORD .
|  [89:6] For who in the skies may compare with the LORD ?
|    Who is like the LORD  among the gods?

|  [89:7] A God to be feared in the holy assembly,
|    awful and great above all who are round him.
|  [89:8] O LORD  God of hosts, who is mighty as you?
|    Your strength and faithfulness, LORD, surround you.

|  [89:9] You are the LORD  of the raging sea:
|    when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
|  [89:10] It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces,
|    and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.

|  [89:11] Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth,
|    the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
|  [89:12] The north and the south, it’s you have created them;
|    Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.

|  [89:13] You have an arm with the might of a hero;
|    strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
|  [89:14] Justice and right are the base of your throne,
|    kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.

|  [89:15] Happy the people who know the glad shout,
|    who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face.
|  [89:16] They exult in your name all the day,
|    and your righteousness they extol.

|  [89:17] For you are our strength and our pride.
|    Your favor will lift us to honor.
|  [89:18] For the holy LORD  of Israel
|    keeps our defender and king.

|  [89:19] In a vision of old you did speak
|    in this way to the one whom you loved:
|  “A crown I have set on the hero
|    I chose to be over the people

|  [89:20] “I found my servant David,
|    and anointed with holy oil.
|  [89:21] My hand will be with him forever,
|    my arm will give him strength.

|  [89:22] “No enemy will dare to assail him,
|    nor the wicked to oppress him;
|  [89:23] but his foes I will shatter before him,
|    I will strike down those who hate him.

|  [89:24] “My loyal love shall attend him,
|    and I will lift him to honor.
|  [89:25] I will set his hand on the sea,
|    and his right hand on the rivers.

|  [89:26] “As for him, he will call me ‘My father,
|    my God, and my rock of salvation.’
|  [89:27] And I will make him my first-born,
|    highest of kings on the earth.

|  [89:28] “My love will I keep for him ever,
|    my covenant with him shall stand fast.
|  [89:29] His line will I make everlasting,
|    and his throne as the days of the heavens.

|  [89:30] “If his children forsake my law,
|    and walk not as I have ordained;
|  [89:31] if they profane my statutes,
|    and do not keep my commandments;

|  [89:32] “I will punish their sin with the rod,
|    their iniquity with scourges.
|  [89:33] But my love will I not take from him,
|    nor will I belie my faithfulness.

|  [89:34] “I will not profane my covenant
|    by changing the word that has passed my lips.
|  [89:35] Once have I solemnly sworn
|    and I would not lie to David,

|  [89:36] “that his line should endure forever,
|    and his throne as the sun before me,
|  [89:37] firm as the moon which for ever
|    and ever is fixed in the sky.” *Selah*

|  [89:38] But you have cast off in contempt,
|    and been furious with your anointed.
|  [89:39] You have spurned the covenant with your servant,
|    and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.

|  [89:40] You have broken down all his walls,
|    and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
|  [89:41] All who pass on their way despoil him,
|    the scorn of his neighbors is he now.

|  [89:42] You have given his foes the victory,
|    and made all his enemies glad.
|  [89:43] You have turned back his sword from the foe,
|    you did not lift him up in the battle.

|  [89:44] The sceptre you took from his hand,
|    and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
|  [89:45] You have shortened the days of his youth,
|    and covered him with shame. *Selah*

|  [89:46] How long, LORD  will you hide you forever?
|    How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
|  [89:47] Remember, LORD, the shortness of life
|    how fleeting you made all people.

|  [89:48] Who can live without seeing death?
|    Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? *Selah*
|  [89:49] Where, LORD, is your kindness of old,
|    which you in your faithfulness swore to David?

|  [89:50] Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked,
|    how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
|  [89:51] The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD,
|    which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.



|      [89:52] *Blest be the LORD, for ever and ever.*
|      *Amen and Amen.*

 [Psalms 90] 

### Book Four ###

##### Psalm 90 – Hymn of Eternity #####

A prayer of Moses, the man of God.

|  [90:1] LORD, you have been a home to us
|    one generation after another.
|  [90:2] Before the mountains were born,
|    or the earth and the world were brought forth,
|  from everlasting to everlasting
|    you are God.

|  [90:3] You bring us back to the dust,
|    you summon mortals to return.
|  [90:4] For you see a thousand years
|    as the passing of yesterday,
|    as a watch in the night.

|  [90:5] Your floods sweep them away;
|  they are like a dream,
|    or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
|  [90:6] which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
|    but by evening is cut and withered.

|  [90:7] For your anger consumes us,
|    the heat of your wrath confounds us.
|  [90:8] Our sins you have set before you,
|    our secrets in the light of your face.
|  [90:9] For through your wrath our days are declining,
|    we bring our years to an end as a sigh.

|  [90:10] The span of our life is seventy years,
|    or, if we are strong, maybe eighty;
|  yet is their breadth but empty toil,
|    for swiftly they go, and we fly away.

|  [90:11] Who lays to heart the power of your anger?
|    Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
|  [90:12] O teach us to count our days
|    so our minds may learn wisdom.

|  [90:13] Return, O LORD ; why so long?
|    Relent on your servants.
|  [90:14] Grant us your love to the full in the morning,
|    that all our days we may shout for joy.

|  [90:15] Make us glad for the days you have humbled us,
|    for the evil years we have seen.
|  [90:16] Let your servants see you in action,
|    show your majesty to their children.
|  [90:17] Let the grace of the LORD  our God be upon us,
|    uphold what our hands are striving to do.

 [Psalms 91] 

##### Psalm 91 – In the Shelter of the Most High #####

|  [91:1] You whose home is the shelter of God Most High,
|    whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
|  [91:2] can say to the LORD, “My refuge, my fortress,
|    my God, in whom I trust.”

|  [91:3] For he saves you from fowler’s snare,
|    from deadly plague,
|  [91:4] he shelters you with his pinions,
|    and under his wings you can hide.

|  His truth will be a shield and buckler.

|  [91:5] You need not fear the terror of night,
|    nor the arrow that flies by day,
|  [91:6] nor the plague that stalks in darkness,
|    nor the pestilence raging at noon.

|  [91:7] A thousand may fall at your side,
|    ten thousand at your right hand:
|  but it will not draw near to you.

|  [91:8] You will only look on with your eyes,
|    and see how the wicked are punished.
|  [91:9] You have made the LORD  your refuge,
|    you have made the Most High your defence.

|  [91:10] You will never be met by misfortune,
|    no plague will come near your tent,
|  [91:11] for he orders his angels to guard you,
|    wherever you go.

|  [91:12] They will carry you with their hands,
|    so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
|  [91:13] You will trample down lions and snakes,
|    tread on young lions and cobras.

|  [91:14] “Because of their love for me, I will deliver them,
|    I will protect those who trust my name.
|  [91:15] I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble,
|    bringing them forth into safety and honor.
|  [91:16] I will give them a life of many days,
|    I will show them my salvation.”

 [Psalms 92] 

##### Psalm 92 – The Ways of God #####

A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.

|  [92:1] It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
|    to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
|  [92:2] to declare your love in the morning,
|    and your faithfulness in the night,
|  [92:3] with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
|    with music that throbs on the lyre.
|  [92:4] For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD,
|    at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.

|  [92:5] How great are your works, O LORD ;
|    how deep are your thoughts!
|  [92:6] The insensitive cannot know,
|    nor can a fool understand,
|  [92:7] that, though the wicked flourish like grass,
|    and evil-doers all blossom,
|    they will perish forever.

|  [92:8] But you are exalted forever.
|  [92:9] For see! Your enemies, LORD
|     For see! Your enemies perish,
|    all evil-doers are scattered.
|  [92:10] But you lift me to honor,
|    and anoint me afresh with oil.
|  [92:11] My eyes will feast on my foes,
|    and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.

|  [92:12] The righteous will sprout like the palm,
|     will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
|  [92:13] In the house of the LORD  are they planted,
|    in the courts of our God they will sprout.
|  [92:14] They will still bear fruit in old age,
|    all sappy and fresh will they be
|  [92:15] So they proclaim the LORD  to be just,
|    my rock, in whom is no wrong.

 [Psalms 93] 

##### Psalm 93 – The Lord, King of all the World #####

|  [93:1] The LORD  has taken his seat on the throne,
|    clothed with majesty, armed with might.
|  Now the world stands firm, to be shaken no more,
|    [93:2] firm stands your throne from all eternity.
|      You are from everlasting.

|  [93:3] The floods, O LORD, have lifted,
|    the floods have lifted their voice,
|    the floods lift up their roar.
|  [93:4] But more grand than the great roaring waters,
|    more grand than the ocean waves,
|    grand on the height stands the LORD .

|  [93:5] What you have ordained is most sure;
|    most sure shall your house stand inviolate,
|    O LORD, for ever and ever.

 [Psalms 94] 

##### Psalm 94 – A Prayer for Vengeance on the Cruel #####

|  [94:1] LORD, God of vengeance,
|    God of vengeance, shine forth.
|  [94:2] Rise up, judge of the earth,
|    pay back the proud what they deserve.

|  [94:3] LORD, how long shall the wicked,
|    how long shall the wicked exult,
|  [94:4] with their blustering arrogant words,
|    their braggart and wicked speech,
|  [94:5] crushing your people, LORD,
|    and afflicting your heritage,
|  [94:6] murdering widows and strangers,
|    slaying the fatherless?
|  [94:7] They think that the LORD  does not see,
|    nor the God of Jacob regard it.

|  [94:8] Take heed, you dullest of people;
|    when will you be wise, you fools?
|  [94:9] Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
|    Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
|  [94:10] Can he who trains nations not punish them
|    he who teaches knowledge to people?
|  [94:11] The LORD  knows the thoughts of people,
|    that only a breath are they.

|  [94:12] Happy are those whom you chasten,
|    and teach out of your law,
|  [94:13] keeping them calm in the day of misfortune,
|    till a pit be dug for the wicked.

|  [94:14] For the LORD  will not leave his people,
|    he will not forsake his inheritance.
|  [94:15] For the righteous shall come to their rights,
|    and all true-hearted people shall follow them.

|  [94:16] Who will rise up for me against those who do evil?
|    Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
|  [94:17] Were it not for the help of the LORD,
|    I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
|  [94:18] When I thought that my foot was slipping,
|    your kindness, LORD, held me up.
|  [94:19] When with cares my heart was crowded,
|    your comforts make me glad.

|  [94:20] Can corrupt justice be your ally,
|    framing mischief by statute?
|  [94:21] They assail the life of the righteous,
|    and innocent blood condemn.
|  [94:22] But the LORD  is my sure retreat,
|    my God is the rock of my refuge.
|  [94:23] He will bring back their sin upon them,
|    for their wickedness he will destroy them;
|    the LORD  our God will destroy them.

##### Psalm 95 – For a Festival. A Hymn of Praise and a Solemn Warning #####

|    let us merrily shout to our rock of salvation.
|  [95:2] Before his face let us come with thanks,
|    with songs of praise let us shout to him.

|  [95:3] For the LORD  is a great God,
|    king above all gods.
|  [95:4] In his hand are the depths of the earth,
|    the heights of the mountains are his.
|  [95:5] The sea is his, for he made it:
|    the dry land was formed by his hands.

|  [95:6] Come! Let us worship and bow
|    on our knees to the LORD  our creator.
|  [95:7] For he is our God; and we
|    are the people he tends, the sheep in his care.

|  If only you would heed his voice today:
|  [95:8] “Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
|    or at Massah, that day in the desert,
|  [95:9] when your ancestors tempted and tried me,
|    though they had seen my deeds.

|  [95:10] “For forty years I was filled with loathing
|    for that generation, so I said:
|  ‘A people with wandering hearts are they,
|    and ignorant of my ways.’
|  [95:11] So I solemnly swore to them in my anger,
|    that never would they enter my place of rest.”

|    held in awe, above all gods:
|  [96:5] for all the gods of the nations are idols,
|    but the LORD  created the heavens.
|  [96:6] Before him are splendor and majesty,
|    beauty and strength in his holy place.

|  [96:7] Ascribe to the LORD, you tribes of the nations,
|    ascribe to the LORD  glory and strength.
|  [96:8] Ascribe to the LORD  the glory he manifests:
|    bring you an offering, enter his courts.
|  [96:9] Bow to the LORD  in holy array:
|    tremble before him, all the earth.

|  [96:10] Say to the nations, “The LORD  is king.”
|    The world stands firm to be shaken no more.
|    He will judge the peoples with equity.
|  [96:11] Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice,
|    let the sea and its fulness thunder.

|  [96:12] Let the field, and all that is in it, exult;
|    let the trees of the forest ring out their joy
|  [96:13] before the LORD : for he comes,
|    he comes to judge the earth.
|  He will judge the world with justice
|    and the nations with faithfulness.

|  [97:3] Fire goes before him,
|    and blazes around his steps,
|  [97:4] his lightnings illumine the world:
|    the earth quakes at the sight.
|  [97:5] Mountains melt like wax
|    before the LORD  of all the earth.
|  [97:6] The heavens proclaim his justice,
|    all nations behold his glory.

|  [97:7] Shamed are all image-worshippers,
|    who make a boast of their idols.
|    All the gods bow before him.
|  [97:8] Zion is glad at the tidings,
|    the towns of Judah rejoice
|    because of your judgments, LORD .
|  [97:9] For you are most high over all the earth,
|    greatly exalted above all gods.

|  [97:10] The LORD  loves those who hate evil,
|    he guards the lives of the faithful:
|    from the hand of the wicked he saves them.

|    and joy for the upright in heart.

|    justice and right you have wrought for Jacob.
|  [99:5] Exalt the LORD  our God,
|    bow down at his footstool.

|  [99:6] Among his priests were Moses and Aaron,
|    Samuel among those who called on his name.
|    They called to the LORD, and he gave them answer.
|  [99:7] He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud,
|    they kept his commands and the statute he gave them.
|    [99:8] LORD  our God, you gave them answer.
|  A God of forgiveness were you to them,
|    who suffered their deeds to go unpunished.
|  [99:9] Exalt the LORD  our God;
|    bow down at his holy mountain.
|      For holy is the LORD  our God.

 [Psalms 101] 

##### Psalm 101 – A Model King #####

Of David, a psalm.

|  [101:1] If kindness and justice I sing,
|    making melody to you, LORD .
|  [101:2] I would look to the way that is blameless,
|    and make it my own.

|  Within my own house I would walk
|    with an innocent heart.
|  [101:3] I would never direct my eyes
|    to a thing that is base.

|  The impulse to stray I abhor
|    it shall not cling to me.
|  [101:4] Far from me be perverseness of heart,
|    or kinship with evil.

|  [101:5] Who slanders their neighbor in secret,
|    I bring them to silence:
|  haughty looks and proud hearts
|    I will not abide.

|  [101:6] I will favor the true in the land,
|    they shall live in my court.
|  Those who walk in a way that is blameless
|    will be my attendant.

|  [101:7] No one will live in my house
|    who practises guile.
|  No one that speaks a lie
|    will abide in my presence.

|  [101:8] Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out
|    all the bad in the land,
|  and cut off from the LORD ’s own city
|    all workers of evil.

 [Psalms 102] 

##### Psalm 102 – A Prayer for Pity and for the Restoration of Zion #####

|  [102:1] Hear my prayer, O LORD ;
|    let my cry for help come to you.
|  [102:2] Hide not your face from me
|    in the day of my distress.
|  Incline your ear to me:
|    when I call, answer me speedily.

|  [102:3] For my days pass away like smoke:
|    my bones are burned through as with fire.
|  [102:4] My heart is scorched, withered like grass;
|    I forget to eat my bread.
|  [102:5] By reason of my loud groaning,
|    my flesh clings to my bones.

|  [102:6] Like a desert-owl of the wilderness,
|    like an owl among ruins am I.
|  [102:7] I make my sleepless lament
|    like a bird on the house-top alone.
|  [102:8] All the day wild foes revile me,
|    using my name for a curse.

|  [102:9] For ashes have been my bread,
|    and tears have been mixed with my cup.
|  [102:10] Because of your passionate anger,
|    you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
|  [102:11] My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,
|    I wither like grass.

|  [102:12] But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever,
|    your fame endures to all generations.
|  [102:13] You will arise and have pity on Zion;
|    it’s time to be gracious; her hour has come.
|  [102:14] For even her stones are dear to your servants,
|    even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.

|  [102:15] Then the nations will revere the name of the LORD
|     and all the kings of the earth his glory,
|  [102:16] when the LORD  shall have built up Zion,
|    and revealed himself in his glory,
|  [102:17] in response to the prayer of the destitute,
|    whose prayer he will not despise.

|  [102:18] Let this be recorded for ages to come,
|    that the LORD  may be praised by a people yet unborn.
|  [102:19] For he shall look down from his holy height,
|    from the heavens the LORD  will gaze on the earth,
|  [102:20] to hear the groans of the prisoner,
|    to free those who are doomed to die;
|  [102:21] that people may recount the LORD ’s fame in Zion,
|    and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
|  [102:22] when the nations are gathered together,
|    and the kingdoms, to worship the LORD .

|  [102:23] He has broken my strength on the way,
|    he has shortened my days.
|  [102:24] I will say, “My God, take me not hence
|    in the midst of my days.

|  “Your years endure age after age.
|    [102:25] Of old you have founded the earth,
|    and the heavens are the work of your hands.
|  [102:26] They shall perish; but you do stand.
|    They shall all wax old like a garment,
|    and change as a robe you will change them.
|  [102:27] But you are the same, your years are endless.
|    [102:28] The children of your servants abide,
|    evermore shall their seed be before you.”

 [Psalms 103] 

##### Psalm 103 – Bless the Lord, O my Soul #####

Of David.

|  [103:1] O my soul, bless the LORD ;
|    and all that is in me, his holy name.
|  [103:2] O my soul, bless the LORD ;
|    and forget not one of his benefits.
|  [103:3] He pardons all your sins,
|    he heals all your diseases.
|  [103:4] He ransoms your life from the pit,
|    he crowns you with kindness and pity.
|  [103:5] He gives you your heart’s desire,
|    renewing your youth like the eagle’s.

|  [103:6] The LORD  executes justice –
|    and right for all who are wronged.
|  [103:7] He revealed his ways to Moses,
|    his acts to the children of Israel.
|  [103:8] Full of pity and grace is the LORD,
|    patient, and rich in kindness:
|  [103:9] he will not always chide,
|    nor cherish his anger forever.
|  [103:10] Not after our sins has he dealt with us,
|    nor requited us after our wickedness.

|  [103:11] For high as the heavens o’er the earth
|    is his love over those who fear him.
|  [103:12] Far as is east from the west
|    has he put our transgressions from us.
|  [103:13] As a father pities his children,
|    so the LORD  pities those who fear him;
|  [103:14] for well he knows our frame,
|    he remembers that we are dust.

|  [103:15] A person’s days are as grass;
|    blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
|  [103:16] At the breath of the wind it is gone,
|    and the place thereof knows it no more.
|  [103:17] But the love of the LORD  is eternal,
|    and his kindness to children’s children,
|  [103:18] to those who keep his covenant
|    and mindfully do his behests.

|  [103:19] The LORD  has set his throne in the heavens;
|    the whole world is under his sway.
|  [103:20] Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
|    mighty heroes performing his word.
|  [103:21] Bless the LORD, all you his hosts,
|    you servants who do his will.
|  [103:22] Bless the LORD, all you his works,
|    far as his sway extends.
|    O my soul, bless the LORD .

 [Psalms 104] 

##### Psalm 104 – The Hymn of Creation #####

|  [104:1] Bless the LORD, O my soul.
|  O LORD  my God, you are very great,
|    clad in awful splendor,
|    [104:2] covered with robe of light.
|  You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
|    [104:3] He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
|  He takes dark clouds for his chariot,
|    and rides on the wings of the wind.
|  [104:4] He takes the winds for his messengers,
|    the fire and the flame for his servants.

|  [104:5] He founded the earth upon pillars,
|    to sustain it unshaken forever.
|  [104:6] With the garment of ocean he covered it,
|    waters towered over the mountains.
|  [104:7] But at your rebuke they fled,
|    scared by the roar of your thunder,
|  [104:8] mountains rose, valleys sank down
|    to the place appointed for them.
|  [104:9] They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
|    or cover the earth any more.

|  [104:10] He sent brooks into the valleys,
|    they meander between the mountains.
|  [104:11] The wild beasts all drink from them,
|    and the wild asses quench their thirst.
|  [104:12] The birds have their home by the banks,
|    and sing in the branches.
|  [104:13] From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
|    and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.

|  [104:14] He makes grass grow for the cattle,
|    and herbs for people.
|  He brings bread out of the earth;
|    [104:15] wine, to gladden hearts;
|  oil, to make faces shine;
|    bread, to strengthen hearts.
|  [104:16] The trees of the LORD  drink their fill
|    the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
|  [104:17] where the little birds build their nest,
|    and the stork whose home is the cypress.
|  [104:18] The high hills are for the wild goats,
|    and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.

|  [104:19] He created the moon to mark seasons,
|    and told the sun when to set.
|  [104:20] You make it dark: night comes,
|    when all the wild beasts creep out.
|  [104:21] Young lions that roar for their prey,
|    seeking their meat from God.
|  [104:22] At sunrise they slink away,
|    and lie down in their dens.
|  [104:23] Then people go forth to their work,
|    and toil till evening.

|  [104:24] How many, O LORD, are your works,
|    all of them made in wisdom!
|    The earth is filled with your creatures.
|  [104:25] And there is the great broad sea,
|    where are countless things in motion,
|    living creatures, both great and small.
|  [104:26] There go the ships,
|    and the Leviathan you made to play there.

|  [104:27] They all look in hope to you,
|    to give them their food in due season.
|  [104:28] And you give with open hand;
|    they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
|  [104:29] When you hide your face, they are terrified;
|    when you take their breath away,
|    they die and go back to their dust.
|  [104:30] But a breath from your lips creates them,
|    and renews the face of the earth.

|  [104:31] May the glory of the LORD  be forever,
|    may the LORD  rejoice in his works.
|  [104:32] A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
|    a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
|  [104:33] I will sing to the LORD  while I live,
|    I will play to my God while I am.
|  [104:34] May my musing be sweet to him,
|    for I rejoice in the LORD .
|  [104:35] But may sinners be swept from the earth,
|    and the wicked vanish forever.
|    O my soul, bless the LORD .
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 105] 

##### Psalm 105 – The Inspiration of the Past #####

|  [105:1] Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name:
|    make known his deeds among the nations.
|  [105:2] Sing to him, make music to him,
|    tell of all his wondrous works.
|  [105:3] Make your boast in his holy name,
|    be glad at heart, you who seek the LORD .
|  [105:4] Seek after the LORD  and his strength,
|    seek his face evermore.
|  [105:5] Remember the wonders he did,
|    his portents, the judgments he uttered,
|  [105:6] you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
|    the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

|  [105:7] He is the LORD  our God:
|    in all the earth are his judgments.
|  [105:8] He remembers forever his covenant,
|    his promise for a thousand generations
|  [105:9] The covenant he made with Abraham,
|    the oath he swore to Isaac,
|  [105:10] and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
|    a pact everlasting to Israel
|  [105:11] to give them the land of Canaan
|    as the lot which they should inherit.

|  [105:12] And when they were very few,
|    few and but pilgrims therein,
|  [105:13] wandering from nation to nation,
|    journeying from people to people,
|  [105:14] he allowed no one to oppress them,
|    even punishing kings for their sakes.
|  [105:15] He forbade them to touch his anointed,
|    or do any hurt to his prophets.

|  [105:16] When he called down famine on the land,
|    and cut off the bread which sustained them,
|  [105:17] he sent before them a man,
|    Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
|  [105:18] His feet were galled with fetters,
|    he was laid in chains of iron,
|  [105:19] till the time that his word came to pass,
|    the word of the LORD  that had tried him.

|  [105:20] The king sent and freed him,
|    the ruler of nations released him.
|  [105:21] He made him lord of his household,
|    and ruler of all his possessions,
|  [105:22] to admonish his princes at will
|    and instruct his elders in wisdom.

|  [105:23] Thus Israel came into Egypt,
|    Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
|  [105:24] His people he made very fruitful,
|    and mightier than their foes.
|  [105:25] He inspired them to hate his people,
|    and to deal with his servants craftily.

|  [105:26] He sent his servant Moses,
|    and Aaron whom he had chosen,
|  [105:27] portents he wrought in Egypt,
|    and signs in the land of Ham.
|  [105:28] Darkness he sent, and it fell:
|    yet they gave no heed to his word.

|  [105:29] He turned their waters into blood,
|    thus causing their fish to die.
|  [105:30] Their land was alive with frogs,
|    swarming even in the royal chambers.
|  [105:31] At his command came flies,
|    and lice in all their borders.
|  [105:32] He gave them hail for rain
|    and fire that flashed through the land,
|  [105:33] smiting their vines and figs,
|    breaking the trees of their border.

|  [105:34] At his command came locusts,
|    young locusts beyond all counting,
|  [105:35] which ate every herb in the land,
|    ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
|  [105:36] He struck down in their land all the first-born,
|    the firstlings of all their strength
|  [105:37] Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
|    and among his tribes no one was weary.

|  [105:38] Egypt was glad when they left,
|    for terror had fallen upon them.
|  [105:39] He spread out a cloud to screen them,
|    and fire to give light in the night.
|  [105:40] He sent quails at their entreaty,
|    and heavenly bread in abundance.
|  [105:41] He opened the rock; waters gushed:
|    in the desert they ran like a river.
|  [105:42] For he remembered his holy promise
|    to Abraham his servant.

|  [105:43] So he led out his people with joy,
|    his elect with a ringing cry.
|  [105:44] And he gave them the lands of the nations,
|    the fruit of their toil for possession,
|  [105:45] that so they might keep his statutes,
|    and be of his laws observant.
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 106] 

##### Psalm 106 – The Nation’s Sin against the Lord #####

|      [106:1] Hallelujah!

|  Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness,
|    for his kindness endures forever.
|  [106:2] Who can describe his heroic deeds,
|    or publish all his praise?
|  [106:3] Happy they who act justly,
|    and do righteousness evermore.

|  [106:4] Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people,
|    and visit me with your gracious help.
|  [106:5] May I see the good fortune of your elect,
|    may I share in the joy of your nation,
|    and in the pride of your heritage.

|  [106:6] We, like our fathers, have sinned,
|    we have done perversely and wickedly
|  [106:7] In the land of Egypt our fathers,
|    all heedless of your wonders,
|  and unmindful of your great kindness,
|    at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
|  [106:8] But true to his name he saved them,
|    in order to show his might.
|  [106:9] He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
|    they marched through the depths as through desert,
|  [106:10] saved from the hand of the hostile,
|    redeemed from the hand of the foe.
|  [106:11] The waters covered their enemies:
|    not one of them was left.
|  [106:12] So then they believed in his words,
|    and began to sing his praise.

|  [106:13] But soon they forgot his deeds:
|    they did not wait for his counsel.
|  [106:14] Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
|    they put God to the test in the wilderness.
|  [106:15] He gave them the thing they had asked for,
|    but sent wasting disease among them.

|  [106:16] The camp grew jealous of Moses
|    and of Aaron, holy one of the LORD .
|  [106:17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
|    and covered Abiram’s company.
|  [106:18] Fire broke out on their company,
|    flame kindled upon the wicked.

|  [106:19] They made a calf in Horeb,
|    and bowed to the molten image.
|  [106:20] They exchanged their glorious God
|    for the image of ox that eats grass.
|  [106:21] They forgot the God who had saved them
|    by mighty deeds in Egypt
|  [106:22] Wonders in the land of Ham,
|    terrors by the Red Sea.
|  [106:23] So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
|    but for Moses his elect,
|  who stepped into the breach before him,
|    to divert his deadly wrath.

|  [106:24] They spurned the delightsome land,
|    they refused to believe in his word.
|  [106:25] They grumbled in their tents,
|    would not listen to the voice of the LORD .
|  [106:26] So he swore with uplifted hand
|    to lay them low in the wilderness;
|  [106:27] to disperse their seed among heathen,
|    to scatter them over the world.

|  [106:28] Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
|    and ate what was offered the dead.
|  [106:29] They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
|    and plague broke out among them.
|  [106:30] Then Phinehas stood between,
|    and so the plague was stayed;
|  [106:31] and it was counted to him for righteousness
|    unto all generations forever.

|  [106:32] They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
|    through them it went ill with Moses.
|  [106:33] They rebelled against his spirit,
|    and he uttered speech that was rash.

|  [106:34] They did not destroy the nations,
|  as the LORD  had commanded them;
|    [106:35] but they mingled with the heathen,
|  and learned to do as they did.
|    [106:36] Their idol gods they worshipped,
|  and they were ensnared by them.
|    [106:37] They sacrificed their sons
|  and their daughters to the demons.
|    [106:38] They poured out innocent blood
|  the blood of their sons and daughters
|    whom they offered to Canaan’s idols,
|  and the land was polluted with blood.
|    [106:39] They became unclean by their works,
|  and adulterous in their deeds.
|    [106:40] Then the LORD ’s fury was on his people,
|  filled with horror at his inheritance.
|    [106:41] He delivered them to the heathen,
|  to the sway of those who hated them.
|    [106:42] Their enemies oppressed them,
|  and subdued them under their hand.
|    [106:43] Many a time he saved them,
|  but they rebelled at his counsel,
|    and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
|  [106:44] Yet he looked upon their distress,
|    when he heard their cry.
|  [106:45] He remembered his covenant,
|    and, in his great kindness, relented.
|  [106:46] He caused them to be pitied
|    by all who carried them captive.

|  [106:47] Save us, O LORD  our God,
|    and gather us out of the nations,
|  to give thanks to your holy name,
|    and to make our boast of your praise.



|      [106:48] *Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,*
|      *from everlasting to everlasting.*
|      *And let all the people say “Amen.”*
|      *Praise the LORD .*

 [Psalms 107] 

### Book Five ###

##### Psalm 107 – The Song of the Redeemed #####

|  [107:1] Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness
|    for his kindness endures forever.
|  [107:2] Let this be the song of the ransomed,
|    whom the LORD  has redeemed from distress,
|  [107:3] gathering them from all lands,
|    east, west, north, and south.

|  [107:4] In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
|    finding no way to a city inhabited.
|  [107:5] Full of hunger and thirst,
|    their spirit failed.
|  [107:6] Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses,
|  [107:7] guiding them straight on the way,
|    till they reached an inhabited city.
|  [107:8] Let them thank the LORD  for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people;
|  [107:9] for the thirsty he satisfies,
|    and the hungry he fills with good things.

|  [107:10] Some sat in darkness and gloom
|    prisoners in irons and misery,
|  [107:11] for rebelling against God’s word,
|    and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
|  [107:12] Their heart was bowed with toil;
|    there was no one to help when they stumbled.
|  [107:13] Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|  [107:14] Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
|    and burst their chains.
|  [107:15] Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|  [107:16] For he shattered the gates of bronze,
|    and broke bars of iron.

|  [107:17] Some were sick from their wicked ways,
|    and suffering because of their sins.
|  [107:18] All manner of food they hated;
|    they had come to the gates of death.
|  [107:19] Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|  [107:20] He sent his word and healed them,
|    and delivered their life from the pit.
|  [107:21] Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|  [107:22] Let them offer to him thankofferings,
|    and with joy tell what things he has done.

|  [107:23] Some crossed the sea in ships,
|    doing business in great waters.
|  [107:24] They have seen what the LORD  can do,
|    and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
|  [107:25] At his command rose a tempest,
|    which lifted the waves on high.
|  [107:26] Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
|    their courage failed them.
|  [107:27] They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
|    all their skills useless.
|  [107:28] Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
|    and he saved them from their distresses.
|  [107:29] He stilled the storm to a whisper,
|    and the waves of the sea were hushed.
|  [107:30] They were glad, because it was quiet;
|    they were led to the haven they longed for.
|  [107:31] Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness,
|    for his wonderful deeds for people.
|  [107:32] Where the people assemble, extol him,
|    and praise him in council of elders.

|  [107:33] He turns streams into a wilderness,
|    springs of water into thirsty land,
|  [107:34] fruitful land into a salt waste,
|    because of the sin of the people.
|  [107:35] A desert he makes pools of water,
|    a land of drought into springs of water.
|  [107:36] He settles the hungry therein,
|    they establish a city to live in.
|  [107:37] They sow fields and plant vineyards,
|    which furnish a fruitful yield.
|  [107:38] By his blessing they multiply greatly,
|    and he lets not their cattle decrease.

|  [107:39] Yet when they are bowed and diminished
|    by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
|  [107:40] he pours contempt upon princes,
|    and on trackless wastes leads them astray
|  [107:41] He lifts the poor out of misery,
|    and makes families fruitful as flocks.
|  [107:42] At this sight shall the upright be glad,
|    and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
|  [107:43] Let those who are wise observe this,
|    and consider the love of the LORD

 [Psalms 108] 

##### Psalm 108 – A Prayer for Victory #####

A song. A psalm of David.

|  [108:1]  My heart is steadfast, O God,
|    my heart is steadfast.
|  I would sing, I would make music;
|    awake, my soul.
|  [108:2] Awake, harp and lyre;
|    I would wake the dawn.
|  [108:3] I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD ;
|    make music among the nations to you.
|  [108:4] For great to heaven is your love,
|    and your faithfulness to the clouds.
|  [108:5] Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens,
|    and your glory o’er all the earth.

|  [108:6] So those you love may be rescued,
|    save by your right hand and answer us.
|  [108:7] God did solemnly swear:
|    “As victor will I divide Shechem,
|  portion out the valley of Succoth.
|    [108:8] Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
|  Ephraim is my helmet,
|    Judah my sceptre of rule,
|  [108:9] Moab the pot that I wash in,
|    on Edom I hurl my sandal,
|    I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”

|  [108:10] O to be brought to the fortified city!
|    O to be led into Edom!
|  [108:11] Have you not spurned us, O God?
|    You do not march forth with our armies.

|  [108:12] Grant us help from the foe,
|    for human help is worthless.
|  [108:13] With God we shall yet do bravely,
|    he himself will tread down our foes.

 [Psalms 109] 

##### Psalm 109 – A Prayer for the Lord’s Help #####

For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

|  [109:1] O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
|    [109:2] for their wicked mouths they have opened against me,
|    they speak to me with tongues that are false,
|  [109:3] they beset me with words of hatred,
|    and fight without cause against me.
|  [109:4] My love they requite with hostility,
|    while for them I lift up my prayer.
|  [109:5] Evil for good they reward me,
|    and hatred for my love.

|  [109:6] “Set over him one who is godless,” they say,
|    “an opponent at his right hand.
|  [109:7] From his trial let him come forth guilty,
|    may his prayer be counted as sin.
|  [109:8] Grant that his days may be few,
|    that his office be seized by another.
|  [109:9] Grant that his children be fatherless,
|    and that his wife be a widow.
|  [109:10] Up and down may his children go begging,
|    expelled from their desolate home.
|  [109:11] May all that he owns be seized by the creditor
|    may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.

|  [109:12] “May none extend to him kindness,
|    or pity his fatherless children.
|  [109:13] His descendants be doomed to destruction!
|    Blotted out be his name in one generation!
|  [109:14] May his father’s guilt be remembered,
|    and his mother’s sin not blotted out:
|  [109:15] on record always before the LORD,
|    and his memory root from the earth;
|  [109:16] for he gave no thought to show kindness,
|    but pursued the poor and the needy,
|    drove the downhearted to death.

|  [109:17] “May the curses he loved light upon him,
|    may the blessings he loathed be afar.
|  [109:18] Like a garment he clothed him with curses;
|    may they pierce to his inwards like water,
|    and cling to his bones like oil.
|  [109:19] Let them be like the robe he wraps round him,
|    like the belt he wears every day.”
|  [109:20] Be this the reward of my adversaries,
|    of those who speak evil against me.

|  [109:21] But you, LORD  my GOD ,
|    be true to your name,
|      deal kindly with me;
|    in your gracious kindness
|      save me.
|  [109:22] For I am poor and needy,
|    and my heart is wounded within me.
|  [109:23] I am gone like a lengthening shadow,
|    I am shaken off like a locust.
|  [109:24] My knees totter from fasting,
|    my flesh is shrivelled and spare.
|  [109:25] They heap insults upon me:
|    when they see me, they shake their head.

|  [109:26] Help me, O LORD  my God,
|    and save me in your kindness.
|  [109:27] Teach them that this is your hand,
|    and your own doing, O LORD .
|  [109:28] Let them curse, if only you bless.
|    Put my assailants to shame,
|    and make your servant glad.
|  [109:29] My opponents be clothed with dishonor,
|    and wrapped in a robe of shame.

|  [109:30] I give thanks to you, LORD, with loud voice,
|    I give praise in the midst of the throng;
|  [109:31] for he stands by the poor, at his right hand,
|    to save them from those who condemn them.

 [Psalms 110] 

##### Psalm 110 – A Promise of Victory to the King #####

Of David, a psalm.

|  [110:1] This said the LORD  concerning my lord,
|    “Sit at my right hand,
|    till I set your foot on the neck of your foes.”

|  [110:2] On Zion the LORD  is wielding
|    your sceptre of might, and charges you
|    to rule over the foes that surround you.

|  [110:3] The day that you march to battle
|    your people will follow you gladly
|  young warriors in holy array,
|    like dew-drops, born of the morning.

|  [110:4] The LORD  has sworn and will not repent,
|    “As for you, you are priest for ever
|    as Melchizedek was.”

|  [110:5] By your side will the LORD  shatter kings
|    on the day of his wrath.
|  [110:6] He will execute judgment
|    filling the valleys with dead,
|    the broad fields with shattered heads.
|  [110:7] He will drink of the brook by the way,
|    and march onward with uplifted head.

 [Psalms 111] 

##### Psalm 111 – In Praise of the Divine Goodness #####

|      [111:1] Hallelujah.

|  I will thank the LORD  with all my heart,
|    in the assembled congregation of his people.
|  [111:2] Great are the things that the LORD  has done,
|    worthy of study by those who love them.
|  [111:3] Majestic and glorious is his work,
|    and his righteousness abides forever.
|  [111:4] For his marvelous deeds he has won renown;
|    the LORD  is gracious and full of compassion.
|  [111:5] Food he gives to those who fear him,
|    always he remembers his covenant.
|  [111:6] His mighty works he has shown to his people,
|    in giving to them the nations for heritage.
|  [111:7] All that he does is faithful and right,
|    all his behests are firm and sure.
|  [111:8] They are established for ever and ever,
|    executed with truth and uprightness.
|  [111:9] To his people he sent redemption,
|    he has appointed his covenant forever.
|  His name is holy and awe-inspiring.
|    [111:10] The fear of the LORD  is the beginning of wisdom
|  those who keep it are wise indeed.
|    His praise abides for ever and ever.

 [Psalms 112] 

##### Psalm 112 – The Blessings of Godliness #####

|      [112:1] Hallelujah.Happy are those who fear the LORD,
|    and greatly delight in his commandments.

|  [112:2] Mighty on earth shall be their seed;
|    a blessing shall rest on the race of the upright.
|  [112:3] Wealth and riches are in their houses,
|    their prosperity stands forever.
|  [112:4] To the upright arises light in the darkness;
|    full of favor and pity and kindness are they.
|  [112:5] It is well with those who show pity and lend,
|    who support all their affairs upon justice.
|  [112:6] For they will never be shaken;
|    the just will be forever remembered.
|  [112:7] They will not be afraid of evil tidings,
|    with steady heart they trust the LORD .
|  [112:8] Their heart is firm and unafraid:
|    they know they will feast their eyes on their enemies.
|    [112:9] With lavish hands they give to the poor,
|  and their prosperity stands forever.
|    They are lifted to heights of triumph and honor.
|  [112:10] The sight of them fills the wicked with anger:
|    grinding their teeth with despair.
|    The hopes of the wicked will come to nothing.

 [Psalms 113] 

##### Psalm 113 – The Lord loves the Humble #####

|  [113:3] From sunrise to sunset
|    is the name of the LORD  to be praised.

|  [113:4] High is the LORD  above all nations,
|    above the heavens is his glory.
|  [113:5] Who is like the LORD  our God,
|    seated on high?
|  [113:6] He bends down to look
|    at the heavens and earth.

|  [113:7] He raises the weak from the dust,
|    he lifts the poor from the dunghill,
|  [113:8] and sets them beside the princes,
|    even the princes of his people.
|  [113:9] He gives the childless woman a home,
|    and makes her the happy mother of children.

 [Psalms 114] 

##### Psalm 114 – The Marvel of the Exodus #####

|  [114:1] When Israel went out of Egypt,
|    Jacob’s house from a barbarous people,
|  [114:2] God chose Judah for himself,
|    Israel became his kingdom.

|  [114:3] The sea saw it, and fled,
|    Jordan river ran backwards.
|  [114:4] Mountains skipped like rams,
|    hills like the young of the flock.

|  [114:5] Why, sea, do you flee?
|    Jordan, why run backwards?
|  [114:6] Mountains, why skip ram-like?
|    Why, hills, like the young of the flock?

|  [114:7] Earth, tremble before the LORD,
|    at the presence of Jacob’s God,
|  [114:8] who turns rocks into pools of water,
|    and flint into fountains of water.

 [Psalms 115] 

##### Psalm 115 – Israel’s Incomparable God #####

|  [115:1] Not to us, LORD, not to us,
|    but to your name give glory,
|    for your kindness’ and faithfulness’ sake.
|  [115:2] Why should the heathen say,
|    “Where is now their God?”
|  [115:3] Our God he is in heaven;
|    whatever he wishes, he does.
|  [115:4] Their idols are silver and gold,
|    made by human hands.
|  [115:5] They have mouths, but cannot speak;
|    they have eyes, but cannot see.
|  [115:6] They have ears, but cannot hear;
|    they have noses, but cannot smell.
|  [115:7] They have hands, but cannot feel;
|    they have feet, but cannot walk:
|    no sound comes from their throats.
|  [115:8] Their makers become like them,
|    so do all who trust in them.

|  [115:9] O Israel, trust in the LORD :
|    he is their help and their shield.
|  [115:10] House of Aaron, trust in the LORD :
|    he is their help and their shield.
|  [115:11] You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD
|     he is their help and their shield.

|  [115:12] The LORD, mindful of us, will bless us:
|    he will bless the house of Israel,
|    he will bless the house of Aaron.
|  [115:13] He will bless those who fear the LORD,
|    the small and the great together.

|  [115:14] May the LORD  add to your numbers
|    to you and to your children.
|  [115:15] Blessed be you of the LORD,
|    creator of heaven and earth.

|  [115:16] The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
|    but the earth has he given to people.
|  [115:17] The dead cannot praise the LORD,
|    nor those who go down into silence.
|  [115:18] But we will bless the LORD
|     from now and for evermore.
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 116] 

##### Psalm 116 – Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance #####

|  [116:1] I love the LORD, for he hears
|    my voice, my pleas for mercy.
|  [116:2] For he has inclined his ear to me:
|    I will call upon him as long as I live.

|  [116:3] About me were snares of death,
|    the anguish of Sheol was upon me:
|    distress and sorrow were mine.
|  [116:4] Then I called on the name of the LORD :
|    “I beseech you, O LORD, deliver me.”

|  [116:5] Gracious and just is the LORD,
|    compassionate is our God.
|  [116:6] The LORD  preserves the simple;
|    when I was drooping, he saved me.
|  [116:7] Be at peace, my heart, once more,
|    for the LORD  has been good to you.

|  [116:8] You have rescued me from death,
|    my eyes from tears,
|    my feet from stumbling.
|  [116:9] Before the LORD  I will walk
|    in the land of the living.

|  [116:10] I held fast my faith, though I said,
|    “Ah me! I am sore afflicted,”
|  [116:11] though in my alarm I said,
|    “Everyone is a liar.”

|  [116:12] What shall I render the LORD
|     for all his bounty to me?
|  [116:13] I will lift up the cup of salvation,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|  [116:14] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people.

|  [116:15] Grave in the eyes of the LORD
|     is the death of his loyal and loved ones.
|  [116:16] Ah, LORD ! I am your servant,
|    your servant, child of your handmaid.
|    You have loosened my bonds.

|  [116:17] I will offer to you a thank-offering,
|    and call on the name of the LORD .
|  [116:18] I will pay my vows to the LORD
|     in the presence of all his people,
|  [116:19] in the courts of the house of the LORD,
|    in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 117] 

##### Psalm 117 – A Call to Praise #####

|  [117:1] Praise the LORD, all you nations:
|    laud him, all you peoples.
|  [117:2] For his mighty love is over us:
|    the LORD  is faithful forever.

 [Psalms 118] 

##### Psalm 118 – Thanksgiving for Victory #####

|  [118:1] Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness,
|    his kindness endures forever.
|  [118:2] Let the house of Israel now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.
|  [118:3] Let the house of Aaron now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.
|  [118:4] Let those who fear the LORD  now say:
|    his kindness endures forever.

|  [118:5] Out of straits I called on the LORD,
|    the LORD  answered and gave me room.
|  [118:6] The LORD  is mine; I am fearless.
|    What can mere people do to me?
|  [118:7] The LORD  is mine, as my help:
|    I shall feast my eyes on my foes.
|  [118:8] It is better to hide in the LORD
|     than to trust in mortals.
|  [118:9] It is better to hide in the LORD
|     than to put any trust in princes.
|  [118:10] Everywhere heathen swarmed round me;
|    in the name of the LORD  I cut them down.
|  [118:11] They swarmed, swarmed around me;
|    in the name of the LORD  I cut them down,
|  [118:12] they swarmed around me like bees,
|    they blazed like a fire of thorns:
|    in the name of the LORD  I cut them down.

|  [118:13] Sore they pushed me, to make me fall;
|    but the LORD  gave me his help.
|  [118:14] The LORD  is my strength and my song,
|    and he is become my salvation.
|  [118:15] Hark! In the tents of the righteous
|    glad cries of victory are ringing.
|  The hand of the LORD  has wrought bravely,
|    [118:16] the hand of the LORD  is exalted,
|    the hand of the LORD  has wrought bravely.

|  [118:17] I shall not die: nay, I shall live,
|    to declare the works of the LORD .
|  [118:18] Though the LORD  has chastened me sore,
|    he has not given me over to death.

|  *(The Procession arrives at the Temple)*

|  [118:19] “Open to me the gates of victory.
|  I would enter therein and give thanks to the LORD .”

|  *(The Welcome)*

|  [118:20] “This is the gate of the LORD :
|  the righteous may enter therein;”

|  [118:21] I thank you because you have heard me,
|    and are become my salvation.

|  [118:22] The stone which the builders despised
|    is become the head-stone of the corner.
|  [118:23] This has been wrought by the LORD ;
|    it is marvelous in our eyes.

|  [118:24] This day is the LORD ’s own creation:
|    in it let us joy and be glad.
|  [118:25] O LORD, save us, we pray,
|    O LORD, prosper, we pray.

|  [118:26] Blessed the one who enters
|    in the name of the LORD .
|  From the house of the LORD  we bless you.
|  [118:27] The LORD  is God,
|    he has given us light.
|  Wreathe the dance with boughs,
|    till they touch the horns of the altar.
|  [118:28] You are my God, I will thank you;
|    O my God, I will exalt you.
|  [118:29] Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness:
|    his kindness endures forever.

 [Psalms 119] 

##### Psalm 119 – The Power and Comfort of the Word of God #####

|  [119:1] Happy they whose life is blameless,
|    who walk by the law of the LORD .
|  [119:2] Happy they who keep his charges,
|    and seek him with all their hearts;
|  [119:3] who have done no wrong,
|    but walk in his ways.
|  [119:4] You yourself have appointed your precepts
|    to be kept with diligence.

|  [119:5] O to be steadily guided
|    in the keeping of your statutes!
|  [119:6] Then unashamed shall I be,
|    when I look towards all your commandments.
|  [119:7] I will thank you with heart unfeigned,
|    when I learn your righteous judgments.
|  [119:8] I will observe your statutes:
|    O forsake me not utterly.

|  [119:9] How can a young person keep their life pure?
|    By giving heed to your word.
|  [119:10] With all my heart have I sought you,
|    let me not stray from your commandments.
|  [119:11] In my heart have I treasured your word,
|    to keep from sinning against you.
|  [119:12] Blessed are you, O LORD ;
|    teach me your statutes.
|  [119:13] With my lips have I rehearsed
|    all the judgments of your mouth.
|  [119:14] I delight in the way of your charges,
|    more than in riches of all sorts.
|  [119:15] I will muse upon your precepts,
|    and look to your paths.
|  [119:16] In your statutes I delight,
|    I will not forget your word.

|  [119:17] Grant that your servant may live,
|    and I will observe your word.
|  [119:18] Open my eyes, that I see
|    wondrous things out of your law.
|  [119:19] But a guest am I on the earth:
|    hide not your commandments from me.
|  [119:20] My heart is crushed with longing
|    for your ordinances, at all times.
|  [119:21] You rebuke the proud, the accursed,
|    who wander from your commandments.
|  [119:22] Roll away from me scorn and contempt,
|    for I have observed your charges.
|  [119:23] Though princes sit plotting against me,
|    your servant will muse on your statutes.
|  [119:24] Your charges are my delight,
|    they are my counsellors.

|  [119:25] I lie grovelling in the dust;
|    revive me, as you have promised.
|  [119:26] I told of my ways, you made answer;
|    teach me your statutes.
|  [119:27] Grant me insight into your precepts,
|    and I will muse on your wonders.
|  [119:28] I am overcome with sorrow;
|    raise me up, as you have promised.
|  [119:29] Put the way of falsehood from me,
|    and graciously grant me your law.
|  [119:30] I have chosen the way of fidelity,
|    your ordinances I long for.
|  [119:31] I hold fast to your charges:
|    O put me not, LORD, to shame.
|  [119:32] I will run in the way of your commandments,
|    for you give me room of heart.

|  [119:33] Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes,
|    and I will keep it to the end,
|  [119:34] instruct me to keep your law,
|    and I will observe it with all my heart.
|  [119:35] Guide me in the path of your commandments,
|    for therein do I delight.
|  [119:36] Incline my heart to your charges,
|    and not to greed of gain.
|  [119:37] Turn away my eyes from vain sights,
|    revive me by your word.
|  [119:38] Confirm to your servant the promise
|    which is given to those who fear you.
|  [119:39] Remove the reproach which I dread,
|    because your judgments are good.
|  [119:40] Behold, I long for your precepts.
|    Quicken me in your righteousness.

|  [119:41] Visit me, LORD, with your love
|    and salvation, as you have promised.
|  [119:42] So shall I answer my slanderers,
|    for my trust is in your word.
|  [119:43] Snatch not from my mouth the word of truth,
|    for in your judgments I hope.
|  [119:44] I will keep your law continually,
|    for ever and evermore.
|  [119:45] So shall I walk in wide spaces,
|    for I give my mind to your precepts.
|  [119:46] I will speak of your charge before kings,
|    and will not be ashamed thereof.
|  [119:47] Your commandments are my delight,
|    I love them exceedingly.
|  [119:48] I will lift up my hands to your commandments,
|    and muse upon your statutes.

|  [119:49] Remember your word to your servant,
|    on which you have made me to hope.
|  [119:50] This is my comfort in trouble,
|    that your word gives life to me.
|  [119:51] The arrogant utterly scorn me,
|    but I have not declined from your law.
|  [119:52] When I think of your judgments of old,
|    O LORD, I take to me comfort.
|  [119:53] I am seized with glowing anger
|    at the wicked who forsake your law.
|  [119:54] Your statutes have been to me songs
|    in the house of my pilgrimage.
|  [119:55] I remember your name in the night,
|    O LORD  and observe your law.
|  [119:56] My lot has been this,
|    that I have kept your precepts.

|  [119:57] My portion are you, O LORD :
|    I have promised to keep your words.
|  [119:58] I entreat you with all my heart;
|    grant me your promised favor.
|  [119:59] I have thought upon my ways,
|    and turned my feet to your charges.
|  [119:60] I hasted and tarried not
|    to give heed to your commandments.
|  [119:61] Though the godless have wound their cords round me,
|    I have not forgotten your law.
|  [119:62] At midnight I rise to praise you
|    because of your righteous judgments.
|  [119:63] With all those who fear you I company,
|    aid with those who observe your precepts.
|  [119:64] The earth, LORD, is full of your kindness;
|    teach me your Statutes.

|  [119:65] Well have you dealt with your servant,
|    as you have promised, O LORD .
|  [119:66] Teach me discretion and knowledge,
|    for I have believed your commandments.
|  [119:67] Till trouble came I was a wanderer,
|    but now I observe your word.
|  [119:68] You are good and do good;
|    teach me your statutes.
|  [119:69] The proud have forged lies against me,
|    but I keep your precepts with all my heart.
|  [119:70] Their heart is gross like fat,
|    but I delight in your law.
|  [119:71] It was good for me to be humbled,
|    that I should learn your statutes.
|  [119:72] The law of your mouth is better to me
|    than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.

|  [119:73] Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
|    make me wise to learn your commandments.
|  [119:74] Those who fear you shall see me with joy,
|    for in your word have I hoped.
|  [119:75] I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right,
|    and in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
|  [119:76] Let your love be a comfort to me,
|    for so have you promised your servant.
|  [119:77] Visit me with your quickening pity,
|    for your law is my delight.
|  [119:78] Put the proud to shame, who have wronged me falsely:
|    I will muse on your precepts.
|  [119:79] Let those turn to me who fear you,
|    that they may learn your charges.
|  [119:80] Let my heart be sound in your statutes,
|    that I may not be put to shame.

|  [119:81] My long for you to rescue me,
|    I put my hope in your word.
|  [119:82] My eyes pine away for your promise:
|    saying, “When will you comfort me?”
|  [119:83] Though shrivelled like wine-skin in smoke,
|    your statutes I have not forgotten.
|  [119:84] How few are the days of your servant!
|    When will you judge those who harass me?
|  [119:85] Proud people have dug for me pits
|    people who do not conform to your law.
|  [119:86] All your commandments are trusty.
|    With falsehood they harass me: help me.
|  [119:87] They had nearly made an end of me,
|    yet I did not forget your precepts.
|  [119:88] Spare me in your kindness,
|    and I will observe the charge of your mouth.

|  [119:89] Forever, O LORD, is your word
|    fixed firmly in the heavens.
|  [119:90] Your truth endures age after age;
|    it is established on earth, and it stands.
|  [119:91] By your appointment they stand this day,
|    for all are your servants.
|  [119:92] Had not your law been my joy,
|    in my misery then had I perished.
|  [119:93] I will never forget your precepts,
|    for through them you have put life in me.
|  [119:94] I am yours, O save me,
|    for I give my mind to your precepts.
|  [119:95] The wicked lay wait to destroy me,
|    but I give heed to your charge.
|  [119:96] I have seen a limit to all things:
|    but your commandment is spacious exceedingly.

|  [119:97] O how I love your law!
|    All the day long I muse on it.
|  [119:98] Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies:
|    for it is mine forever.
|  [119:99] I am prudent above all my teachers,
|    for your charges are my meditation.
|  [119:100] I have insight more than the aged,
|    because I observe your precepts.
|  [119:101] I refrain my foot from all wicked ways,
|    that I may keep your word.
|  [119:102] I turn not aside from your judgments,
|    for you yourself are my teacher.
|  [119:103] How sweet are your words to my taste,
|    sweeter than honey to my mouth!
|  [119:104] Insight I win through your precepts,
|    therefore every false way I hate.

|  [119:105] Your word is a lamp to my feet,
|    and a light to my path.
|  [119:106] I have sworn an oath, and will keep it,
|    to observe your righteous judgments.
|  [119:107] I am afflicted sorely:
|    revive me, O LORD, as you said.
|  [119:108] Accept, LORD, my willing praise,
|    and teach me your judgments.
|  [119:109] My life is in ceaseless peril;
|    but I do not forget your law.
|  [119:110] The wicked set traps for me,
|    yet I do not stray from your precepts.
|  [119:111] In your charges are my everlasting inheritance,
|    they are the joy of my heart.
|  [119:112] I am resolved to perform your statutes
|    forever, to the utmost.

|  [119:113] I hate people of divided heart,
|    but your law do I love.
|  [119:114] You are my shelter and shield:
|    in your word do I hope.
|  [119:115] Begone, you wicked people,
|    I will keep the commands of my God.
|  [119:116] Uphold me and spare me, as you have promised:
|    O disappoint me not.
|  [119:117] Hold me up, and I shall be saved:
|    and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
|  [119:118] All who swerve from your statutes you spurn:
|    their cunning is in vain.
|  [119:119] All the wicked of earth you count as dross,
|    therefore I love your charges.
|  [119:120] My flesh, for fear of you, shudders,
|    and I stand in awe of your judgments.

|  [119:121] Justice and right have I practised,
|    do not leave me to my oppressors.
|  [119:122] Be your servant’s surety for good,
|    let not the proud oppress me.
|  [119:123] My eyes pine for your salvation,
|    and for your righteous promise.
|  [119:124] Deal in your love with your servant,
|    and teach me your statutes.
|  [119:125] Your servant am I; instruct me,
|    that I may know your charges.
|  [119:126] It is time for the LORD  to act:
|    they have violated your law.
|  [119:127] Therefore I love your commandments
|    above gold, above fine gold.
|  [119:128] So by all your precepts I guide me,
|    and every false way I hate.

|  [119:129] Your decrees are wonderful,
|    gladly I keep them.
|  [119:130] When your word is unfolded, light breaks;
|    it imparts to the simple wisdom.
|  [119:131] With open mouth I pant
|    with longing for your commandments.
|  [119:132] Turn to me with your favor,
|    as is just to those who love you.
|  [119:133] Steady my steps by your word,
|    so that sin have no power over me.
|  [119:134] Set me free from those who oppress me,
|    and I shall observe your precepts.
|  [119:135] Shine with your face on your servant,
|    and teach me your statutes.
|  [119:136] My eyes run down with rills of water,
|    because your law is not kept.

|  [119:137] Righteous are you, O LORD,
|    and right are your ordinances.
|  [119:138] The laws you has ordered are just,
|    and trusty exceedingly.
|  [119:139] My jealousy has undone me,
|    that my foes have forgotten your words.
|  [119:140] Your word has been tested well;
|    and your servant loves it.
|  [119:141] I am little and held in contempt,
|    but your precepts I have not forgotten.
|  [119:142] Just is your justice forever,
|    and trusty is your law.
|  [119:143] Stress and strain are upon me,
|    but your commandments are my delight.
|  [119:144] Right are your charges forever,
|    instruct me that I may live.

|  [119:145] With my whole heart I cry; O answer me.
|    I would keep your statutes, O LORD .
|  [119:146] I cry to you: O save me,
|    and I will observe your charges.
|  [119:147] Ere the dawn I cry for your help:
|    in your word do I hope.
|  [119:148] Awake I meet the night-watches,
|    to muse upon your sayings.
|  [119:149] Hear my voice in your kindness:
|    O LORD, by your judgments revive me.
|  [119:150] Near me are wicked tormentors,
|    who are far from thoughts of your law;
|  [119:151] but near, too, are you, O LORD,
|    and all your commandments are trusty.
|  [119:152] Long have I known from your charges
|    that you have founded them for all time.

|  [119:153] Look on my misery, and rescue me;
|    for I do not forget your law.
|  [119:154] Defend my cause and redeem me:
|    revive me, as you have promised.
|  [119:155] Salvation is far from the wicked,
|    for their mind is not in your statutes.
|  [119:156] Great is your pity, O LORD :
|    Revive me, as you have ordained.
|  [119:157] My foes and tormentors are many,
|    but I have not declined from your charges.
|  [119:158] I behold the traitors with loathing,
|    for they do not observe your word.
|  [119:159] Behold how I love your precepts:
|    revive me, O LORD !, in your kindness.
|  [119:160] The sum of your word is truth,
|    all your laws are just and eternal.

|  [119:161] Princes have harassed me wantonly:
|    but my heart stands in awe of your word.
|  [119:162] Over your word I rejoice
|    as one who finds great spoil.
|  [119:163] Falsehood I hate and abhor,
|    but your law do I love.
|  [119:164] Seven times a day do I praise you
|    because of your righteous judgments.
|  [119:165] Right well do they fare who love your law:
|    they go on their way without stumbling.
|  [119:166] I hope for your salvation;
|    O LORD  I do your commandments.
|  [119:167] I observe your charges:
|    I love them greatly.
|  [119:168] I observe your precepts and charges:
|    all my ways are before you.

|  [119:169] Let my cry come before you, O LORD :
|    give me insight, as you have promised.
|  [119:170] Let my prayer enter into your presence:
|    deliver me, as you have said.
|  [119:171] My lips shall be fountains of praise,
|    that you teach me your statutes.
|  [119:172] My tongue shall sing of your word,
|    for all your commandments are right.
|  [119:173] Let your hand be ready to help me,
|    for your precepts have been my choice.
|  [119:174] I long, LORD, for your salvation,
|    and your law is my delight.
|  [119:175] Revive me that I may praise you,
|    and let your precepts help me.
|  [119:176] I have strayed like a wandering sheep
|    seek your servant, because
|    I do not forget your commandments.

|    from the lip that is false
|    and the tongue that is crafty.”

|  [120:3] What shall he give to you,
|    you tongue that is crafty?
|  What yet shall he give to you?
|  [120:4] Arrows of warrior, sharpened,
|    with glowing broom coals together.

|  [120:5] Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech,

|  [120:6] Already too long have I dwelt

|  or the eyes of a maid
|    to the hand of her mistress,
|  so do our eyes turn
|    to the LORD  our God,
|  until he is gracious to us.

|  [123:3] Be gracious, be gracious to us, LORD .
|    Scorn enough, and more, have we borne
|  [123:4] More than enough have we borne
|    of derision from those at their ease,
|    of scorn from those who are haughty.

|  [124:2] “Had it not been the LORD  who was for us
|  when enemies rose against us,
|  [124:3] then alive they’d have swallowed us up,
|    when their anger was kindled against us.
|  [124:4] Then the waters would’ve swept us away,
|    and the torrent passed over us clean:
|  [124:5] then most sure would’ve passed over us clean
|    the wild seething waters.”

|  [124:6] Blest be the LORD  who has given us not
|    to be torn by their teeth.
|  [124:7] We are like a bird just escaped
|    from the snare of the fowler.

|  The snare is broken,
|    and we are escaped.
|  [124:8] Our help is the name of the LORD,
|    the Creator of heaven and earth.

A song of ascents.

|  [125:1] Those who trust in the LORD
|     are like Mount Zion,
|  that cannot be moved,
|    but abides forever.
|  [125:2] Round Jerusalem are the mountains,
|    and the LORD  is round his people
|    from now and for evermore.

|  [125:3] For he will not suffer
|    the sceptre of wrong
|  to rest on the land
|    allotted to the righteous;
|  else the righteous might put forth
|    their own hand to evil.

|  [125:4] Do good, O LORD,
|    to the good,
|    and to the true-hearted.

|  [125:5] But those who swerve
|    into crooked ways
|  will the LORD  lead away
|    with the workers of evil.

|      Peace be upon Israel.

##### Psalm 126 – Sowing in Tears #####

|  [126:1] When the LORD  turned the fortunes of Zion,

|  [126:2] Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
|    our tongue with glad shouts;
|  then among the nations they said,
|    “The LORD  has dealt greatly with them.”
|  [126:3] The LORD  had dealt greatly with us,
|    and we were rejoicing.

|  [126:4] Turn our fortunes, O LORD,
|    as the streams in the Negreb.
|  [126:5] They who sow in tears
|    shall reap with glad shouts.
|  [126:6] Forth they fare, with their burden of seed,
|    and they weep as they go.
|  But home, home, with glad shouts they shall come
|    with their arms full of sheaves.

|  [127:1] Unless the LORD  builds the house,
|    those who build it labor in vain.
|  Unless the LORD  guards the city,
|    the watchman wakes in vain.

|  [127:2] In vain you rise early,
|    and finish so late,
|    and so eat sorrow’s bread;
|  for he cares for his loved ones
|    in their sleep.

|  [127:3] Children are a gift of the LORD,
|    the fruit of the womb, a reward.
|  [127:4] Like arrows wielded by warriors,
|    are the children of youth.

|  [127:5] Happy the man who has filled
|    his quiver full of them.
|  He will not be ashamed when he speaks
|    with enemies in the gate.

|  [128:3] Like a fruitful vine shall your wife be
|    in the innermost room of your house:
|  your children, like olive shoots,
|    round about your table.

|  [128:4] See! This is the blessing
|    of the man who fears the LORD .
|  [128:5] The LORD  shall bless you from Zion.
|    You will see Jerusalem nourish
|  all the days of your life.
|    [128:6] You will see your children’s children.

|      Peace upon Israel.

|  [129:3] “The ploughers ploughed on my back,
|    they made their furrows long.
|  [129:4] But the LORD, who is righteous, has cut
|    the cords of the wicked.”

|  [129:5] Let all who are haters of Zion
|    be put to shame and defeated.
|  [129:6] May they be as the grass on the house-top,
|    which withers before it shoots up;

|  [129:7] which fills not the arms of the reaper,
|    nor the lap of the binder of sheaves
|  [129:8] whereof no one says as they pass,
|    “The blessing of God be upon you.”

|      In the name of the LORD  we bless you.

|    give heed with your ears
|    to my loud plea.

|  [130:3] If you should mark sin, LORD,
|    O LORD, who could stand?
|  [130:4] But with you is forgiveness,
|    that you may be feared.

|  [130:5] I wait for the LORD,
|    I wait for his word,
|  [130:6] I look for the LORD
|     more than watchman for morning,
|    than watchman for morning.

|  [130:7] Israel, hope in the LORD :
|    with the LORD  there is love
|  with him plenteous redemption.

|    like a young child am I.

|  [131:3] O Israel, hope in the LORD
|     from now and for evermore.

 [Psalms 132] 

##### Psalm 132 – The Ancient Promise to David and Zion #####

|  [132:1] Remember, O LORD, David
|    all his sufferings,
|  [132:2] the oath that he swore to the LORD,
|    and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob,
|  [132:3] never to enter his tent,
|    never to lie on his bed,
|  [132:4] never to give his eyes sleep
|    or his eyelids slumber,
|  [132:5] till he had found a place for the LORD,
|    for the Strong One of Jacob to live in.

|  [132:6] We heard of it in Ephrathah,
|    in the fields of Jaar we found it.
|  [132:7] We went to the place where he dwelt,
|    we bowed ourselves low at his footstool.
|  [132:8] “Arise, LORD, and enter your resting-place,
|    you and your mighty ark.
|  [132:9] Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness,
|    your faithful shout aloud for joy.
|  [132:10] For the sake of David your servant,
|    do not reject your Anointed.”

|  [132:11] The LORD  swore an oath to David
|    an oath that he will not break;
|  “I will set on your throne
|    a prince of your line.
|  [132:12] If your sons keep my covenant
|    and the statutes I teach them,
|  then their sons, too, forever,
|    will sit on your throne.”
|  [132:13] For the choice of the LORD  is Zion;
|    she is the home of his heart.

|  [132:14] “This is forever my resting-place,
|    this is the home of my heart.
|  [132:15] I will royally bless her provision,
|    and give bread to her poor in abundance.
|  [132:16] Her priests I will clothe with salvation;
|    her faithful will shout for joy.
|  [132:17] There will I raise up for David
|    a dynasty of power.
|  I have set my anointed a lamp
|    that shall never go out.
|  [132:18] Robes of shame I will put on his foes,
|    but on his head a glittering crown.”

 [Psalms 133] 

##### Psalm 133 – Family together #####

A song of ascents. Of David.

|  [133:1] Behold! How good and how pleasant
|    is the dwelling of kindred together!
|  [133:2] Like precious oil on the head
|    that ran down on the beard,
|  the beard of Aaron, running
|    over the collar of his robe:
|  [133:3] like the dew upon Hermon which falls
|    on the mountains of Zion.
|  For there has the LORD  ordained blessing –
|    life that is endless.

##### Psalm 134 – An Evening Invocation #####

|    praise the LORD .

|  [134:3] The LORD  who made heaven and earth,
|    bless you from Zion.

 [Psalms 135] 

##### Psalm 135 – The Lord’s Power Revealed in Nature and History #####

|      [135:1] Hallelujah.

|  Praise the name of the LORD .
|    Praise the LORD, you his servants,
|  [135:2] who stand in the house of the LORD,
|    in the courts of the house of our God.
|  [135:3] Praise the LORD, for the LORD  is good:
|    Sing praise to his name it is pleasant.
|  [135:4] The LORD  for himself chose Jacob,
|    Israel as his own special treasure.

|  [135:5] For I know that the LORD  is great,
|    that our LORD  is above all gods.
|  [135:6] All that he wills he does
|    in the heavens and on the earth,
|    in the seas and in all the abysses.
|  [135:7] Clouds he brings up from the ends of the earth,
|    lightnings he makes for the rain,
|    wind he brings out of his storehouses.

|  [135:8] The first-born of Egypt he struck,
|    both humans and animals.
|  [135:9] Signs and wonders he sent
|    into your midst, O Egypt,
|    upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
|  [135:10] Many nations he struck,
|    mighty kings he slew
|  [135:11] Sihon, king of the Amorites,
|    Og, king of Bashan,
|    and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
|  [135:12] He gave their land for possession,
|    possession to Israel his people.

|  [135:13] Your name, O LORD, is forever;
|    your memorial world without end.
|  [135:14] For the LORD  secures right for his people,
|    and takes pity upon his servants.

|  [135:15] The idols of heathen are silver
|    made by human hands.
|  [135:16] They have mouths, but cannot speak:
|    they have eyes, but cannot see.
|  [135:17] They have ears, but cannot hear:
|    there is no breath in their mouths.
|  [135:18] Their makers become like them,
|    so do all who trust in them.

|  [135:19] House of Israel, praise the LORD :
|    house of Araon, praise the LORD .
|  [135:20] House of Levi, praise the LORD :
|    you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD .
|  [135:21] Blest be the LORD  out of Zion,
|    who lives in Jerusalem.
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 137] 

##### Psalm 137 – By the Waters of Babylon #####

|  [137:1] By the waters of Babylon there we sat,
|    and we wept at the thought of Zion.
|  [137:2] There on the poplars we hung our harps.
|    [137:3] For there our captors called for a song:
|  our tormentors, rejoicing, saying:
|    “Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”

|  [137:4] How can we sing the LORD ’s song
|    in the foreigner’s land?
|  [137:5] If I forget you, Jerusalem,
|    may my right hand wither.
|    [137:6] May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
|  if I am unmindful of you,
|    or don’t set Jerusalem
|    above my chief joy.

|  [137:7] Remember the Edomites, LORD,
|    the day of Jerusalem’s fall,
|  when they said, “Lay her bare, lay her bare,
|    right down to her very foundation.”

|  [137:8] Babylon, despoiler,
|    happy are those who pay you back
|    for all you have done to us.
|  [137:9] Happy are they who seize and dash
|    your children against the rocks.

 [Psalms 138] 

##### Psalm 138 – The Constancy of the Lord’s Care #####

Of David.

|  [138:1] I will thank you, O LORD, with all my heart:
|    in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
|  [138:2] and prostrate before your holy temple,
|    will praise your name for your constant love,
|    for you have exulted your promise above all.

|  [138:3] When I called you, you answered;
|    you gave me strength, you inspired me.
|  [138:4] All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD,
|    when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
|  [138:5] and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
|    and tell of the LORD ’s transcendent glory.
|  [138:6] For, high though the LORD  is, he looks on the lowly,
|    and strikes down the haughty from far away.

|  [138:7] Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
|    you lay your hand on my angry foes,
|    and your right hand gives me victory.
|  [138:8] The LORD  will accomplish all that which concerns me.
|    Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever.
|    O do not abandon the work of your hands.

 [Psalms 139] 

##### Psalm 139 – The Ever-Present God #####

For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

|  [139:1] O LORD, you search and know me;
|    [139:2] when I sit, when I rise you know it,
|  you perceive my thoughts from afar.

|  [139:3] When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
|    familiar with all my ways.
|  [139:4] There is not a word on my tongue,
|    but see! LORD, you know it all.

|  [139:5] Behind and before you beset me,
|    upon me you lay your hand.
|  [139:6] It’s too wonderful for me to know
|    too lofty I cannot attain it.

|  [139:7] Whither shall I go from your spirit?
|    Or whither shall I flee from your face?
|  [139:8] If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
|    or make Sheol my bed, you are there.

|  [139:9] If I lift up the wings of the morning
|    and fly to the end of the sea,
|  [139:10] there also your hand would grasp me,
|    and your right hand take hold of me.

|  [139:11] If I say, “Let the darkness cover me,
|    and night be the light about me,”
|  [139:12] The dark is not dark for you,
|    but night is as light as the day.

|  [139:13] For you did put me together;
|    in my mother’s womb you did weave me.
|  [139:14] I give you praise for my fashioning
|    so full of awe, so wonderful.
|    Your works are wonderful.

|  You knew me right well;
|    [139:15] my bones were not hidden from you,
|  when I was made in secret,
|    and woven in the depths of the earth.

|  [139:16] Your eyes saw all my days:
|    they stood on your book every one
|  written down, before they were fashioned,
|    while none of them yet was mine.

|  [139:17] But how far, O God, beyond measure
|    are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
|  [139:18] Should I count, they are more than the sand.
|    When I wake, I am still with you.

|  [139:19] Will you slay the wicked, O God?
|    And remove from me the bloodthirsty,
|  [139:20] who maliciously defy you
|    and take your name in vain.

|  [139:21] Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD ?
|    Do I not loathe those who resist you?
|  [139:22] With perfect hatred I hate them,
|    I count them my enemies.

|  [139:23] Search me, O God, know my heart:
|    test me, and know my thoughts,
|  [139:24] and see if guile be in me;
|    and lead me in the way everlasting.

 [Psalms 140] 

##### Psalm 140 – A Prayer for Preservation #####

|  [140:1] Rescue me, LORD, from evil people;
|    from the violent guard me
|  [140:2] from those who plot evil in their heart,
|    and stir up war continually:
|  [140:3] who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent’s,
|    and under whose lips is the poison of adders. *Selah*

|  [140:4] Preserve me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked,
|    from the violent guard me
|    from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
|  [140:5] The proud have hidden a trap for me,
|    cords they have spread as a net for my feet:
|    snares they have set at the side of my track. *Selah*

|  [140:6] I have said to the LORD, “My God are you;
|    give ear, LORD, to my loud plea.
|  [140:7] O LORD  my LORD, my savior mighty,
|    you did cover my head in the day of battle.
|  [140:8] Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked;
|    and what they have purposed, promote you not.” *Selah*

|  [140:9] Let them not lift up their heads against me.
|    May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,
|  [140:10] may he rain upon them coals of fire,
|    may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
|  [140:11] no place in the land may there be for the slanderer:
|    may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.

|  [140:12] I know that the LORD  will do right by the weak,
|    and will execute justice for those who are needy.
|  [140:13] Surely the righteous shall praise your name,
|    and they who are upright shall live in your presence.

 [Psalms 141] 

##### Psalm 141 – A Prayer for Protection from Persecutors #####

A psalm of David.

|  [141:1] LORD, I call to you: hasten, to me,
|    give ear to my voice, when I call to you.
|  [141:2] Let my prayer be presented as incense before you,
|    and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.

|  [141:3] Set, O LORD, a watch on my mouth,
|    put a guard on the door of my lips.
|  [141:4] Incline not my heart to an evil matter,
|    to busy myself in deeds of wickedness,
|  in company with workers of evil:
|    never may I partake of their dainties.

|  [141:5] A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness
|    is oil which my head shall never refuse.
|    In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.

|  [141:6] Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges:
|    they shall learn that my words are true.

|  [141:7] Like stones on a country road cleft and broken
|    so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
|  [141:8] But my eyes are turned towards you, O LORD .
|    Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
|  [141:9] Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me,
|    from the snares of the workers of trouble.
|  [141:10] Into their own nets let wicked people fall;
|    while I pass by in safety.

 [Psalms 142] 

##### Psalm 142 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Persecutors #####

A maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer.

|  [142:1] Loudly I cry to the LORD :
|    to the LORD  plead loudly for mercy,
|  [142:2] I pour my complaint before him,
|    I tell my troubles to him.

|  [142:3] When my spirit is faint within me,
|    my path is known to you.
|  In the way I am wont to walk in,
|    they have hidden a trap for me.

|  [142:4] I look to the right and the left;
|    but not a friend have I.
|  No place of refuge is left me,
|    not a man to care for me.

|  [142:5] So I cry to you, O LORD :
|    I say, “My refuge are you,
|    all I have in the land of the living.”

|  [142:6] Attend to my piercing cry,
|    for very weak am I.
|  Save me from those who pursue me,
|    for they are too strong for me.

|  [142:7] Free me from prison,
|    that I may give thanks to your name,
|  for the righteous are patiently waiting
|    till you show your bounty to me.

 [Psalms 143] 

##### Psalm 143 – A Prayer for Deliverance and Guidance #####

|  [143:1] Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
|    give ear to my plea.
|  In your faithfulness give me answer,
|    and in your righteousness.
|  [143:2] With your servant O enter you not into judgment,
|    for in your sight can no one alive be justified.

|  [143:3] For the enemy persecutes me,
|    crushing my life to the ground,
|  making me live in the darkness,
|    as those who have long been dead.
|  [143:4] My spirit is faint within me,
|    my heart is bewildered within me.

|  [143:5] I remember the days of old,
|    and brood over all you have done,
|  musing on all that your hands have wrought.
|    [143:6] I spread out my hands to you:
|  I thirst for you,
|    like parched earth. *Selah*

|  [143:7] Answer me soon, LORD,
|    because my spirit is spent.
|  Hide not your face from me,
|    else become I like those who go down to the pit.
|  [143:8] Let me learn of your love in the morning,
|    for my trust is in you.
|  Teach me the way I should go:
|    for my heart longs for you.

|  [143:9] Save me, O LORD, from my foes:
|    for to you I have fled for refuge.
|  [143:10] Teach me to do your will,
|    for you yourself are my God.
|  Guide me by your good spirit,
|    O LORD, on a way that is smooth.

|  [143:11] Be true to your name LORD, spare me,
|    bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
|  [143:12] In your kindness extinguish my enemies,
|    and all those who vex me destroy;
|    for I am your servant.

 [Psalms 144] 

##### Psalm 144 – The Warrior’s Song #####

Of David.

|  [144:1] Blest be the LORD  my rock,
|    who trains my hands for war,
|    my fingers for fighting.
|  [144:2] My rock and my fortress,
|    my tower, my deliverer,
|  my shield, behind whom I take refuge,
|    who lays nations low at my feet.

|  [144:3] LORD, what are mortals
|    that you care for them,
|  humans,
|    that you think of them?
|  [144:4] They are like a breath,
|    their days as a shadow that passes.

|  [144:5] LORD, bow your heavens and come down:
|    touch the hills, so that they smoke.
|  [144:6] Flash forth lightning and scatter them,
|    your arrows send forth and confound them.

|  [144:7] Stretch out your hand from on high;
|    pluck me out of the mighty waters,
|    out of the hands of foreigners,
|  [144:8] who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
|    and lift their right hand to swear lies.

|  [144:9] O God, a new song I would sing you,
|    on a ten-stringed harp make you music.
|  [144:10] For to kings you give the victory,
|    and David your servant you save.
|  [144:11] Snatch me from the cruel sword,
|    rescue me from the hand of foreigners,
|  who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
|    and lift their right hand to swear lies.

##### The Prosperity of the Lord’s People #####

|  [144:12] May our sons in their youth
|    be as plants well tended:
|  our daughters like cornices
|    carved as in palaces.

|  [144:13] May our barns be bursting
|    with produce of all kinds.
|  In the fields may our sheep bear
|    by thousands and ten thousands.

|  [144:14] May our cattle be fat,
|    our walls unbreached,
|  may no cry of distress
|    ring in our streets.

|  [144:15] Happy the people
|    who fares so well:
|  and so fares the people
|    whose God is the LORD .

|    his greatness is unsearchable.
|  [145:4] One age to another shall praise your deeds,
|    declaring the mighty things you have done.

|  [145:5] Of your glorious majesty they shall tell,
|    and I will muse of your many wonders.
|  [145:6] Of the might of your terrible acts they shall speak,
|    and the tale of your great deeds I will tell.

|  [145:7] The fame of your abundant goodness
|    and righteousness they shall pour forth in song.
|  [145:8] The LORD  is full of grace and pity,

|  [145:9] The LORD  is good to all the world,
|    and his pity is over all things that he made.
|  [145:10] All your works give you thanks, O LORD,
|    and you are blessed of those who love you.

|  [145:11] They shall speak of your glorious kingdom,
|    and of your might shall they discourse,
|  [145:12] making known to all his mighty acts,
|    and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.

|  [145:13] Yours is a kingdom that lives through all ages:
|    through all generations extends your dominion.
|  The LORD  is faithful in all that he promises,
|    gracious is he in all that he does.

|    he will hear their cry for help and save them.

|  [145:20] The LORD  is the keeper of all who love him,
|    but all the wicked will he destroy.
|  [145:21] My mouth will utter the praise of the LORD,
|    and all life will bless his holy name
|      for ever and ever.

 [Psalms 146] 

##### Psalm 146 – The Great Protector #####

|  [146:1] My soul, praise the LORD .
|    [146:2] I will praise the LORD, while I live;
|  I will sing to my God, while I am.

|  [146:3] Put not your trust in princes
|    mortals, in whom is no help.
|  [146:4] When their breath goes out,
|    they go back to the dust:
|  on that very day
|    their purposes perish.
|    [146:5] Happy those whose help
|    is the God of Jacob:
|  whose hope is set
|    on the LORD  their God,
|  [146:6] the Creator of heaven and earth,
|    the sea, and all that is in them.

|  He remains eternally loyal.
|    [146:7] For the wronged he executes justice;
|  he gives bread to the hungry;
|    the LORD  releases the prisoners.
|  [146:8] The LORD  gives sight to the blind:
|    the LORD  raises those who are bowed.
|  The LORD  loves the righteous.
|    [146:9] The LORD  preserves the stranger,
|  upholds the widow and orphan,
|    but the wicked he leads to disaster.

|  [146:10] The LORD  shall reign forever,
|    your God, O Zion, to all generations.
|      Hallelujah.

 [Psalms 147] 

##### Psalm 147 – The Lord’s Love and Power Revealed in Nature #####

|      [147:1] Hallelujah.

|  It is good to sing praise to our God,
|    for praise is sweet and seemly.
|  [147:2] The LORD  builds up Jerusalem,
|    the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
|  [147:3] He heals the broken in heart,
|    and binds up their wounds.
|  [147:4] He counts the numberless stars,
|    he gives names to them all.
|  [147:5] Great is our LORD, rich in power,
|    and measureless is his wisdom.
|  [147:6] The LORD  lifts up the down-trodden,
|    the wicked he brings to the ground.

|  [147:7] Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
|    and play on the lyre to our God.
|  [147:8] For he covers the sky with clouds,
|    he prepares rain for the earth,
|    makes grass to grow on the mountains.
|  [147:9] He gives the cattle their food
|    the young ravens when they cry.
|  [147:10] His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
|    his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
|  [147:11] but the LORD  has his pleasure in those who fear him,
|    in those who wait for his kindness.

|  [147:12] Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
|    sing praise to your God, O Zion.
|  [147:13] For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
|    and blesses your children within you.
|  [147:14] He brings peace to your borders,
|    and choicest of wheat in abundance.
|  [147:15] He sends his command to the earth:
|    his word runs very swiftly.
|  [147:16] Snow he gives like wool,
|    frost he scatters like ashes.
|  [147:17] He casts forth his ice like morsels:
|    who can stand before his cold?
|  [147:18] He sends forth his word, and melts them:
|    his wind blows the waters flow.

|  [147:19] He declares his word to Jacob,
|    his statutes and judgments to Israel.
|  [147:20] No other nation did he do this for,
|    they know nothing of his judgments.
|      Hallelujah.

PROVERBS
========

 [Proverbs 1] 

##### On the Worth of Wisdom #####

|  [1:1] The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.

##### The Aim of the Book #####

|  [1:2] That people may learn wisdom and discipline,
|    and understand words of discernment;
|  [1:3] that they may win training in prudence,
|    in right and in justice and rectitude;
|  [1:4] that shrewdness be imparted to the simple,
|    and knowledge and insight to youth –
|  [1:5] the wise too, who listens, will grow wiser,
|    and the prudent more skilled in direction –
|  [1:6] that proverbs and parables may be plain,
|    even the words of the wise and their riddles

##### The Motto of the Book #####

|  [1:7] Reverence for the Lord is the basis of knowledge,
|    but wisdom and discipline are scorned by fools.

##### Exhortation and Warning #####

|  [1:8] Listen, my child, to your father’s instruction,
|    and do not forsake what you mother has taught you;
|  [1:9] they will be a garland to your head,
|    and a chain for your neck.

|  [1:10] My son, if sinners entice you,
|    do not consent.[1:11] If they say,
|  “Come with us, let us lurk for the blameless,
|    and ambush the innocent for fun –
|  [1:12] let us swallow them up like the grave, alive
|    and entire, just as those that go down to the pit.
|  [1:13] Precious wealth of all sorts will be ours,
|    we will fill our houses with spoil.
|  [1:14] Cast your lot with us;
|    we will all share what we steal,”
|  [1:15] Do not go their way, my child.
|    Keep your foot away from their path.
|  [1:16] For their feet hasten to evil,
|    and they rush to shed blood.
|  [1:17] The net is spread in the sight of the birds,
|    who hungrily take the bait.
|  [1:18] Their own is the blood they lurk for.
|    Their own are the lives they ambush.
|  [1:19] So end all who would grasp at gain –
|    it destroys the life of its owner.

##### The Appeal of Wisdom #####

|  [1:20] Wisdom cries aloud in the streets,
|    in the squares echoes her voice,
|  [1:21] she calls from the top of the walls,
|    at the doors of the city gates she says:
|  [1:22] “How long will you fools love folly,
|    and scoffers delight in scoffing,
|    and fools in their hatred of knowledge?
|  [1:23] Respond to my rebuke.
|    See! I speak my mind to you;
|    I will tell you my thoughts.
|  [1:24] Because you refused my call,
|    gave no heed to my hand when it beckoned you,
|  [1:25] rejected all my counsel,
|    and refused my admonition,
|  [1:26] when distress falls on you, I will laugh;
|    I will mock, when your terror comes,
|  [1:27] when your terror comes as a storm,
|    as a whirlwind your distress.
|  [1:28] Then I will not answer their call;
|    they may seek, but they will not find me.
|  [1:29] Because they hated knowledge,
|    and rejected the fear of the Lord,
|  [1:30] would have nothing of my counsel.
|    but despised all my admonition,
|  [1:31] they must eat the fruit of their ways,
|    and be filled with their own devices.
|  [1:32] By their own choice will the simple be slain.
|    Prosperous ease will bring fools to destruction.
|  [1:33] But he who listens to me will live securely,
|    in a peace unruffled by fear of calamity.”        

 [Proverbs 2] 

##### The Blessed Fruits of Wisdom #####

|  [2:1] My child, if you welcome my words,
|    and hold close my commandments,
|  [2:2] giving heedful ear to wisdom,
|    and bending your mind to reason;
|  [2:3] if you seek to invoke understanding.
|    and lift up your voice to reason,
|  [2:4] seeking for her as if for silver,
|    and searching for her as if for treasure:
|  [2:5] then the fear of the Lord will be plain to you,
|    and the knowledge of God you will find.
|  [2:6] For the Lord is the giver of wisdom.
|    The source of knowledge and insight.
|  [2:7] He stores up ability for the upright;
|    he shields the blameless life.
|  [2:8] He guards the paths of the just,
|    and he watches the way of the faithful.
|  [2:9] Then justice and right will be plain to you;
|    you will keep to all paths that are good.

|  [2:10] When wisdom will enter your mind,
|    and in knowledge you find your pleasure,
|  [2:11] discretion will watch over you,
|    and understanding will guard you,
|  [2:12] and save you from wicked ways,
|    from people of perverse speech,
|  [2:13] who leave the paths of right,
|    to walk in ways of darkness –
|  [2:14] happy in doing wrong,
|    exulting in wicked perverseness,
|  [2:15] all crooked in their paths.
|    and devious in their ways.

|  [2:16] From the adultress too, it will save you,
|    the sinning woman of slippery speech,
|  [2:17] who forsakes the partner of her youth,
|    and forgets her bond with her God;
|  [2:18] for her house sinks down to death,
|    and her paths lead to the place of the dead.
|  [2:19] None that visit her ever come back,
|    or arrive at the paths of life.
|  [2:20] Therefore walk in the way of good people.
|    Keep in the paths of the righteous,
|  [2:21] for the upright will live in the land,
|    and the blameless alone will enjoy it;
|  [2:22] while bad people are cut off from it.
|    and the faithless uprooted.

 [Proverbs 3] 

##### The Wisdom of Trusting and Honouring the Lord #####

|  [3:1] My son, do not forget my teaching,
|    keep my commandments in mind;
|  [3:2] for a long and happy life
|    and fulness of peace will they bring you.
|  [3:3] Let not kindness and faithfulness leave you.
|    Bind them about your neck;
|  [3:4] so favour and good repute will you find
|    alike with God and people.
|  [3:5] Trust the Lord with all your heart.
|    Lean not on your own understanding:
|  [3:6] in all your ways acknowledge him,
|    and he will smooth your paths.
|  [3:7] Do not pride yourself on your wisdom;
|    fear the Lord and turn from evil.
|  [3:8] Then there will be health to your body,
|    and refreshment to your bones.
|  [3:9] If you honour the Lord with your wealth,
|    with the first-fruits of all that comes in to you,
|  [3:10] your barns will be filled with corn,
|    and with wine will your vats overflow.        

##### The Worth of Wisdom #####

|  [3:11] Reject not, my son, the Lord’s chastening.
|    Do not spurn His reproof.
|  [3:12] For whom the Lord loves, he chastens,
|    he reproves the child he delights in.
|  [3:13] Happy those who find wisdom,
|    they who obtain understanding.
|  [3:14] For she brings a gain fairer than silver,
|    a revenue better than gold.
|  [3:15] More precious is she than corals,
|    and with her can no treasures compare.
|  [3:16] In her right hand is long life,
|    in her left are riches and honour.
|  [3:17] Her ways are pleasant ways,
|    and all her paths are peace.
|  [3:18] She is a tree of life to those who grasp her.
|    Happy they who hold her fast.

|  [3:19] The Lord by wisdom founded the earth,
|    by understanding established the heavens.
|  [3:20] By knowledge he broke up the deeps.
|    and the clouds he made drip with dew.*************

##### The Security that comes from Wisdom #####

|  [3:21] Observe, my child, discretion and wisdom,
|    let them never out of your sight;
|  [3:22] so will they be life to you.
|    An ornament round your neck.
|  [3:23] You will then go your way securely.
|    Without ever striking your foot.
|  [3:24] You will sit down unafraid,
|    and your sleep will be sweet where you lie.
|  [3:25] You will fear no sudden terror,
|    nor the tempest that falls on the wicked.
|  [3:26] For the Lord is the ground of your hope.
|    He will keep your foot from the snare.

|  [3:27] Withhold from your neighbour no good
|    Which you have in your power to do them.
|  [3:28] Do not tell them – when you can afford it – to go
|    and come back, with the promise of something tomorrow.
|  [3:29] Devise no mischief against your neighbour,
|    while they are trustfully living beside you.
|  [3:30] Do not idly quarrel with anyone
|    who has not done you any harm.

|  [3:31] Do not envy the violent,
|    or choose any one of their ways.
|  [3:32] For the Lord abhors the crooked,
|    but the upright are his friends.
|  [3:33] The Lord’s curse rests on the house of the wicked.
|    But the home of the righteous he blesses.
|  [3:34] As for him, he scoffs at scoffers,
|    but he gives grace to the lowly.
|  [3:35] Wise men come to honour,
|    but shame is the portion of fools.

 [Proverbs 4] 

##### The Excellence and Beneficent Power of Wisdom #####

|  [4:1] Listen, children, to a father’s instruction.
|    Pay attention to gain understanding.
|  [4:2] For the counsel I give you is good.
|    Do not forsake my teaching.

|  [4:3] When I was my father’s child,
|    loved by my mother, and tender,
|  [4:4] he used to say, as he taught me,
|    “Hold fast my words in your mind.
|    Keep my commandments and live.
|  [4:5] Get wisdom, get understanding.
|  [4:6] If you do not leave her, she will keep you;
|    If you hold her dear, she will guard you.
|  [4:8] Prize her and she will exalt you
|    and honour you if you embrace her.
|  [4:9] She will set a fair wreath on your head
|    and a glorious crown she will give you.”

|  [4:10] Listen, my son, and accept my words,
|    and the years of your life will be many.
|  [4:11] I teach you the way of wisdom,
|    I guide you in honour’s paths.
|  [4:12] You will walk with steps unconstrained.
|    You will run without ever stumbling.
|  [4:13] Keep unceasing hold of instruction;
|    Guard her, for she is your life.
|  [4:14] Do not enter the path of the wicked.
|    Do now walk in the way of the evil.
|  [4:15] Do not cross it, avoid it.
|    Turn aside, and pass on.
|  [4:16] For they do not sleep unless they have done some harm.
|    They are sleepless until they have wrought some ruin.
|  [4:17] For the bread that they eat is won by crime,
|    and the wine that they drink is procured by cruelty.
|  [4:19] The way of the wicked is through deep darkness,
|    Which hides from them that they stumble into;
|  [4:18] but the way of the just is like light of the morning,
|    which shines more and more till the day is full.

|  [4:20] My son, listen to my words.
|    Bend your ear to the things that I say.
|  [4:21] Do not let them out of your sight.
|    Keep them within your heart.
|  [4:22] They are life to those who find them,
|    and health to all their being.
|  [4:23] Guard your heart with all vigilance,
|    for this is the way to life.
|  [4:24] Put away all crooked speech,
|    and banish all devious talk.
|  [4:25] Let your eyes look straight in front,
|    and your eyelids right before you.
|  [4:26] Make a level path for your feet,
|    and let all your ways be firm.
|  [4:27] Do not turn to the right or the left.
|    Keep your foot away from evil.

 [Proverbs 5] 

##### The Wrong and Folly of Impurity #####

###### The Deadly Power of an Evil Woman ######

|  [5:1] My son, listen to wisdom,
|    bend your ear to understanding;
|  [5:2] so that discretion may watch over you,
|    and that knowledge may preserve you.
|  [5:3] For the lips of the harlot drop honey,
|    her mouth is smoother than oil;
|  [5:4] but at last she is bitter as wormwood,
|    and sharp as a two-edged sword.
|  [5:5] Her feet go down to Death;
|    her steps lead straight into Sheol.
|  [5:6] No smooth way of life does she walk;
|    her paths wander – she doesn’t know where.
|  [5:7] And now, my son, listen to me;
|    Do not turn from the words that I speak.
|  [5:8] Move far away from her.
|    Do not go near the door of her house;
|  [5:9] or you might give your wealth to others,
|    your years to the implacable,
|  [5:10] and so strangers enjoy your substance,
|    and a family of foreigners your toil;
|  [5:11] and thus at the last you groan,
|    when body and flesh are consumed:
|  [5:12] “Why did I hate instruction,
|    and spurn reproof in my heart?
|  [5:13] Why did I not listen to my teachers,
|    nor bent to instructors mine ear?
|  [5:14] All but utterly was I undone
|    in the congregation assembled.”

###### Exhortation to Fidelity ######

|  [5:15] Drink water from your own cistern,
|    running water from your own well.
|  [5:16] Do not let your springs be scattered abroad,
|    on the streets your streams of water.
|  [5:17] Let them be for yourself alone,
|    and not for strangers beside you.
|  [5:18] Let your fountain be your own,
|    take joy from the wife of your youth –
|  [5:19] lovely hind and graceful doe –
|    let her breasts make you happy at all times.
|    be ravished with her love forever.
|  [5:20] For why be ravished by a stranger,
|    and a foreigners’s bosom embrace?
|  [5:21] For the ways of a man are before the Lord’s eyes,
|    and all his paths he weighs.
|  [5:22] His iniquities will snare him,
|    enmeshed in the toils of his sin.
|  [5:23] He will die for lack of instruction
|    and perish for his vast folly.

 [Proverbs 6] 

###### Warning against the Adulteress ######

|  [6:20] Observe, my child, the commands of your father,
|    do not abandon your mother’s instruction.
|  [6:21] Bind them onto your heart forever;
|    hang them round about your neck.
|  [6:22] When you walk, Wisdom will guide you;
|    when you lie down, she will watch you;
|    when you wake up, she will talk with you.
|  [6:23] For precept illumines, instruction enlightens,
|    and reproof that disciplines leads to life,
|  [6:24] Preserving you safe from the wife of another,
|    from the slippery tongue of the stranger.

|  [6:25] Do not long in your heart for her beauty.
|    Do not be caught by her eyes.
|  [6:26] For, while harlotry costs but a morsel of bread,
|    ’Tis the precious life the adulteress hunts.
|  [6:27] Can a man take fire in his bosom
|    without his clothes being burned?
|  [6:28] Or on glowing coals can he walk
|    without his feet being scorched?
|  [6:29] So with him that approaches his neighbour’s wife:
|    no one that touches her ever may go unpunished.
|  [6:30] Do people not despise a thief,
|    When he steals even to satisfy hunger?
|  [6:31] When caught, he must pay seven-fold.
|    And give all that his house contains.
|  [6:32] But the adulterer is witless:
|    he destroyes himself by his doings.
|  [6:33] For stripes and disgrace will be his,
|    And a shame that will never be blotted.
|  [6:34] For jealousy maddens a man;
|    in the day of revenge he is pitiless.
|  [6:35] He will accept no ransom,
|    nor will gifts in profusion content him.

 [Proverbs 7] 

###### Another Warning ######

|  [7:1] My son, observe my words,
|    And lay up with you my commandments.
|  [7:2] Keep my commandments and live,
|    and my teaching as the pupil of your eye.
|  [7:3] Bind them upon your fingers;
|    write them on the tablet of your heart.
|  [7:4] Say to Wisdom, “You are my sister”;
|    call Understanding your friend –
|  [7:5] shun the dissolute woman,
|    the stranger of slippery speech.

|  [7:6] At the window of her house
|    she peers out through the lattice;
|  [7:7] and, looking at the simpletons,
|    she detects a silly youth,
|  [7:8] as he passes near the street corner.
|    Stepping the way to her house,
|  [7:9] just in the evening twilight,
|    As the night is growing dark.
|  [7:10] See! The woman comes out to meet him,
|    in a harlot’s dress, all a-flutter.
|  [7:11] Boisterous and brazen is she:
|    her feet are restless at home.
|  [7:12] Now in street, now in square is she.
|    Lurking near every corner.
|  [7:13] So she catches and kisses him,
|    and with impudent face she accosts him:
|  [7:14] “I have ready a thanksgiving feast,
|    for today I have paid my vows;
|  [7:15] and so I came out to meet you,
|    to seek you, and now I have found you, so
|  [7:16] I have spread my couch with coverlets,
|    striped with Egyptian yarn.
|  [7:17] I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
|    with cinnamon and with aloes.
|  [7:18] Come; let us drink love till the morning,
|    and yield us to merry caresses.
|  [7:19] For my husband is not at home;
|    he is far away on a journey.
|  [7:20] He has taken a money-bag with him,
|    he will not come home till full moon.”
|  [7:21] With her fair speech she beguiled him,
|    with her blandishing words she enticed him.
|  [7:22] So he followed her bewitched,
|    like an ox that is brought to the slaughter,
|  like a dog that is led on a chain,
|    [7:23] like a bird rushing into a net,
|  unaware that its life is at stake,
|    till an arrow pierces its liver.

|  [7:24] And now, my son, listen to me.
|    Give heed to the words that I utter.
|  [7:25] Let your heart not swerve to her ways,
|    and wander not in her paths;
|  [7:26] for the dead she has cast down are many,
|    and many are those she has slain.
|  [7:27] Her house is the road to Sheol,
|    straight down to the chambers of Death.

 [Proverbs 8] 

##### The Invitation and the Rewards of Wisdom #####

###### Wisdom’s Appeal to Men ######

|  [8:1] Listen! Wisdom is calling,
|    and Reason is lifting her voice:
|  [8:2] on a raised place, high by the way.
|    on the streets she has taken her stand.
|  [8:3] By the gates that lead into the city.
|    She cries aloud at the portals:
|  [8:4] “to you, O men, I call.
|    And my voice is to all mankind.
|  [8:5] You simple ones, learn to be prudent;
|    You foolish ones, get to know wisdom.
|  [8:6] O listen, for grave is my message.
|    And right all the speech of my lips.
|  [8:7] It is truth that my mouth discourses,
|    And falsehood my lips abhor.
|  [8:8] All the words that I utter are honest.
|    Free from all that is crooked and tortuous,
|  [8:9] All clear to the man of sense,
|    and right to those that have knowledge.
|  [8:10] Choose instruction, then, rather than silver,
|    and more than choice gold welcome knowledge.
|  [8:11] For better is Wisdom than corals;
|    no treasures with her can compare.
|  [8:12] I, Wisdom, possess intelligence;
|    knowledge and insight are mine.
|  [8:14] Mine are counsel and skill;
|    understanding and might are mine.
|  [8:15] By me do monarchs reign
|    and rulers administer justice,
|  [8:16] By me do princes govern
|    and noblemen rule the earth.
|  [8:17] Those that love me I love,
|    and those that seek me find me.
|  [8:18] With me are riches and honour,
|    prosperity and grandeur.
|  [8:19] My fruit is better than finest gold,
|    my revenue fairer than choicest silver.
|  [8:20] I walk in the way that is fair,
|    and keep to the paths of justice,
|  [8:21] endowing with wealth those that love me,
|    and filling their treasuries full.

###### Wisdom’s Ancient Origin ######

|  [8:22] At the very beginning God fashioned me
|    as the first of His works of old.
|  [8:23] In the ancient time was I formed,
|    at the first, when the world began.
|  [8:24] I was born when as yet no depths were,
|    no fountains laden with water;
|  [8:25] Ere yet the mountains were sunk,
|    and before the hills was I born;
|  [8:26] Ere the earth and the fields were created,
|    or the first of the clods of the world.
|  [8:27] When He set up the heavens, I was there;
|    when He vaulted the face of the deep;
|  [8:28] When He made firm the skies above,
|    and fixed the deep fast at its sources;
|  [8:29] When He set to the sea its bounds,
|    as He marked off the base of the world.
|  [8:30] Then beside Him was I as His nursling,
|    and I was His daily delight,
|    playing before Him at all times,
|  [8:31] playing about in His world.
|    delighting in humankind.

###### Wisdom’s Concluding Appeal ######

|  [8:32] And now, children, listen to me:
|    happy those that keep to my ways.
|  [8:33] Hear instruction, and thus get wisdom.
|    Do not reject my admonition.
|  [8:34] Happy he who listens to me,
|    daily watching at my gates,
|    and waiting at my door-posts.
|  [8:35] For who finds me finds life,
|    he wins the Lord’s own favour;
|  [8:36] but who misses me wrongs himself,
|    for all that hate me love death.

 [Proverbs 9] 

##### The Two Hostesses – Wisdom and Folly #####

###### The Invitation of Wisdom ######

|  [9:1] Wisdom has built her a house,
|    has set up her seven pillars,
|  [9:2] slain her beasts, and mingled her wine,
|    and also spread her table.
|  [9:3] She has sent forth her maidens to cry
|    on the thoroughfares of the city:
|  [9:4] “All simple ones, turn in hither,
|    I would speak to him who lacks wisdom.
|  [9:5] Come and eat of my bread.
|    and drink of the wine I have mingled,
|  [9:6] Abandon your folly, and live,
|    and walk in the way of reason.
|  [9:11] For by me your days will be many,
|    and the years of your life increased.”

###### The Invitation of Folly ######

|  [9:13] Dame Folly is loud and seductive,
|    she is a stranger to shame.
|  [9:14] At the door of her house she sits,
|    on the thoroughfares of the city,
|  [9:15] calling to passers-by,
|    who are going straight on their way:
|  [9:16] “All simple ones, turn in hither,
|    I would speak to him who lacks wisdom.
|  [9:17] Stolen waters are sweet,
|    and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”
|  [9:18] But he does not know that dead men are there,
|    that her guests lie sunken in Sheol.

###### A Group of Aphorisms ######

|  [9:7] Who corrects a scoffer but gets himself insult,
|    and a stain rests on him that reproves the wicked.
|  [9:8] Reprove not a scoffer, or else he may hate you;
|    but a wise man reprove, and for that he will love you.
|  [9:9] Give to a wise man, and he will grow wiser;
|    instruct the righteous, and more he will learn.
|  [9:10] The fear of the Lord is the first step to wisdom,
|    and to know the Holy One is understanding.
|  [9:12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
|    And if you scoff, you must bear it alone.

 [Proverbs 6] 

##### Warnings #####

###### Against Suretyship ######

|  [6:1] My son if you have gone bail for your neighbour,
|    and given your pledge for another;
|  [6:2] if by your own lips you are snared,
|    and are trapped by the words of your mouth:
|  [6:3] then this do, my son, and free yourself,
|    since you have come into his power.
|  Go, stir youself, besiege your neighbour;
|  [6:4] give no sleep to your eyes.
|    nor slumber to your eyelids,
|  [6:5] shake yourself free, like a roe, from the snare,
|    or a bird from the hand of the fowler.

###### Against Indolence ######

|  [6:6] Go to the ant, you sluggard;
|    consider her ways, and be wise,
|  [6:7] without officer, ruler, or chief,
|  [6:8] she provides her bread in the summer.
|    and gathers her food in the harvest.

|  [6:9] How long will you lie, O sluggard?
|    When will you rise from your sleep?
|  [6:10] “Just a little more sleep, a little more slumber,
|    a little more lying with folded hands.”
|  [6:11] So will poverty come on you like a robber,
|    and want like an armed man.

###### Against Underhand Mischief-making ######

|  [6:12] Sunk in wickedness is the man
|    whose speech is ingrained with falsehood –
|  [6:13] who winks his eyes,
|    or shuffles his feet,
|    or makes signs with his fingers,
|  [6:14] gives his mind to the planning of mischief,
|    and always is scattering discord.
|  [6:15] For these things will sudden disaster assail him;
|    he will swiftly be crushed beyond all hope of healing.

###### Seven Detestable Things ######

|  [6:16] Six things there are which the Lord detests,
|    yes, seven does He abhor:
|  [6:17] haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
|    and hands that shed innocent blood,
|  [6:18] a mind that plans wicked devices,
|    and feet that are swift to do wrong,
|  [6:19] a false witness that utters lies,
|    One that scatters strife among brethren.

 [Proverbs 10] 

##### First Collection of Proverbs #####

[10:1] The Proverbs of Solomon:

|  A wise son makes his father glad,
|    but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
|  [10:2] Treasures wrongly acquired profit nothing,
|    but righteousness saves from death.
|  [10:3] The Lord will not suffer the righteous to hunger,
|    but He will frustrate the desire of the wicked.
|  [10:4] A slack hand creates poverty,
|    but a diligent hand makes rich.
|  [10:5] He that gathers in summer acts wisely;
|    he that sleeps in harvest acts shamefully.
|  [10:6] The blessing of God is on the head of the righteous,
|    but sorrow will cover the face of the wicked.
|  [10:7] The memory of the righteous is blessed,
|    but the name of the wicked will rot.
|  [10:8] A wise man gives heed to commands,
|    but a foolish talker will fall.
|  [10:9] He whose life is blameless walks safely,
|    but he who lives crookedly smarts for it.
|  [10:10] He who winks the eye makes trouble,
|    but frank reproof makes peace.
|  [10:11] A fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous,
|    but the mouth of the wicked is wrapped in violence.
|  [10:12] Hatred stirs up strife,
|    but love hides all transgressions.
|  [10:13] On the lips of a prudent man wisdom is found,
|    but a man without sense needs a rod for his back.
|  [10:14] Wise men keep what they know to themselves,
|    but the mouth of the fool is impending destruction.
|  [10:15] The rich man’s wealth is his fortified city;
|    but the poor, by their poverty, come to destruction.
|  [10:16] The wage of the righteous conduces to life,
|    but their revenue brings the wicked to ruin.
|  [10:17] The way to life is to heed instruction,
|    but to turn from reproof is to go astray.
|  [10:18] Righteous lips cover up hatred,
|    but the slanderer is a fool.
|  [10:19] Where words are many, offences are certain;
|    But he who controls his tongue does wisely.
|  [10:20] The tongue of the just is like choicest silver,
|    but the mind of the wicked is little worth.
|  [10:21] The speech of the righteous is sustenance to many,
|    but lack of sense is the death of fools.
|  [10:22] It is only the blessing of God that brings wealth,
|    and He adds no sorrow therewith.
|  [10:23] To a fool the doing of wrong is as sport,
|    but a man of sense abhors it.
|  [10:24] What the wicked feared will befall him,
|    but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
|  [10:25] When the whirlwind passes, the wicked will vanish,
|    but the righteous is firmly established forever.
|  [10:26] As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
|    even so is the sluggard to them that send him.
|  [10:27] The fear of the Lord prolongs life,
|    but the years of the wicked are shortened.
|  [10:28] The hope of the righteous will end in gladness,
|    but the wicked will fail of their expectation.
|  [10:29] To the man that is blameless the Lord is a strong-hold,
|    but terror and ruin to those that do evil.
|  [10:30] The righteous will be unmoved forever,
|    but the wicked will have no home in the land.
|  [10:31] The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
|    but the man of false tongue will be rooted out.
|  [10:32] The lips of the righteous utter good-will;
|    but the mouth of the wicked, malice.

 [Proverbs 11] 

|  [11:1] The Lord detests a false balance,
|    but a just weight is his delight.
|  [11:2] Pride is sure to be followed by shame,
|    but modesty is wisdom.
|  [11:3] Their integrity guides the upright,
|    but the false are destroyed by their crookedness.
|  [11:4] In the day of wrath riches are useless,
|    but righteousness saves from death.
|  [11:5] The path of the blameless is smoothed by his righteousness,
|    but the wicked will fall by his wickedness.
|  [11:6] The upright are saved by their righteousness,
|    but the false are caught in their evil desires.
|  [11:7] When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes –
|    the hope of the godless perishes.
|  [11:8] The righteous is rescued from trouble,
|    and the wicked takes his place.
|  [11:9] By slander the godless would ruin his neighbour,
|    but the righteous are rescued by knowledge.
|  [11:10] When the righteous flourish, the city rejoices;
|    when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.
|  [11:11] By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted;
|    by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.
|  [11:12] A man has no sense that despises his neighbour;
|    a man of prudence holds his tongue.
|  [11:13] Who carries tales divulges secrets,
|    but a trustworthy man conceals a matter.
|  [11:14] Where guidance is lacking, a people must fall;
|    but that people is safe that is rich in counsellors.
|  [11:15] He who goes bail for another will suffer,
|    but he who abhors being surety is sure.
|  [11:16] A gracious woman obtains honour,
|    but a throne of dishonour is she who hates justice.
|    Indolent men never come to wealth,
|    but riches are won by the men that are diligent.
|  [11:17] The kind man does good to himself;
|    the cruel man injures himself.
|  [11:18] The gain of the wicked is but an illusion,
|    but he who sows righteousness wins the true wages.
|  [11:19] Devotion to righteousness leads to life;
|    the pursuit of wickedness ends in death.
|  [11:20] The Lord abhors the mind that is crooked,
|    but those who walk blamelessly are his delight.
|  [11:21] Most surely the wicked will not go unpunished,
|    but the righteous folk will escape.
|  [11:22] Like a golden ring in the snout of a swine
|    is a beautiful woman without discretion.
|  [11:23] The desire of the righteous will issue in good,
|    but the hope of the wicked in wrath.
|  [11:24] One man is generous, yet grows ever richer;
|    another is mean, yet he only grows poorer.
|  [11:25] The liberal soul will be enriched;
|    and he who waters, himself will be watered.
|  [11:26] He who holds up corn will be cursed by the people,
|    but blessings will be on his head that sells it.
|  [11:27] He who aims at the thing that is good will win favour,
|    but ruin will come upon him who seeks evil.
|  [11:28] He who trusts in his riches will wither,
|    but like green leaves the righteous will flourish.
|  [11:29] He that harms his household will reap the wind,
|    and the fool will be slave to the man of wisdom.
|  [11:30] Life is the fruit of righteousness,
|    but rapine destroys men’s lives.
|  [11:31] If the righteous are punished on earth,
|    how much more the sinful and wicked!

 [Proverbs 12] 

|  [12:1] He who loves knowledge loves discipline,
|    but he that hates reproof is a boor.
|  [12:2] A good man wins the Lord’s good-will,
|    but a man of evil designs He condemns.
|  [12:3] By wickedness no man can stand forever,
|    but the root of the righteous remains unmoved.
|  [12:4] A worthy wife is a crown to her husband,
|    but one that brings shame is as rot in his bones.
|  [12:5] The aims of the righteous are just;
|    the designs of the wicked are treacherous.
|  [12:6] The words of the wicked lurk for blood,
|    but the speech of the upright delivers.
|  [12:7] The wicked will be overthrown and vanish,
|    but the house of the righteous will stand.
|  [12:8] A man is commended according to his insight.
|    but a wrong-headed man is despised.
|  [12:9] Better a man of no rank, with a servant,
|    than one who apes greatness and yet has no bread.
|  [12:10] A righteous man cares for the life of his beast,
|    but the heart of the wicked is cruel.
|  [12:11] He who tills his land will have plenty of bread.
|    but he who pursues empty aims will have none.
|  [12:12] The wicked is snared by his wickedness,
|    but the root of the righteous endures.
|  [12:13] By the sin of his lips is the wicked ensnared,
|    but the righteous escapes from trouble.
|  [12:14] The words of a man bring forth good fruit in plenty,
|    and the deeds of his hands will come back upon him.
|  [12:15] A fool is certain his way is right,
|    but a wise man listens to counsel.
|  [12:16] A fool displays his anger at once,
|    but a prudent man hides an affront.
|  [12:17] One who speaks out the truth affirms justice.
|    but a false witness utters lies.
|  [12:18] The chatter of some is like sword-thrusts.
|    but the tongue of the wise is healing.
|  [12:19] The man who speaks truth stands forever,
|    but the false tongue is but for a moment.
|  [12:20] Hearts of deceit have the men who plan evil,
|    but happy are those who plan other men’s good.
|  [12:21] No evil thing can befall the righteous,
|    but the wicked are full of misfortune.
|  [12:22] The Lord abhors lying lips,
|    But delighteth in those that deal faithfully.
|  [12:23] A man of prudence conceals what he knows,
|    but a fool shouts his folly aloud.
|  [12:24] The diligent comes to power,
|    but the slothful becomes a serf.
|  [12:25] Care bows down a man’s heart,
|    but a good word makes it glad.
|  [12:26] The righteous departs from evil;

|  [20:25] A man is ensnared if he dedicates rashly,
|    and only makes inquiry after his vow.
|  [20:26] A wise king winnows the wicked,
|    and passes the wheel over them,
|  [20:27] The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord,
|    searching every room of his being.
|  [20:28] Kindness and faithfulness guard the king,
|    and his throne is established by justice.
|  [20:29] The glory of youth is its strength,
|    but grey hair is the beauty of age.
|  [20:30] A bad man is doomed to the lash, whose stripes
|    will cut to his inmost soul.

 [Proverbs 21] 

|  [21:1] The Lord guides the king’s heart like watercourses,
|    turning it whither He will.
|  [21:2] A man’s life may seem thoroughly straight to himself,
|    but the Lord weighs the heart.
|  [21:3] The doing of justice and right
|    to the Lord is more welcome than sacrifice.
|  [21:4] A haughty look, a heart of pride,
|    the soil of the wicked is sin.
|  [21:5] The plans of the diligent issue in gain,
|    but too much haste leads only to want.
|  [21:6] He that wins him wealth by a fraudulent tongue
|    is pursuing a breath and a deadly snare.
|  [21:7] The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
|    because they refuse to act justly.
|  [21:8] The way of the vicious is crooked,
|    but a pure man does what is straight.
|  [21:9] It is better to live on the roof in a corner,
|    than in a spacious house with a quarrelsome woman.
|  [21:10] The wicked man’s passion is all to do harm;
|    he looks on his neighbour with pitiless eye.
|  [21:11] When a scoffer is punished, a fool becomes wise;
|    but the wise are receptive, and learn by instruction.
|  [21:12] The Lord considers the righteous,
|    but the house of the wicked he overthrows.
|  [21:13] He that stops his ears at the cry of the poor
|    will find his own call unanswered.
|  [21:14] A gift in secret extinguishes anger,
|    and a bribe in the bosom soothes strong indignation.
|  [21:15] When justice is done, the righteous rejoice;
|    but evil-doers are ruined.
|  [21:16] The man who strays from wisdom’s way
|    will rest where the dead are gathered.
|  [21:17] The lover of pleasure will come to want,
|    and lovers of wine and oil cannot grow rich.
|  [21:18] For the righteous the wicked is ransom;
|    the false take the place of the upright.
|  [21:19] It is better to live in a desert land
|    than with a provoking and quarrelsome woman.
|  [21:20] In the wise man’s homestead is precious treasure,
|    but a silly man swallows it up.
|  [21:21] The pursuit of justice and kindness
|    is crowned with life and honour.
|  [21:22] The wise man scales the strong men’s city,
|    and brings down the stronghold in which they trusted.
|  [21:23] He who guards his mouth and his tongue
|    preserves himself from trouble.
|  [21:24] Scoffers men call the proud and haughty
|    who act with insolent pride.
|  [21:25] The desire of the sluggard will slay him,
|    for his hands refuse to work.
|  [21:26] Desires and petitions are endless,
|    but the righteous gives unsparingly.
|  [21:27] The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable;
|    much more when offered with vile intent.
|  [21:28] A lying witness will perish,
|    but a trustworthy witness will stand forever.
|  [21:29] The wicked put on a bold face,
|    but the upright take heed to their conduct.
|  [21:30] No wisdom nor understanding
|    nor counsel can match the Lord.
|  [21:31] For the day of battle the horse may be harnessed,
|    but only the Lord can dispense the victory.

 [Proverbs 22] 

|  [22:1] A fair name is more to be chosen than wealth;
|    men’s regard is far better than silver and gold.
|  [22:2] The rich and the poor meet together;
|    the Lord is the maker of both.
|  [22:3] The prudent scent mischief and hide;
|    the simple go on and are punished.
|  [22:4] The reward of the humble who fear the Lord
|    is riches and honour and life.
|  [22:5] On the way of the crooked lie traps and snares;
|    he who watches his life will keep far away.
|  [22:6] Train up a child for his destined way,
|    and, even when old, he will not depart from it.
|  [22:7] The rich lords it over the poor,
|    and the borrower is slave to the lender.
|  [22:8] He that sows wrong will reap trouble,
|    and the gain he has toiled for will vanish.
|  [22:9] The man with the kindly eye will be blessed,
|    for he gives of his bread to the poor.
|  [22:10] Expel the scoffer and discord will vanish,
|    and strife and insult cease.
|  [22:11] The pure in heart are beloved of the Lord,
|    and the winsome of speech have the king for a friend.
|  [22:12] The Lord is watching, alert and aware,
|    nd the aims of the false he subverts.
|  [22:13] The lazy man says, “There’s a lion outside.
|    on the street I am like to be murdered.”
|  [22:14] The lewd woman’s mouth is a deep, deep pit;
|    he who angers the Lord will fall into it.
|  [22:15] Folly is bound to the mind of a child,
|    but the rod of correction removes it.
|  [22:16] He who crushes the poor in the end but enriches him,
|    but a gift to the rich only tends to his poverty.

 [Proverbs 22] 

##### Second Collection of Proverbs #####

|  [22:17] Incline your ear and hear my words,
|    and set your heart to know their beauty.
|  [22:18] Keep them in your mind,
|    have them ever fixed on your lips.
|  [22:19] That your trust may be in the Lord
|    I teach you them this day,
|  [22:20] As I wrote for you heretofore
|    concerning counsels of wisdom –
|  [22:21] to acquaint you with words of truth,
|    and with answers for those who would question you.

|  [22:22] Rob not the poor because he is poor,
|    and crush not the weak in the gate;
|  [22:23] For the Lord will defend their cause,
|    and will rob of their lives those who rob them.

|  [22:24] Make no friend of a man prone to anger,
|    nor go with a man of passion,
|  [22:25] in case you learn his ways.
|    and get yourself ensnared.

|  [22:26] Be not one of those that give pledges,
|    of those that are surety for debt;
|  [22:27] for if you have nothing to pay,
|    your bed will be taken from under you.

|  [22:28] Remove not the ancient landmark
|    established by your fathers.
|  [22:29] Do you see a man expert in his business?
|    He will stand in the presence of kings.
|    but before obscure men he will not stand.

 [Proverbs 23] 

|  [23:1] If you sit at a ruler’s table,
|    consider well who is before you;
|  [23:2] and set a knife to your throat,
|    if you be a hearty eater.

|  [23:4] Toil not to make yourself rich,
|    desist from this your purpose;
|  [23:5] for no sooner seen than gone.
|    For riches make themselves wings
|    like an eagle that flies towards heaven.

|  [23:6] Do not dine with a niggardly man,
|    and do not fancy his dainties;
|    [23:7] for a reckoning soul has he.
|  He tells you to eat and drink,
|    but his heart is not with yours.
|  [23:8] You must spit out the piece you have eaten,
|    for it is bread of deceit.

|  [23:9] Speak not in the ears of a fool.
|    For your wisest words he despises –
|    your fair discourse is in vain.

|  [23:10] Remove not the widow’s landmark,
|    nor enter the fields of the fatherless;
|  [23:11] for they have a mighty champion,
|    who will plead their cause against you.

|  [23:12] Apply your mind to instruction,
|    your ear to the words of knowledge.
|  [23:13] Leave not a child unchastised,
|    for your beating will save him from death.
|  [23:14] It is for you to beat him.
|    and so will you save him from Sheol.
|  [23:15] My son, if your heart be wise,
|    then my heart too will be glad.
|  [23:16] I will rejoice from my soul,
|    when your lips utter words of rectitude.
|  [23:17] Be not envious of sinners,
|    but ever fear the Lord;
|  [23:18] for there is a future for you.
|    and your hope will not be cut off.

|  [23:19] Listen, my son, and be wise,
|    and walk in the way of prudence.
|  [23:20] Mix not with men that drink wine,
|    or that gorge themselves with flesh;
|  [23:21] for gorging and drink make men paupers,
|    and drowsiness covers with rags.

|  [23:22] Listen to the father that begat you,
|    and despise not your aged mother;
|  [23:25] But let your father be glad,
|    and make your mother happy.
|  [23:24] For a righteous son makes a glad, glad father,
|    and a prudent son is the joy of his mother.

|  [23:26] Give heed to me, my son.
|    Let your eyes take note of my ways.
|  [23:27] For a deep, deep pit is the harlot,
|    the lewd woman a narrow well.
|  [23:28] She lies in wait like a robber,
|    and many are they she plunders.

###### The Peril of Wine ######

|  [23:29] Who is it that cries, “Ah! Woe is me!”
|    Who is it that has quarrels and plaints?
|    Who is it that has senseless bruises?
|    And who has the dull red eyes?
|  [23:30] Those that linger over wine,
|    those that drink spiced wine with a relish.
|  [23:31] Look not on the ruddy wine,
|    when in the cup it sparkles,
|    smoothly it glides down;
|  [23:32] but at last it bites like a serpent,
|    and stings like an adder.
|  [23:33] Strange things your eyes behold,
|    your mind and your speech go a-wandering;
|  [23:34] Like one riding the sea are you
|    in the throes of a violent storm.
|  [23:35] I was struck, but I feel no pain,
|    of the blows I am all unconscious.
|  O when will I wake from my wine?
|    I would seek it once again.

 [Proverbs 24] 

|  [24:1] Be not envious of evil men,
|    and do not desire to be with them;
|  [24:2] for they cherish designs of plunder,
|    and mischief is on their lips.

|  [24:3] By wisdom a house is built up,
|    by intelligence it is established;
|  [24:4] by knowledge its shambers are filled
|    with all precious and pleasant substance.

|  [24:5] Wise men are better than strong men,
|    and knowledge is better than might;
|  [24:6] for wars are waged by wise guidance.
|    and victory lies in counsellors.

|  [24:7] Wisdom is too high for a fool;
|    so he opens not his mouth in the gate.
|  [24:8] The man who deviseth mischief
|    is known among men as a schemer.
|  [24:9] The scheming of fools is sin,
|    and the scoffer is hated of men.

|  [24:10] If you have been slack, in the day of distress
|    your resource will be scanty.
|  [24:11] Rescue those that are taken to death;
|    save those that are tottering to slaughter.
|  [24:12] If you say, “It is not in my power,”
|    he who weighs the heart, he discerns;
|  He who watches your soul, he knows,
|    and on each he will bring back his deeds.

|  [24:13] As the honey you eat, my son, is wholesome.
|    and sweet to your taste is the honeycomb,
|    [24:14] even so, be assured, to your soul is wisdom.

|  [24:15] Lie not in wait for the home of the just,
|    and do not assail his dwelling-place;
|  [24:16] for the just, though he fall seven times, will rise,
|    but the wicked will stumble to ruin.

|  [24:17] At the fall of your foe rejoice not,
|    and do not exult at his overthrow;
|  [24:18] lest the Lord be displeased when he sees it,
|    and turn His anger away from him.

|  [24:19] Be not fretful because of evil-doers.
|    nor envious of the wicked;
|  [24:20] for the bad man will have no future.
|    The lamp of the wicked is quenched.

|  [24:21] Fear the Lord, my son, and the king,
|    be not haughty to one or the other;
|  [24:22] for swift is the ruin they raise,
|    the disaster they send unforeseen.

##### Appendix to the Second Collection of Proverbs #####

[24:23] These also belong to the wise men:

|  It is wrong to be partial in giving of judgment.
|  [24:24] All men will curse and all people will execrate
|    him who pronounces the guilty man innocent.
|  [24:25] But those whose decisions are just will fare pleasantly;
|    blessings of fortune will rest upon them.

|  [24:26] As one who kisses the lips
|    is he who returns a straight answer.

|  [24:27] Set your business in order without,
|    make all ready in your fields:
|    after that you may build up your house.

|  [24:28] Bear not false witness against your neighbour,
|    nor let your lips be deceitful.
|  [24:29] Do not threaten to treat him as he treated you,
|    and to visit his deed with retribution.

###### On the Sluggard ######

|  [24:30] By the field of the sluggard I passed.
|    by the vineyard of one that was foolish.
|  [24:31] It was all overgrown with thistles;
|    its surface was covered with nettles;
|    its wall of stone was in ruins.
|  [24:32] As I looked, I thought upon it,
|    and I drew from the sight a lesson.
|  [24:33] “Just a little more sleep, a little more slumber,
|    a little more lying with folded hands.”
|  [24:34] So will poverty come upon you like a robber,
|    and want like an armed man.

 [Proverbs 25] 

##### Third Collection of Proverbs #####

[25:1] These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied out.

|  [25:2] The glory of God is his mystery,
|    but the glory of kings is investigation.
|  [25:3] Like the height of the heavens and the depth of the earth,
|    so the purpose of kings is unsearchable.

|  [25:4] Remove the dross from silver,
|    and forth it comes pure altogether.
|  [25:5] Remove wicked men from the king.
|    and his throne is established by righteousness.

|  [25:6] In the presence of a king claim not honour,
|    nor stand in the place of the great.
|  [25:7] Better be told, “Come up hither,”
|    than be humbled before the prince.

|  [25:8] Do not hastily bring up a law-suit
|    of something your eyes have seen.
|  For what will you do in the end,
|    when your neighbour has put you to shame?
|  [25:9] Discuss the affair with your neighbour,
|    reveal not his secret to others;
|  [25:10] lest those that have heard it reproach you
|    and your infamy pass not away.

|  [25:11] Like apples of gold in carvings of silver
|    is a word that is fittingly spoken.
|  [25:12] Like an earring of gold and a necklace of fine gold
|    is a wise man’s reproof to a listening ear.
|  [25:13] Like a drink cooled by snow in the time of harvest
|    is a faithful envoy to those that send him:
|    he refreshes the soul of his master.
|  [25:14] As clouds and wind that yet bring no rain,
|    so is one that boasts of gifts that he gives not.
|  [25:15] An angry man can be won by forbearance,
|    and bones can be broken by gentle words.
|  [25:16] If you find honey, eat just what you need.
|    lest, after a surfeit, you vomit it up.
|  [25:17] In the house of your friend let your foot be but seldom,
|    lest, sated with you, he detest you.
|  [25:18] One who bears false witness against his neighbour
|    is a hammer, a sword, and a sharp-pointed arrow.
|  [25:19] In a crumbling tooth and a foot unsteady
|    is the faithless man’s trust in the day of distress.
|  [25:20] As vinegar to a wound
|    is a song to a sorrowful heart.
|  [25:21] Give your enemy food, if he hunger;
|    and water, if he be thirsty:
|  [25:22] for so will you heap coals of fire on his head,
|    and the Lord will give you recompense.
|  [25:23] As the north wind brings forth rain,
|    so slander an angry countenance.
|  [25:24] It is better to live on the roof in a corner
|    than in a spacious house with a quarrelsome woman.
|  [25:25] Like cool water to one that is weary
|    is good news from a distant land.
|  [25:26] Like a fountain befouled or a ruined spring
|    is a just man who falls before the wicked.
|  [25:27] It is not good to eat much honey;
|    be sparing then of your compliments.
|  [25:28] Like a city whose walls are broken down
|    is a man without self-control.

 [Proverbs 26] 

|  [26:1] In a fool is honour as unbecoming
|    as snow in summer or rain in harvest.
|  [26:2] Like the aimless flight of a sparrow or swallow,
|    the curse that is baseless does not come home.
|  [26:3] A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
|    and a rod for the back of fools.
|  [26:4] Do not answer a fool as beseems his folly,
|    in case you, too, become like him.
|  [26:5] Answer a fool as beseems his folly,
|    lest he fancy himself to be wise.
|  [26:6] To send a fool with a message
|    is to cut off one’s feet and to drink disaster.
|  [26:7] Like the limp legs of the lame
|    is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
|  [26:8] Like a bundle of jewels on a heap of stones
|    is honour conferred on a fool.
|  [26:9] Like a thorn-stick brandished by a drunken man
|    is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
|  [26:10] All fools must suffer sore anguish of body.
|    and their insolence will be shattered.
|  [26:11] Like a dog that returns to his vomit,
|    a fool repeats his folly.
|  [26:12] If you see a man who thinks himself wise,
|    there is far more hope for a fool than for him.

###### On the Sluggard ######

|  [26:13] The lazy man saith, “There’s a lion on the road,
|    there’s a lion on the street.”
|  [26:14] As the door turns on its hinges,
|    so the lazy man in his bed.
|  [26:15] The lazy man buries his hand in the dish –
|    too weary to carry it back to his mouth.
|  [26:16] The lazy man thinks himself wiser
|    than seven who can answer discreetly.

|  [26:17] To mix in a quarrel not your own
|    is to catch a dog by the ears.
|  [26:18] Like a madman who hurls about
|    deadly fire-brands and arrows,
|  [26:19] is the man who deceives his neighbour
|    and says that he did it in jest.
|  [26:20] In the absence of wood the fire goes out.
|    In the absence of slander contention ceases.
|  [26:21] As charcoal to embers or wood to fire
|    is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
|  [26:22] Slanderous words are like dainty morsels,
|    down they glide to the innermost being.

###### On Hypocrisy ######

|  [26:23] Like a sherd overlaid with silver slag
|    is a wicked heart with glowing lips.
|  [26:24] With his lips one who hates you dissembles.
|    but he cherishes guile in his heart.
|  [26:25] When he speaks you fair, trust him not:
|    in his heart lurk hateful things seven.
|  [26:36] One who veils his hatred with guile
|    has his malice uncovered in public.
|  [26:27] He who digs a pit will fall into it;
|    he who rolls a stone gets it back upon him,
|  [26:28] A false tongue brings destruction;
|    a flattering mouth works ruin.

 [Proverbs 27] 

|  [27:1] Boast not yourself of tomorrow,
|    for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
|  [27:2] Let another mouth praise you, not yours –
|    the lips of some other, not yours.
|  [27:3] A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
|    but heavier than both the vexation caused by fools.
|  [27:4] Indignation is fierce, anger pours like a flood;
|    but who can stand before jealousy?
|  [27:5] Better an open reproof
|    than affection that is concealed.
|  [27:6] The wounds of a friend are sincere,
|    but profuse are the kisses of a foe.
|  [27:7] Honey is scorned by a man that is full,
|    but anything bitter is sweet to the hungry.
|  [27:8] Like a bird that strays from its nest
|    is a man that wanders from home.
|  [27:9] Oil and perfume rejoice the heart,
|    but sorrow of spirit does rend it asunder.
|  [27:10] Your friend and your father’s friend forsake not;
|    and in your day of distress
|  do not enter the house of your brother,
|    near neighbour is better than distant brother.
|  [27:11] Be wise, my son, and gladden my heart.
|    that so I may answer the man who would taunt me.
|  [27:12] The prudent scent mischief and hide;
|    the simple go on and are punished.
|  [27:13] Take the garment of him who goes bail for another,
|    and hold it in pledge for that other.
|  [27:14] If early in the morning
|    one loudly blesses another,
|    it is reckoned to him as a curse.
|  [27:15] An endless drip on a rainy day
|    and a quarrelsome wife are alike;
|  [27:16] he hides the wind that would hide her,
|    and his hand grasps at oil.
|  [27:17] As iron sharpens iron,
|    so a man sharpens his friend.
|  [27:18] He that tends a fig-tree will eat its fruit;
|    so one who attends to his lord will get honour.
|  [27:19] As face answers to face
|    so the mind of one man to another.
|  [27:20] Abaddon and Sheol are ever unsated.
|    and ever unsated the eyes of men.
|  [27:21] As the smelter for silver, the furnace for gold,
|    so repute is the test of a man.
|  [27:22] Though you bray a fool with a pestle
|    along with bruised grain in a mortar.
|    you will not get him rid of his folly.

###### Advice to Farmers ######

|  [27:23] Look well to the state of your flock,
|    and give your mind to your herds;
|  [27:24] For wealth lasts not forever,
|    nor riches through all generations.
|  [27:25] When the hay is removed and the new growth appears,
|    and the grass of the uplands is all gathered in,
|  [27:26] Then the lambs will supply you with clothing,
|    and the goats with the price of a field;
|  [27:27] goats’ milk enough there will be for your food,
|    and a livelihood for your slave-girls.

 [Proverbs 28] 

|  [28:1] The wicked flee, when no man pursues,
|    but the righteous are bold as a lion.
|  [28:2] By the sin of the violent quarrels arise,
|    but a man of sense will extinguish them.
|  [28:3] A wicked man that oppresses the poor
|    is a deluging rain that leaves no food.
|  [28:4] Those who turn from instruction admire the wicked,
|    but those who observe it are zealous against them.
|  [28:5] The wicked have no understanding of justice,
|    but who cares for the Lord understands it completely.
|  [28:6] Better a poor man whose life is blameless
|    than one who is crooked, although he be rich.
|  [28:7] A son that is prudent observes instruction,
|    but the comrade of profligates shames his father.
|  [28:8] He that adds to his substance by interest or increase
|    but gathers for him that is kind to the poor.
|  [28:9] If one turns a deaf ear to instruction,
|    his very prayers are detestable.
|  [28:10] He that turns the upright to wicked ways
|    will himself fall into the pit that he dug;
|    but the blameless will come to prosperity.
|  [28:11] A rich man may think himself wise,
|    but a poor man with brains can see through him.
|  [28:12] What a pageant there is, when the just are triumphant!
|    When the wicked emerge into power, men hide.
|  [28:13] No man will prosper that covers his sins,
|    but those that confess and forsake them find mercy.
|  [28:14] Happy the man who fears always,
|    but the obstinate plunge to disaster.
|  [28:15] A roaring lion, a prowling bear,
|    is a bad man who rules an impoverished people,
|  [28:16] That prince has no prudence that plays the oppressor.
|    but long will he live that detests unjust gain.
|  [28:17] He who sheds the blood of a man –
|    let him flee to a city, let none apprehend him.
|  [28:18] The blameless life will be kept in safety,
|    but the crooked life will suddenly fall.
|  [28:19] He that tills his land will have plenty of bread.
|    but idle pursuits end in plenty of poverty.
|  [28:20] A trustworthy man will be richly blessed,
|    but who hastes to get riches will not go unpunished.
|  [28:21] It is wrong for a man to be partial,
|    to sin for a piece of bread.
|  [28:22] A greedy man hastes to be rich,
|    not knowing that want will befall him.
|  [28:23] A man who reproves gets more thanks in the end
|    than a smooth-tongued flatterer.
|  [28:24] One who robs his parents and says, “It is no sin,”
|    is companion to him who destroys.
|  [28:25] A greedy man stirs up strife;
|    he who trusts in the Lord will flourish.
|  [28:26] He who trusts in himself is a fool;
|    he who walks in wisdom is safe.
|  [28:27] He who gives to the poor will not come to want,
|    but who veileth his eyes will have many a curse.
|  [28:28] When the wicked emerge into power, men hide;
|    when they perish, the righteous increase.

 [Proverbs 29] 

|  [29:1] One who stiffens his neck against all reproof
|    will be suddenly crushed beyond healing.
|  [29:2] When the just are in power, the people are glad;
|    when the wicked hold sway, the people groan.
|  [29:3] A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
|    but the comrade of harlots consumes his substance.
|  [29:4] By justice a king sets his country erect,
|    but one whose exactions are heavy destroys it.
|  [29:5] A man who cajols his neighbour
|    is spreading a net for his steps.
|  [29:6] By his sin is a wicked man snared,
|    but the righteous does shout for joy.
|  [29:7] To the righteous the cause of the poor is dear,
|    but the wicked care nothing at all.
|  [29:8] Scoffers inflame a city (with discord),
|    but wise men turn passions aside.
|  [29:9] When a wise man disputes with a fool,
|    he storms and laughs, and peace there is none.
|  [29:10] Men of blood hate the blameless;
|    the wicked seek for his life.
|  [29:11] The fool lets his temper go,
|    but a wise man restrains his anger.
|  [29:12] If a ruler pays heed to false tales,
|    his officials all grow to be scoundrels.
|  [29:13] Oppressor and poor meet together,
|    but the light in the eyes of them both is the Lord’s.
|  [29:14] If a king be faithful and just to the poor,
|    his throne will stand forever.
|  [29:15] The rod of correction brings wisdom,
|    but a child let loose brings disgrace on his mother.
|  [29:16] When the wicked hold sway, wrong increases,
|    but the righteous will gloat on their downfall.
|  [29:17] Correct your son and your mind will be eased,
|    and he will delight your soul.
|  [29:18] People break loose in the absence of vision,
|    but he who observes instruction is happy.
|  [29:19] Not by words can a servant be trained;
|    for he knows, but he will not obey.
|  [29:20] See you a man of hasty speech,
|    there is far more hope for a fool than for him.
|  [29:21] The spoiled child will end as a servant,
|    and come to grief at the last.
|  [29:22] A passionate man stirs up strife,
|    and much evil is wrought by hot temper.
|  [29:23] Pride will lay a man low,
|    but the lowly attain to honour.
|  [29:24] His own foe is he who goes shares with a thief;
|    he hears the curse, but he utters nothing.
|  [29:25] The fear of man brings a snare,
|    but who trusts the Lord is safe.
|  [29:26] Many seek royal favour,
|    but it is God who decides every man’s fate.
|  [29:27] The righteous abhor the unjust,
|    and the wicked abhor the upright.

 [Proverbs 30] 

##### Collection of Brief Discourses and Aphorisms #####

[30:1] The words of Agur, son of Jakeh, the Massaite. Oracle of the man.

##### The Weary World-Problem #####

|  I have wearied myself, O God;
|    O God, I am weary and spent:
|  [30:2] For dull as a brute am I,
|    not a man with the mind of a man.
|  [30:3] I have not learned wisdom,
|    and nothing I know of the Holy One.
|  [30:4] Who has climbed the heavens and come down?
|    Who has gathered the wind in his fist?
|  Who has tied in a garment the waters,
|    or set up the bounds of the earth?
|  What is his name, or his son’s name?
|    for surely you know.

|  [30:5] The words of God have all been tested,
|    he shields those who take refuge in him.
|  [30:6] To his words add you nothing at all,
|    lest He should convict you of being a liar.

##### A Prayer for Preservation alike from Wealth and Poverty #####

|  [30:7] For two things I entreat you;
|    deny me not, before I die.
|  [30:8] Put falseness and lying away from me;
|    give me neither riches nor poverty,
|    grant me the food I need;
|  [30:9] lest, if surfeited, I deny you,
|    and say, “Who then is the Lord?”
|  Or poverty drive me to steal,
|    and profane the name of my God.

##### Against Defamation #####

|  [30:10] To a master defame not his servant,
|    lest he curse you and you have to smart for it.

##### Four Evil Types #####

|  [30:11] There are those who curse their fathers,
|    and leave their mothers unblessed.
|  [30:12] There are others that think themselves pure,
|    yet are all unwashed of their filthiness.
|  [30:13] There are others with haughty eyes
|    and supercilious eyebrows.
|  [30:14] There are others whose teeth are swords –
|    the teeth in their jaws are knives,
|  to devour the poor from the earth.
|    and the needy from off the ground.

##### Four Insatiable Things #####

|  [30:15] There are three things that never are satisfied –
|    four that say never, “Enough!”
|  [30:16] Sheol; the womb that is barren;
|    the earth unsated with water;
|    and fire that says never, “Enough!”

##### Against Contempt of Parents #####

|  [30:17] The eye that mocks a father,
|    and scornes an aged mother,
|  will be picked by the crows of the valley
|    and clean devoured by vultures.

##### Four Mysterious Things #####

|  [30:18] Three things are too wonderful for me –
|    four are beyond my knowledge:
|  [30:19] the way of a vulture in air,
|    the way of a snake on a rock,
|  the way of a ship on the sea,
|    and the way of a man with a woman.

##### Four Intolerable Things #####

|  [30:21] Under three things the earth does tremble –
|    four she cannot bear:
|  [30:22] A slave when he comes to the throne,
|    a fool who has more than enough,
|  [30:23] a plain woman when she gets married,
|    a maid that is heir to her mistress.

##### Four Things Little but Wise #####

|  [30:24] Of the small things of earth there are four.
|    and wiser they are than the wisest.
|  [30:25] The ants are a feeble folk,
|    yet they lay up their food in the summer.
|  [30:26] A feeble folk, too, are the conies,
|    yet they make their house in the rocks.
|  [30:27] The locusts again, though kingless,
|    yet march, every one, in good order.
|  [30:28] And a lizard you could crush in your hand
|    finds her way into royal palaces.

##### Four Stately Things #####

|  [30:29] Three creatures there are whose step is stately,
|    four whose step is majestic –
|  [30:30] The lion, most valiant of beasts,
|    who in presence of foe never flinches;
|  [30:31] The proud strutting cock and the he-goat,
|    and a king who is head of his army.

|  [30:32] Bluster you not in arrogance,
|    but lay your hand on your mouth.

|  [30:33] As the churning of milk yields curd,
|    and the wringing of the nose yields blood,
|    so the churning of wrath yields strife.

 [Proverbs 31] 

##### Against Immorality and Intemperance #####

[31:1] The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, which his mother taught him.

|  [31:2] O son whom I bore, give heed to my words;
|    and observe my sayings, you son of my vows.
|  [31:3] Give not your strength to women,
|    nor your love to those that slay kings.
|  [31:4] Nor for kings is it right to drink wine,
|    or for princes to long for strong drink;
|  [31:5] Lest in drink they forget the law,
|    and do wrong to the cause of the sorrowful.
|  [31:6] But give drink to him who is perishing,
|    and wine to the bitter in soul;
|  [31:7] so that in drink he forget his poverty,
|    and think of his sorrow no more.
|  [31:8] Open your mouth for the widow,
|    do right by all fatherless children.
|  [31:9] Open your mouth in just judgment.
|    defend the poor and the needy.

##### The Ideal Housewife #####

|  [31:10] A woman of worth who can find?
|    Her price is far above corals.
|  [31:11] To her her husband trusts,
|    and finds no lack of gain.
|  [31:12] She does him good and not harm
|    all the days of his life.
|  [31:13] She looks out wool and flax.
|    and works it up as she will.
|  [31:14] Like the merchant-ships is she;
|    she brings her food from afar.
|  [31:15] She rises while yet it is night,
|    and gives her household food,
|    and her maidens their portion appointed.
|  [31:16] She examines a field and buys it;
|    with her earnings she plants a vineyard,
|  [31:17] She girds her loins with strength,
|    and with vigour she plies her arms.
|  [31:18] She perceives that her profit is good;
|    her lamp never goes out in the night.
|  [31:19] She lays her hand on the distaff;
|    her hand takes hold of the spindle.
|  [31:20] She stretches her hand to the poor,
|    and her hand she extends to the needy.
|  [31:21] She fears not the snow for her household;
|    her household are all clad in scarlet.
|  [31:22] And coverlets she has made her;
|    her raiment is linen and purple.
|  [31:23] In the gates is her husband well known,
|    where he sits with the elders in council.
|  [31:24] Linen she makes and sells;
|    to the merchant she furnishes girdles.
|  [31:25] She is clothed with strength and glory;
|    she laughs at the days to come.
|  [31:26] Her mouth she opens in wisdom;
|    kind counsel is on her tongue.
|  [31:27] She looks well to the ways of her household;
|    she eats not the bread of idleness.
|  [31:28] Her children arise and bless her;
|    her husband sings her praises:
|  [31:29] “Many daughters have done nobly,
|    but you excellest them all!”
|  [31:30] Grace is deceptive, and beauty is transient.
|    but a woman of character – she will be praised.
|  [31:31] Give her then what her hands have earned,
|    even the praise of her deeds in the gates.


ECCLESIASTES
============

 [Ecclesiastes 1] 

[1:1] Discourses, by the Speaker, the son of David,king of Jerusalem.

#### The Futility and Monotomy of Nature and Of Human Life ####

|  [1:2] Utterest vanity! The Speaker declareth:
|    Utterest vanity! All is vanity.
|  [1:3] What gain hath a man of all his toil
|    Whereat he toileth under the sun?
|  [1:4] The generations come and go,
|    But evermore the earth abideth.
|  [1:5] The sun doth rise, and the sun doth set,
|    But he panteth back to the place of his rising.
|  [1:6] South the wind goeth, and northward it circleth;
|    Circling and circling goeth the wind,
|    And back on its circling the wind returneth.
|  [1:7] All the rivers run into the sea,
|    But nevertheless is the sea not full.
|  To the place to which the rivers run,
|    Thither they run and run for ever.
|  [1:8] All things are full or weariness,
|    Of weariness unutterable,
|  With all that it sees hath the eye no rest,
|    And with all that it hears is the ear unfilled.

#### The Futility of the Search after Knowledge ####

[1:9] What has been, shall be; what has happenedalready, will happen again: there is not a novelty[1:10] under the sun. When anything occurs that one isdisposed to call really new, it will be found to have[1:11] happened already – ages before us. Nobodyremembers (to-day) the people of the olden time,and similarly the people of the after-time will notbe remebered by anybody who comes after them.

[1:12] I, the Speaker, was king over Israel in Jerusalem;[1:13] and I gave my mind to the philosophic study andinvestigation of all that goes on under the sun. Buta sorry business it is that God has given men to[1:14] busy themselves with. From my observation ofall that goes on under the sun, I have come to theconclusion that it is all nothing but an illusion anda chasing of the wind.[1:15] That which is crooked can never be straightened,
|    And that which is lacking can never be counted.

[1:16] Then I said to myself, Let me take my own case.I have amassed wisdom beyond all my predecessorsin Jerusalem, and my experience of wisdom and of[1:17] knowledge has been a wide one; but after applyingmy mind to the study of wisdom and knowledge, madnessand folly, I am convinced that this also is a chasing of the wind; for[1:18] Who is rich in wisdom is rich in vexation,
|    And increase of knowledge brings increase of pain.

#### The Futility of the Search after Pleasure ####

 [Ecclesiastes 2] 

[2:1] I said to myself, Well now, I will experiment withpleasure and indulge myself; but I discovered with[2:2] Surprise that this, too, was an illusion. I concludedthat laughter was madness and joy a sterile thing.

[2:3] I turned over in my mind how to cheer my senseswith wine – preserving at the same time, however,my habitual wisdom – and how to embrace folly,until I should discover what satisfaction may beprocured by men under heaven during the days[2:4] of their brief lives. I went in for enterprises on animpressive scale. I had houses built and vineyards[2:5] planted. I had gardens laid out and parks planted[2:6] with all sorts of fruit trees, I had reservoirs con-structed to water the trees that formed the plan-[2:7] tations. I bought male and female slaves in additionto the other that had been born in my house. I hadcattle and sheep in abundance – far beyond my[2:8] predecessors in Jerusalem. Further, I amassedsilver and gold and treasure from (tributary) kingsand from the provinces. I procured male and femalesingers and sensuous delighs – concubines in[2:9] abundance; and richer and richer I grew beyondall my predecessors in Jerusalem – taking care, how-[2:10] ever, to retain my wisdom. I refused my eyesnothing that they longed for, and I did not abstainfrom pleasure of any kind, for there was a pleasureattached to all my effort, and the reward of all my[2:11] effort I found in that. But when I looked at allthe things my hands had made, and at the effortthat I had spent upon them, it all turned out to benothing but an illusion and chasing of the wind:[2:12b] here was no profit under the sun. For what willthe king’s successor do but just what has been donebefore?

#### The Futility of Wisdom ####

[2:12a] Then I turned to the consideration of wisdom and[2:13] madness and folly, and I saw that wisdom is assuperior to folly as light to darkness; for[2:14] While the wise have their eyes in their head,
|    The fool walketh in darkness.Still, I am well aware that in their fate they are[2:15] both alike. So I said to myself, The fate of the foolshall be my fate also; and what, in that case, amI the better for my pre-eminent wisdom? So I[2:16] said to myself, Here is another illusion. For throughall time the wise man is not remembered any morethan the fool, seeing that in the days to come everyone will be soon forgotten. Alas! the wise man[2:17] dies just like the fool. So life became odious tome, because I was vexed with all that goes on underthe sun; for it is all an illusion and a chasing of the wind,

#### The Futility of Work ####

[2:18] Yes, all the effort that I had spent under the sunbecame odious to me, because I should have to[2:19] leave it to my successor; and who can tell whetherit will be a wise man or a fool that will have thedisposal of the results of all my wise and earnesttoil under the sun? Here is another illusion.

[2:20] Then I felt like yielding to despair because[2:21] of all my laborious toil under the sun; for itmay happen that a man who has toiled withwisdom, knowledge, and skill has to bequeath theresults of it to another who has done no work uponit at all. Here, in this great evil, is another illusion.[2:22] For what does a man get from all the striving[2:23] and the strain of his work under the sun? His daysare all a torture, and his business a vexation: why,even the night brings no rest to his mind. Here is[2:24] another illusion. There is, then, no satisfaction fora man beyond eating and drinking and enjoyinghimself as he works. This I saw to be from God’s[2:25] own hand; for how can there be eating or enjoymentapart form Him?[2:26] For the man who pleases Him He gives wisdom,knowledge and happiness; to the sinner, on the otherhand, He gives the task of gathering and amassing,that it may be given (in the end) to the man who pleasesGod.Here is another illusion and chasing of the wind.

#### The Futility of Human Effort in the Light of the Fixed ####
Order of the World

 [Ecclesiastes 3] 

|  [3:1] Everything has its reason appointed,
|    And every affair under heaven has its time.
|  [3:2] A time to be born,
|    And a time to die.
|  A time to plant,
|    And a time to uproot.
|  [3:3] A time to slay,
|    And a time to heal.
|  A time to tear down,
|    And a time to build up.
|  [3:4] A time to weep,
|    And a time to laugh.
|  A time to mourn,
|    And a time to dance.
|  [3:5] A time to scatter stones,
|    And a time to clear them away.
|  A time to embrace,
|    And a time to refrain.
|  [3:6] A time to seek,
|    And a time to lose.
|  A time to preserve,
|    And a time to throw away.
|  [3:7] A time to tear,
|    And a time to sew.
|  A time to be silent,
|    And a time to speak.
|  [3:8] A time to love,
|    And a time to hate.
|  A time for war,
|    And a time for peace.

[3:10] What does the worker gain by all his toil (thought[3:10] I) as I looked at the tasks that God has assignedto men to busy themselves with?[3:11] It is a beautiful orfer that He has established–evrything at its appointed time. Besides, He hasplanted in the human heart (the instinct for) eternity;only men cannot discern the whole range – from begin-ning to end – of the work which God is carrying on.[3:12] I am convinced that the only satisfaction that canbe theirs is to be happy and prosperous, while[3:13] they live. Besides, it is God’s own gift, when a manis priviledged to eat, drink, and experience happinessin all his work.

[3:14] I am convinced that all that God does is eternal;it is capable neither of increase nor of diminution:and God has ordained this, in order to inspire menwith reverence.

[3:15] Whatever is, has happened already; and whatis yet to happen, already is: for that which hasdrifted (into the past) God seeketh out again.

#### The Futility of Hoping for the Redress of Injustice in Some Future World ####

[3:16] Once more, in the course of my observation underthe sun, I saw that, in the place where judgmentswere delivered, there was injustice – yes, injusticein the very place where justice should have beenadministered.[3:17] I said to myself, Yes, but God will judge the just andthe unjust: for He hath appointed a time for everymatter and for every act.[3:18] I said to myself, It is for men’s sake, that Godmay show them in their true light, and lead them[3:19] to see that they are but beasts. For the fate ofmen is the fate of beasts: their fate is one and thesame. The one dies like the other. One breathis in them all, and man is no way superior to the[3:20] beasts. For all is but an illusion. All are on theirway to the same place. All sprang from the dust,[3:21] and to the dust they shall all return. Who can tellwhether the human spirit goes upward and the[3:22] spirit of the beast downward to the earth? So Orecognised that there is no greater satisfaction fora mn that to be happy in his work – that is hisreward; for, as to what is to happen after him–who can give him a glimpse of that?

#### Man’s Inhumanity to Man ####

 [Ecclesiastes 4] 

[4:1] Once more, I considered all the oppression thatgoes on under the sun. I saw the tears of theoppressed, who have no one to comfort them–power brutally wielded by the oppressors, and not[4:2] a soul to comfort them. Happy, thought I, werethe dead who are already dead rather than the[4:3] living who are still alive; but happier than eitherthe creature that has never been born, to look uponthe evil work that goes on under the sun.

#### The Taint of Jealousy ####

[4:4] Then I observed that all the laborious and skilfulwork of men has its origin and issue in their jealousyof one another. Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind.

#### The Wisdom of Unambitious Quiet ####

|  [4:5] The fool foldeth his hands,
|    And his own flesh he devoureth.
|  [4:6] Better a single handful of quiet,
|    And a chasing of the wind.

#### The Futility and Misery of Loneliness ####

[4:7] Here is another of the illusions that I have[4:8] observed under the sun. Take, for example, alonely man, with no one by his side – he has neitherson nor brother: yet he toils on endlessly; hiseye can never see money enough. "And yet, whomam I toiling for, and beggaring myself to happi-ness? "Here is another illusion, a sorry businessindeed.

[4:9] Two are better than one, for their toil is happily[4:10] rewarded. If, for example, one should fall, hiscomrade helps him to his feet: but woe betide the[4:11] man who falls, with nobody to help him up. Again,if two lie together, they get warm: but how can a man[4:12] get warm by himself? Again, while a solitaryman may be overpowered, two can stand up to anassailant; while a cord that has three strandsis not lightly snapped.

#### The Futility of Wisdom – An illustration ####

[4:13] A Young man that is poor but wise is better thana foolish old king who can no longer take a warning.[4:14] There was one such who passed from prison to thethrone, though in the (old king’s) reign he had been[4:15] born poor; and I obseved that every man alivethat walketh under the sun supported his youthful[4:16] successor. Endless were the people who lookedup to him as leader; and yet in later years theirenthusiasm for him had vanished. Here is anotherillusion and a chasing of the wind.

#### Warnings against Insincerity and Rashness in the ####
Discharge of Religious Duties

 [Ecclesiastes 5] 

[5:1] walk warily, when you go to the house of God:to participate in the worship with attentive ear isbetter than the sacrifices offered by fools, who areonly versed in the practice of wickedness.

[5:2] Do not be rash with your tongue, and do not letyour feelings hurry you into speech before God:for God is in heaven, while you are on earth; yourwords ought therefore to be few. For[5:3] As dreams proceed from multiplied cares,
|    So the din of fools from multiplied words.[5:4] When you make a vow to God, pay it withoutdelay; for fools incur His displeasure. Pay[5:5] therefore what you vow. Better not vow than vow[5:6] and not pay. Do not allow your tongue to involveyou in guilt and punishment; and do not have toexplain to the official that it was a case of inadver-tence (on your part). Why should you say thingsthat must provoke God to bring your enterprises[5:7] To ruin? for multiplied dreams and words bringmultiplied vanities. But hold God in reverence.

#### The Prevalence of Oppression ####

[5:8] Do not be astonished when you see a poor mancrushed, or right and justice plundered in a pro-vinced; for high officials are perpetually spying uponone another, and over them are others higherstill.

[5:9] It is in every way an advantage to a land tohave a king devoted to the cultivation of the soil.

#### The Futility of Wealth ####

|  [5:10] Who loves money can never have money enough,
|    And the lover of riches no increase can satisfy.
|  Here is another illusion.
|  [5:11] Increase of wealth bringeth increase in those that consume it:
|    What gain hath is owner save gazing on it with his eyes?
|  [5:12] Sweet is the sleep of the toiler, whether he eatmuch or little; but the satiety of the wealthyman will not let him sleep.

[5:13] One of the grievous evils that I have observedunder the sun is this – wealth hoarded up to its[5:14] owner’s ruin. The wealth vanishes in some sorryadventure; and so, after becoming a father, he[5:15] finds himself with nothing at all. Naked as hecame from his mother’s womb must he go again,just as he came. For all his toil he can takenothing away with him that he can carry in his[5:16] hand. This also is a grievous evil, that he must goaway just as he came; and what has he gained[5:17] by toiling for the wind? Yes, all his days arespent in darkness and mourning, in deep vexation,sickness and anger.

[5:18] I claim, as the result of my observation, that itis an excellent and comely thing (for a man) to eat,drink, and enjoy himself amid all his laborioustoil under the sun during the days of the brief life[5:19] which God gives him: for that is his lot. Yes,when God gives a man wealth and riches and powerto enjoy them, to take his share and be happy in[5:20] his work – this is a gift of God. Such a man willnot think much about the brevity of his life; forhis heart is touched by God to a glad response.

#### The Futility of Wealth the Power to Enjoy ####

 [Ecclesiastes 6] 

[6:1] One of the vexatious things that I have seen under[6:2] the sun to press heavily upon men is this. Takethe case of a man to whom God has given wealth,riches, honour, everything heart can desire exceptthe opportunity to enjoy it– that opportunity fallingto some stranger. Here is a grieveous and painfulillusion.

[6:3] If a man be the father of a hundred sons, and livefor many long years, but without having enjoyedany true satisfaction from his prosperity and withoutthe honour of burial (in the end), then such a man,I maintain, is not so fortunate as an untimely[6:4] birth, which, coming as a futility, departs in dark-[6:5] ness with its name enveloped in darkness, neverhaving has sight or knowledge of the sunlight.It is this, rather than the other, that enjoys rest.[6:6] Though the man should live a thousand years twiceover, yet enjoy no experience of happiness, are notboth on their way to same place?

|  [6:7] The toil of man is all for his mouth,
|    Yet the appetite is unfilled.
|  [6:8] What gain hath the wise man more than the fool,
|    Or the poor man who walks through the world with discretion?
|  [6:9] Better a glimpse with the eyes
|    Than the roaming of the appetite.
|  Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind.

#### The Futility of the Struggle with Destiny ####

[6:10] The character of what is has already been deter-mined, and the destiny of man is already fore-ordained: he cannot contend with one mightier[6:11] than himself. For multiplied words mean butmultiplied vanities; and what is man the better?[6:12] Who can tell what is good for man during his life-time all the days of the brief and empty life that hepasses like a shadow? Who can declare to a manwhat is to happen after him under the sun?

#### Counsels for Conduct ####

 [Ecclesiastes 7] 

|  [7:1] A fair name is better than precious ointment,
|    And the day of death the day of one’s birth.
|  [7:2] It is better to go the house of mourning
|    Than to go to the banquetting-house;
|  Inasmuch as that is the end of all men,
|    And the living should lay it to heart.
|  [7:3] Vexation is better than laughter;
|    For, when the face is sad, it is well with the heart.
|  [7:4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
|    But the heart of the fool in the house of mirth.
|  [7:5] It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise
|    Than to lend one’s ears to the song of a fool.
|  [7:6] For like crackling of nettles under kettles,
|    Even so is the cackle of fools.
|  Here is another illusion.
|  [7:7] Extortion maketh the wise man mad,
|    And a bribe destroyeth the character.
|  [7:8] The end of a thing is better than the beginning,
|    And the patience is better than pride.
|  [7:9] Do not be hastily vexed in thy temper;
|    Vexation doth lodge in the bosom of fools,
|  [7:10] Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?"
|    For such a question is not of wisdom.
|  [7:11] As good as an inheritance is wisdom.
|    And gainful to those who behold the sun.
|  [7:12] Wisdom defends, even as money defends;
|    But herein is the greater gain of knowledge,
|    That a wisdom is life unto those that possess her.
|  [7:13] Consider well the work of God;
|    For who can make straight that which He hath made crooked?

[7:14] In happy days be happy, and in the day of misfor-tune consider: for God has balanced the one againstthe other, in order to prevent men from discoveringanything of the future.

#### The Folly of Extremes ####

[7:15] In the course of my illusory life I have witnessedall sort of things – honest men ruined by theirvery honesty, and unprincipled men who owe their[7:16] long life to their very lack of principle. Do notbe over-pious or over-wise: why court destruction?[7:17] But neither be over-wicked, nor play the fool:[7:18] why die before your time? It is good, while cling-ing to the one, not to relax your grasp of theother; for true religion avoids the excesses ofboth.

[7:19] Wisdom is a mightier protector to the wise than[7:20] ten men who are in authority over a city. Forthere is not a single righteous man upon earth–a man who does nothing but good and never fallsinto sin.

[7:21] Further, pay no attention to current gossip, incase you may hear that your servant has cursed[7:22] you; for your conscience tells you that you toohace cursed others many a time.

#### Woman a Delusion and a Snare ####

[7:23] I subjected all this to the test of wisdom. I resolvedto acquire wisdom, but she remained remote.[7:24] Yes, the essence of things remained remote – deepdown in depths unfathomable.

[7:25] Then, casting about, I gave my mind to theunderstanding and investigation of wisdom, tosearch after her for results, and to study the folly[7:26] of wickedness and the madness of folly. And athing that I find to be more bitter than death iswoman: for she is a veritable net, with her heartof snares and her hands of fetters. The man whoenjoys the favour of God escapes her, but the sinner[7:27] is caught by her. Now mark this, says the Speaker.Putting one thing with another in order to arrive[7:28] at a conclusion – which, however, I have long andearnestly sought in vain – this at least I have dis-covered: that there is one man in a thousand–that I have discovered – but never a woman in all[7:29] that number have I found. This only have Ifound-mark it well: that men were createdupright by God, but they have sought out manycontrivances of their own.

#### Reflections upon Despotism ####

 [Ecclesiastes 8] 

|  [8:1] Who is like the wise man?
|    Who is skilled in interpretation?
|  A man’s wisdom illumines his face,
|    And a face that is harsh is transfigured.[8:2] Obey the king’s commands; but, remembering[8:3] your oath to God, do not be drawn into hastyaction. Leave his presence, and do not embarkupon any hurtful course; for a king can do any-[8:4] thing he pleases, seeing that his royal word isauthorative, and his conduct unchallengeable.

[8:5] He who keeps the commandment will nevercome to harm. The wise man knows in his heart[8:6] that there is an hour of judgment; for everythinghas its hour for judgment – and men will be crushed[8:7] beneath the weight of calamity. For they areignorant of the future: who can tell what form it[8:8] will take? No man can control the day of hisdeath, any more than he can control or restrainthe wind. In war there is no discharge. Wrongwill secure no immunity for the wrong-doer.

[8:9] All this I saw, as I applied my mind to all thatgoes on under the sun, at a time when men werewielding their power over other men to ruinthem.

#### The Futility of Looking for a Moral Order in this World, ####
and there is No Other

[8:10] Thereafter I saw wicked men borne to the tombfrom the holy place – men who usde to go aboutamid plaudits in the very city where they had sobehaved. Here is another illusion.[8:11f] Because sentence is not swiftly executed upon deedsof wickedness, but a sinner may enjoy a long life thoughthe do evil a hundred times over, men’s hearts swellwith the impulse to do evil; though sure I am that itwill be well with those who fear God – I mean those[8:13] who really reverence Him – but it will not be well withthe wicked: his life will be short as a shadow, becausehe has no reverence for God.

[8:14] Here is another of the anomalies to be found uponthe earth – honest meb who fare as if they had beenscoundrels, and scoundrels who fare as if they hadbeen honest men. Here, methought, is another[8:5] futility. Then I commended mirth – for the onlyhuman satisfaction under the sun is to eat, drink,and be merry: these are the things that shouldaccompany men during the days of the laboriouslife with God has given them under the sun.

[8:16] When I gave my mind to the study of wisdomand to the observation of the business that is trans-acted in the world – for day and night one never[8:17] gets a glimpse of sleep – then I recognised that manis impotent to discover the meaning of all the workof God that goes on under the sun. Howeverlaboriously men search, they will never discoverit. A wise man may imagine he is on the point ofunderstanding it, but he can never find it out.

 [Ecclesiastes 9] 

[9:1] For all this I laid to heart, and my heart observedit all, that the just, the wise, and their doings arein the hand of God: no man knows whether it isto be love or hatred. All that lies ahead of them is[9:2] vapour, inasmuch as the fate of all is alike – ofsaint and scoundrel, good and bad, pure and impure,those who do and those who do not practise sacrifice.Good man and sinner fare alike, those who takeoaths and those who are afraid to take them.[9:3] This is one of the vexing things that go on uni-versally under the sun, that the fate of all is alike.Besides, the human heart is full of evil: all theirlife long, madness is in men’s heart, and thereafter[9:4] they join the dead – not a man is left. There ishope for all who are in life– a live dog even is[9:5] better than a dead lion- for the living know atleast that they have to die, but the dead have noknowledge at all, and no further reward is possible[9:6] for them – their very memory is forgotten. Theirlove, hatred, jealousy, all alike have alreadyvanished, and for all time they have no share inanything that goes on under the sun.

#### The Wisdom of Enjoyment ####

|  [9:7] Go and eat thy bread with joy,
|    And drink thy wine with a merry heart;
|    For what thou doest is God’s good pleasure.
|  [9:8] At all times let thy raiment be white,
|    And let not oil on thy head be lacking.
|  [9:9] Enjoy thy life with the woman thou lovest,
|    All the days of thy fleeting life,
|    Which He hath given thee under the sun.
|  For that is thy reward in thy life of laborious toil
|  under the sun.

[9:Do] with thy might whatever thou hast in thypower to do; for nothing can be done or devised,known or apprehended, in the under-world to whichthou art going.

#### The Element of Chance in Life ####

[9:11] Once more: I observed that under the sun it isnot the swift that win the race, nor the strong thatconquer in battle, neither is wisdom rewarded withbread, nor insight with wealth, nor intellect withpractical appreciation; all alike are the victims of[9:12] time and chance. Nobody knows his hour. Men arelike fish caught in a net, or birds in a trap. Likethem men are caught in the meshes in an evil hour,when suddenly it falls upon them.

#### The place of Wisdom in Popular Esteem ####
[9:13] The following illustrations of wisdom came under[9:14] my notice, and it greatly impressed me. There wasa small and thinly garrisoned town, which a power-ful king came and invested by building huge[9:15] siege-works against it. But there happened to bein it a man, poor indeed, but endowed with a wisdomwhich enabled him to save the town. Not a soul,[9:16] However, remembered this poor man. So, me-thought, wisdom of a poor man is held in contempt, and hiswords are not listened to.[9:17] Better wise words that are heard in quiet
|    Than the shrieking of one who is lord among fools.

|  [9:18] Better is wisdom than weapons of war,
|    For one single blunder may ruin much good.

#### A Topsy-Turvy World ####

 [Ecclesiastes 10] 

|  [10:5] Under the sun this evil I have seen,
|    As ’twere the blundering order of a Ruler:
|  [10:6] The fool is set upon a lofty height,
|    While men of wealth must take a lowly seat.
|  [10:7] Slaves have I seen upon horse-back,
|    And princes walking like slaves on the ground.

#### A Collection of Proverbs ####

|  [10:1] As a deadly fly causes stench in the perfumer’s ointment,
|    So a little folly can ruin the rarest wisdom.
|  [10:2] The sense of a wise an leads him to the right,
|    But the sense of a fool to the left.
|  [10:3] As he goes on his way, a fool showeth his lack of sense;
|    And every one saith of him, "There goes a fool."
|  [10:4] If a ruler flare up in a passion against thee,
|    Quit not thy post: for composure
|    Can lull mighty passions to rest.
|  [10:8] He that diggeth a pit may fall therein,
|    And a serpent may bite him that breaks through a wall;
|  [10:9] He that quarrieth stones may be hurt by them,
|    And the man who cleaves wood is imperilled thereby.
|  [10:10] If the iron be blunt, and you whet not its edge,
|    You must use more strength.
|    He succeeds who can claim the advantage of wisdom.
|  [10:11] If a serpent bite for lack of enchantment,
|    Then the skillful charmer hath no advantage.
|  [10:12] The words of a wise man’s mouth win him favour,
|    But a fool by his lips is brought to ruin;
|  [10:13] From the first the words of his mouth are folly,
|    And the end of his speech is calamitous madness.
|  [10:14] The fool maketh many words.
|    Man knoweth not the future;
|  And what shall happen after him,
|    Who can declare unto him?
|  [10:15] The fuss of fools must weary the man
|    Who does not know his way to the town.
|  [10:16] Alas for thee, land! when thy king is a youth,
|    And thy princes feast in the early morning;
|  [10:17] But hail to thee, land! when thy king is a noble,
|    And thy princes feast at the proper season,
|    Like men and not like sots.
|  [10:18] Through idleness the roof sinks in,
|    And through slackness of hands does the house fall a-leaking.
|  [10:19] Feasts are made for mirth,
|    And wine cheers the heart of the living,
|    And money answereth all things.
|  [10:20] Even in thy thought curse not the king,
|    And curse not the rich in thy sleeping-chamber;
|  For a bird of the air may carry the sound,
|    And the thing that hath wings may declare the matter.

 [Ecclesiastes 11] 

|  [11:1] Cast thy bread on the face of the waters,
|    For after many days thou shalt find it.
|  [11:2] Give a portion to seven, yea, even to eight,
|    For thou knowest not what evil may come on the land.
|  [11:3] When the clouds are filled with rain,
|    They empty it over the earth.
|  If a tree falls northward or southward,
|    In the place where it falls it remains.
|  [11:4] He who always is watching the wind
|    Never gets to his sowing.
|  He who always is scanning the clounds
|    Never gets to his reaping.
|  [11:5] As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind,
|    Nor how the child grows in the womb of the mother,
|  So knowest thou not how God doth work–
|  He who worketh in all things evermore.
|  [11:6] In the morning sow thy seed,
|    And till evening rest not thy hand;
|  For thou knowest not which of the two shall prosper,
|    Or whether both shall be good alike.

#### Rejoice, Young Man, in thy Youth: for the Sorrows of ####
Age are Many and Sure
|  [11:7] Sweet is the light, and pleasant it is
|    For the eyes to behold the sun.
|  [11:8] For, though a man live many years,
|    All of them filled with gladness,
|  Yet let him remember the days of darkness,
|    For many shall they be.
|    All that cometh is vapour.
|  [11:9] Rejoice, young man, in thy youth,
|    And keep thy young heart merry;
|  Walk in the ways of thy heart,
|    And in all that allureth thine eyes.
|    But know that for all these things
|    God will bring thee to judgment.
|  [11:10] Put vexation away from thy mind,
|    And banish all gloom from thy body–
|    For youth and life’s dawn are illusions–

 [Ecclesiastes 12] 

|  [12:1] But keep thy Creator in mind
|    In the days of thy prime:
|  Ere the gloomy days come on,
|    And the years arrive when thou sayest,
|    " No pleasure are they to me:"
|  [12:2] The days when the sun grows dark,
|    And the light, and the moon, and the stars,
|    And the rain is followed by clouds,
|  [12:3] And the guards of the house fall a-trembling,
|    The mighty men are bent,
|  The grinders cease, being few,
|    Those that look through the windows are darkened,
|  [12:4] The doors in the street are shut,
|    When the sound of the mill is low,
|  And the twitter of birds is faint,
|    And the daughters of son are all feeble,
|  [12:5] Yea, (the old) are afraid of a height,
|    And the road is for them full of terrors,
|  The almond-tree wears it blossoms,
|    The grasshopper limps along,
|    And the caperberry is powerless;
|  For the man goes his way to his long, long home,
|    And the mourners wander about the streets–
|  [12:6] On the day when the silver cord is snapped,
|    ANd the bowl (with the) golden (oil) is broken,
|  And the pitcher is shattered over the spring,
|    And the wheel falls into the cistern broken,
|  [12:7] And the dust goes back to the earth as it was,
|    And the breath returns to the God who gave it.
|  [12:8] Utterest vanity! The Speaker declareth:
|    All is vanity.

#### A Later Addition in Praise of the Book, and, in general, of Wisdom ####

[12:9] The Speaker, besides being wise, further instructedthe people in knowledge, weighing and searching itout, and arranging it in the form of copious proverbs.[12:10] The Speaker made it his study to devise sayingsthat were at once true and attractive, and to recordthem in proper form.

[12:11] The words of wise men, as collected, are like goads,or like nails driven home; but they are (all) the giftof one shepherd.

|  [12:Beyond] these, too, my son, take warning.
|    Books are so many, their making is endless;
|    For this is the essence of all that is human.
|  [12:14] For God will bring every work to the judgment
|    That is passed on all secret things, good or bad.


THE SONG OF SONGS
=================

 [Song of Songs 1] 

|  [1:1] The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.

#### The Bride Praises the Bridegroom, modestly depreciates her own Beauty, and asks where her Bridegroom is to be found ####

|  [1:2] O for a kiss from thy lips:
|    Thy caresses are better than wine.
|  [1:3] Thy perfumes are fine in their fragrance;
|    As perfumes poured forth is thy name:
|    And therefore the maidens (all) love thee.
|  [1:4] Draw me after thee. O let us hasten:
|    O king, bring me into thy chamber.
|  In thee we will joy and be glad;
|    More than wine shall we praise thy caresses.
|    Yes, they are right who love thee.
|  [1:5] I am dark, but yet comely,
|    Ye maids of Jerusalem,
|  Like (dark) tents of Kedar,
|    Like curtains of Solomon.
|  [1:6] Eye me not strangely,
|    Because I am dark:
|    ’Tis the sun that hath scorched me.
|  Once the sons of my mother
|    Were angry with me,
|  So they set me to watch the vineyards;
|  But the vineyard that was mine own
|    I watched not at all.
|  [1:7] O tell me, beloved of my soul,
|    Where thou restest thy flock at the noon-tide;
|  For why should I wander in vain
|    And be found by the flocks at the noon-tide;
|  For why should I wander in vain
|    And be found by the flocks of thy comrades?
|  [1:8] If thou dost not know at all,
|    O thou of women the fairest,
|  Go forth on the trail of the flock,
|    Feed thy kids where the shepherds are tented.

#### Bride and Bridegroom sing each other’s Praises ####

##### Dialogue #####

|  [1:9] "I liken thee, O my love,
|    To a filly in Pharaoh’s chariot–
|  [1:10] Thy cheeks all lovely with spangles,
|    Thy neck with strings of jewels;
|  [1:11] And circlets of gold we will make thee
|    With pendants of silver."
|  [1:12] "While the king on his couch is reclining,
|    My spikenard yieldeth its fragrance.
|  [1:13] A scent-bag of myrrh is my loved one,
|    That lieth between my breasts.
|  [1:14] My love is a cluster of henna
|    In the vineyards of En-gedi."
|  [1:15] "O how fair, my love, art thou;
|    How fair, with thy dove-like eyes!"
|  [1:16] "O how fair, my beloved, how lovely!
|    And green is our bed.
|  [1:17] Our house hath cedars for beams,
|    And our rafters are fir.

 [Song of Songs 2] 

|  [2:1] A crocus of Sharon am I,
|    A lily of the valleys."
|  [2:2] "As a lily among the thorns,
|    So is my love among the sons.
|  In his shadow I sit with delight,
|    And his fruit is sweet to my taste."

##### The Happiness of the Bride #####

|  [2:4] To the house of wine he hath brought me,
|    O’erhung with the banner of love.
|  [2:5] Stay me with cakes of raisins,
|    And strengthen me with apples,
|    For faint with love am I.
|  [2:6] His left arm was under my head,
|    And his right arm round about me.
|  [2:7] I adjure you, ye maids of Jerusalem,
|    By the roes and the hinds of the field,
|  That ye rouse not love nor awake her,
|    Until it be her good pleasure.

#### A Spring Wooing ####

|  [2:8] Hark! my beloved!
|    See, he cometh,
|  Leaping the mountains,
|    Skipping the hills.
|  [2:9] See, there he standeth
|    In front of our wall.
|  I look from the window,
|    I peer though the latice;
|  [2:10] And thus my beloved
|    Makes answer to me.
|  "Arise, my beloved,
|    My fair, come away.
|  [2:11] For see! the winter is past,
|    The rain is over and gone,
|  [2:12] The flowers appear in the land,
|    The time for pruning is come,
|    And the voice of the ring-dove is heard.
|  [2:13] The figs on the fig-trees are reddening,
|    The vines are all blossom and fragrance.
|  Arise, my beloved,
|    My fair, come away.
|  [2:14] O my dove, from thy craggy retreat,
|    From thy hiding-place steep,
|  O show me thy face,
|    Let me hear thy voice;
|  For thy voice is so sweet
|    And thy face is so lovely."
|  [2:15] Take us the foxes,
|    The little foxes,
|  That ruin our vineyards,
|    Those blossoming vineyards.
|  [2:16] My beloved is mine, I am his:
|    ’Mong the lilies he pastures.
|  [2:17] Till cool grows the day,
|    And the shadows depart,
|  O turn, my beloved,
|    And sport like the roe
|  Or the playful gazelle
|    On the cleft-riven mountains.

#### The Bride’s Dream ####

 [Song of Songs 3] 

|  [3:1] On my bed in the night did I seek
|    The beloved of my soul.
|    But I sought him in vain.
|  [3:2] "I will rise and go over the city,
|    Its streets and its squares.
|  I will seek the beloved of my soul."
|    But I sought him in vain.
|  [3:3] I was met by the watchmen who passed
|    On their round of the city.
|  ("Tell me," I said), "Have ye seen
|    The beloved of my soul?"
|  [3:4] Scarce had I parted from them
|    When I found the beloved of my soul.
|  I held him and slacked not my hold,
|    Till I brought him home to my mother.
|  [3:5] I adjure you, ye maids of Jerusalem,
|    By the roes and the hinds of the field,
|  That ye rouse not love nor awake her
|  Until it be her good pleasure.

#### The Bridegroom’s Procession ####

|  [3:6] What is this that comes up from the desert
|    Like columns of smoke.
|  Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
|    All scents of the merchant?
|  [3:7] Behold, it is Solomon’s litter,
|    And round it three score valiant men
|    Of the valiant of Israel,
|  [3:8] Each with a sword in his hand,
|    And acquainted with war–
|  Every man with a sword on his thigh
|    For the terrors of night.
|  [3:9] The king had a palanquin made him
|    Of Lebanon wood.
|  [3:10] Its feet he had fashioned of silver;
|    Its back was of gold.
|  Its seat was of purple: within
|    It was inlaid with ebony.
|  [3:11] Come forth and look on the king,
|    Ye daughters of Zion,
|  In the crown he received from his mother,
|    The day he was wedded
|    With gladness of heart.

#### In Praise of the Charms of the Bride ####

 [Song of Songs 4] 

|  [4:1] How fair, my love, art thou,
|    With thy dove-like eyes
|    Behind thy veil;
|  And thy hair like a flock of goats
|    Streaming down from mount Gilead;
|  [4:2] Thy teeth like a flock new shorn
|    Just come up from the washing,
|  Ranged in a double row,
|    Not one of them lacking;
|  [4:3] Thy lips like a scarlet thread,
|    And thy mouth so lovely;
|  Thy temples like pieces of pomegranate,
|    Seen through thy veil;
|  [4:4] Thy neck like the tower of David,
|    Built for an armoury,
|  Hung with the thousand shields,
|    All shields of the valiant;
|  [4:5] Thy breasts like a pair of fawns
|    That are twins of a roe!
|  [4:6] Till the day grow cool
|    And the shadows depart
|  I will go to the mountain of myrrh,
|    And the hill of frankincense.
|  [4:7] O my love, thou art fair altogether;
|    There is no spot in thee.
|  [4:9] Thou hast ravished me, sister and bride.
|    One glance of thine eyes hath bewitched me,
|    One glint of thy necklace.
|  [4:10a] How sweet thy caress, sister bride!
|    [4:10b] How much better than wine thy caresses!
|  [4:Thy] lips, O my bride, drip with honey,
|    And milk leith under thy tongue.
|  Thy garments are fragrant as Lebanon;
|    [4:10c] Thy perfumes are sweeter than balsam.
|  [4:12] A garden enclosed is my sister,
|    And garden enclosed, a sealed fountain;
|  [4:13] Thy shoots are a pomegranate paradise–
|    Choicest of fruits,
|  Henna and spikenard,

[4:14] Spikenard and saffron,

|  Calamus and cinnamon,
|    With all trees of incense,
|  Aloes and myrrh,
|    With the chief spices all.
|  [4:15] Thou art the fount of my garden,
|    A well of fresh water,
|    Like streamlets of Lebanon.
|  [4:16] O North wind, awake,
|    And come, thou South,
|  And blow on my garden,
|    That perfume be wafted.
|  "Let my darling come into his garden
|    And taste its choice fruits."

 [Song of Songs 5] 

|  [5:1] I am come to my garden, my sister;
|    I gather me balsam and myrrh.
|  I have tasted the comb with the honey,
|    And drunk of my wine and my milk.
|  Taste ye, my friends, and drink;
|    Yea, drink yourselves drunken, beloved.

#### In Praise of the Bridegroom ####

##### The Bride tells her Tale #####

|  [5:2] I slept, but my heart was awake.
|    O hark! my beloved is knocking.
|  "Open to me, my sister,
|    My dove, my beloved, all spotless.
|  For wet is my head with the dew,
|    And my locks with the drops of the night."
|  [5:3] "I have laid my garment aside,
|    And why should I don it again?
|  My feet, too, I have washed,
|    And why should I soil them again?"
|  [5:4] My love put his hand through the opening,
|    And moved was my heart for him.
|  [5:5] So I rose to let in my darling:
|    My hands were dripping with myrrh,
|  With the myrrh that ran over my fingers
|    And on the catch of the bolt.
|  [5:6] I opened the door to my love,
|    But my darling had turned and was gone;
|    And the soul of me sank, when he vanished.
|  I sought him, but all in vain:
|    I called, but he gave me no answer.
|  [5:7] The watchmen were tramping the city;
|    They met me, they beat me and wounded me.
|  Those who kept watch on the walls
|    Seized the mantle that I had thrown over me.
|  [5:8] I adjure you, ye maids of Jerusalem,
|    If so be ye find my beloved,
|  What, then, shall ye tell my beloved?
|    That faint with love am I.
|  [5:9] "What is thy darling more than another,
|    O thou of women the fairest?
|  What is thy darling more than another,
|    That thou dost adjure us so?"

##### The Bride’s Praise of the Bridegroom #####

|  [5:10] "My beloved is radiant and ruddy,
|    The chief among ten thousand
|  [5:11] His head is finest gold;
|    His curls are as black as the raven.
|  [5:12] His eyes are like doves
|    Over brooklets of water,
|  Or bathing in milk,
|    As they perch on the brink.
|  [5:13] His cheeks are like beds of spices,
|    Like banks of sweet herbs.
|  His lips are like lilies – adrip
|    With their liquid myrrh.
|  [5:14] His arms are like tapers of gold
|    That are inlaid with jasper;
|  His belly like ivory wrought
|    And encrusted with sapphires.
|  [5:15] His legs are like pillars of marble
|    On sockets of gold.
|  He looks altogether like Lebanon,
|    Grand as the cedars.
|  [5:16] Sweetness itself is his mouth;
|    He is all of him lovely.
|  Such is my love and my darling,
|    Ye maids of Jerusalem."

##### Conclusion #####

 [Song of Songs 6] 

|  [6:1] "Whither hath gone thy beloved,
|    O fairest of women?
|  Whiter hath turned thy beloved,
|  That with thee we may seek him?"
|  [6:2] "My love is gone down to his garden,
|    The terrace of spices,
|  To pasture his flock in his garden,
|    To pasture his flock in his garden
|  And gather the lilies.
|  [6:3] My beloved is mine, I am his,
|  ’Mong the lilies he pastures."

#### In Praise of the Bride ####

|  [6:4] Thou art fair, my beloved, as Tirzah,
|    Lovely as Jerusalem,
|    Dread as an army with banners.
|  [6:5] Away from me turn those eyes
|    That stir me so strangely,
|  That hair like a flock of goats
|    Streaming down from mount Gilead,
|  [6:6] Those teeth like a flock of ewes,
|    Just come up from the washing,
|  Ranged in a double row,
|    Not one of them lacking;
|  [6:7] Those temples like pieces of pomegranate
|    Seen through thy veil.
|  [6:8] Three score queens had Solomon,
|    Concubines fourscore,
|    And maids without number.
|  [6:9] But she, my dove, is but one,
|    She, my stainless, is one.
|  Alone and peerless is she
|    To the mother who bore her.
|  The daughters, at sight of her, praised her;
|    Concubines, queens, sang her praises.
|  [6:10] Who is this that looks forth like the dawn,
|    Fair as the moon,
|    Clear as the sun,
|  And dread as an army with banners?
|  [6:11] "I went down to the garden of nuts,
|    To see the green shoots in the valley,
|  To see if the vines were in bud,
|    Or the pomegranates yet were in blossom.
|  [6:12] Or ever I knew, on his chariot
|    The prince of my people had set me."
|  [6:13] Turn thee, turn, maid of Shulem,
|    Turn thee, turn, that we see thee.
|  But what would ye see in the Shulammite?
|    (We would see her dance) the war-dance.

#### In Praise of the Bride as she dances the Sword-Dance ####

 [Song of Songs 7] 

|  [7:1] How gracefully thou dost step
|    In thy sandals, thou prince’s daughter!
|  The curves of thy thighs are like jewels,
|    wrought by the hands of an artist.
|  [7:2] Thy waist is a rounded bowl–
|    Be never the sweet wine wanting.
|  Thy belly a heap of wheat,
|    That is set about with lilies.
|  [7:3] Thy breasts like a pair of fawns
|    That are twins of a gazelle,
|  [7:4] Thy neck like the ivory tower.
|  Thine eyes are like Heshbon’s pools,
|    By the gate of the populous city,
|  Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon
|    That looketh toward Damascus,
|  [7:5] Thy head is like Carmel upon thee,
|    Thy flowing locks are as purple:
|    Thy tresses hold captive the king.
|  [7:6] How fair, my beloved, art thou!
|    How lovely in love’s delights!
|  [7:7] Thou art slender and tall as a palm,
|    And thy breasts are like its clusters.
|  [7:8] I vowed I would climb this palm,
|    And take hold of the branches thereof.
|  O let thy breasts be as clusters,
|    The smell of thy breath be as apples,
|  [7:9] Thy lips be as wine of the best,
|    That goeth down smoothly
|    And glides o’er the lips and the teeth.

#### The Bride’s Longing ####

|  [7:10] I am my darling’s;
|    He longeth for me.
|  [7:11] Come, then, my love,
|    Let us go the to the fields,
|    Let us lodge among the henna.
|  [7:12] And early we’ll hie to the vineyards,
|    To see if the vine be in bud,
|  If its blossoms have opened,
|    And pomegranates flower;
|    And there my caresses I’ll give thee.
|  [7:13] The love-apples give forth their scent;
|    At our door are all manner of fruits,
|  Precious fruits, both new and old,
|    That I stored up for thee, my beloved.

 [Song of Songs 8] 

|  [8:1] O that thou wert my brother,
|    That nursed at the breasts of my mother!
|  If I found thee without, I would kiss thee,
|    Nor fear the contempt of another.
|  [8:2] To my mother’s house I would bring thee,
|    To the chamber of her that conceived me.
|  Spiced wine would I give thee to drink,
|    A draught of my pomegranate wine.

#### The Incomparable Power of Love ####

|  [8:5] Who is this that comes up from the wilderness,
|    Leaning upon her beloved?
|  "’Neath the apple-tree yonder I woke thee,
|    Just there, where a babe thou wast swaddled–
|    Yes, there – by the mother that bore thee."
|  [8:6] "Set me as seal on thy heart
|    Like the ring on thy hand.
|  For love is strong as death,
|    Its passion is fierce as the grave;
|  Its flashes are flashes of fire,
|    Its flames are like the lightning.
|  [8:7] No waters can quench it,
|    Nor floods overwhelm it.
|  If a man should give all in his house for it,
|    Utterly scorned would he be.

#### The Bride’s Proud Reply to her Brothers ####

|  [8:8] "A sister have we, but she’s little–
|    No breasts hath she yet.
|  What then shall we do with our sister,
|    The day she is spoken for?
|  [8:9] If she should prove a wall,
|    We will build her a turret of silver.
|  But if she should prove a door,
|    We will fence her with boards of cedar."
|  [8:10] "I was a wall,
|    My breasts were the turrets;
|  And he, as he looked at me,
|    Won me my happiness."

#### The Two Vineyards ####

|  [8:11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon–
|    He let out the vineyard to keepers;
|  And each man brought in for the fruit thereof
|    One thousand shekels of silver.
|  [8:12] I, too, have a vineyard, mine own:
|    I leave thee the thousand, O Solomon;
|  Yea, and two hundred besides
|    For the men who kept watch on the fruit thereof,

#### Conclusion ####

|  [8:13] "O thou that hauntest the gardens,
|    My comrades are all attention:
|    Come, let us hear thy voice."
|  [8:14] "Hasten, beloved,
|    And flee like the roe
|  Or the playful gazelle
|    On the mountains of spices." 


The Book of the Prophet Isaiah
==============================

##### Prophecies Concerning Judah and Israel #####

#### Jerusalem: Her Present Sin and Punishment; Her Future Redemption and Glory ####

 [Isaiah 1] 

[1:1] The vision of Judah and Jerusalem, as seen by Isaiah the son of Amoz, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

##### The Prophet’s Lament over the Unfaithfulness of the People to their God #####

|  [1:2] Hear, you heavens, and give ear, O earth,
|    for the LORD  Himself is the Speaker.
|  ‟Sons have I reared and brought up,
|    but rebellious to Me are they grown.
|  [1:3] An ox knows its owner,
|    and an ass its master’s crib;
|  but Israel does not know,
|    my people do not consider.”

|  [1:4] Ah! sinful nation,
|    you people laden with guilt,
|  you brood of evil-doers,
|    you children all corrupt,
|  that have forsaken the LORD,
|    and spurned the Holy One of Israel:

|  [1:5] Why would you court more stripes
|    by straying yet further from Him?
|  The head is sick altogether,
|    the heart is all diseased.
|  [1:6] From the sole of the foot to the head
|    there is no soundness therein:
|  Nought but bruises and weals
|    and wounds that are raw and bleeding,
|  all unpressed and unbandaged,
|    all unsoftened with oil.

|  [1:7] Your land is a desolation,
|    your cities are burned with fire;
|  the fields before your eyes
|    are being devoured by aliens.
|  [1:8] And the daughter of Zion is left
|    all alone like a booth in a vineyard,
|  a lodge in a cucumber-field,
|    or a turret where men keep watch.
|  [1:9] Were it not that the LORD  of Hosts
|    had left us a remnant,
|  our fate has been wellnigh like Sodom’s,
|    or like to Gomorrah’s.

##### The Futility of a Merely Ceremonial Worship #####

|  [1:10] Give ear to the word of the LORD,
|    you rulers of Sodom;
|  and hear what our God has to teach you,
|    you folk of Gomorrah.
|  [1:11] The LORD  says, ‟What care I
|    For your multiplied sacrifices?
|  I am sick of burnt offerings of rams
|    and the fat of fed beasts;
|  blood of bullocks, of lambs, or goats,
|    is no pleasure to Me.
|  [1:12] When you gather to gaze on My face,
|    who has asked you for these things?
|  Trample My courts no more,
|  [1:13] Bring offerings no more.
|  Vain is the smoke of sacrifice,
|    to me ’tis abomination.
|  The new moon and Sabbath,
|    the call to assembly,
|  the fast and the festival
|    I cannot (endure).
|  [1:14] They weigh Me down,
|    I am tired of the burden.

|  [1:15] When therefore you spread out your hands,
|    I will hide from you Mine eyes;
|  when you make your many prayers,
|    I will not listen to you.
|  [1:16] Your hands are full of blood:
|    Wash, and make you clean.
|  Banish out of My sight
|    the wicked things that you do.
|  Cease to do evil,
|    [1:17] Learn to do well.
|  Let justice be ever your care,
|    punish the man of violence,
|  win for the orphan his rights,
|    and defend the cause of the widow.”

##### The Great Alternatives #####

|  [1:18] ‟Come,” says the LORD, ‟and now
|    let us reason together.
|  Your sins, though like scarlet, may yet
|    become white as the snow.
|  And though they be crimson-red,
|    they may yet be as wool.
|  [1:19] If you be obedient and willing,
|    you shall taste the good of the land;
|  [1:20] But if you refuse and rebel,
|    ‟Tis the sword you shall taste:
|    For the mouth of the LORD  has spoken it.”

##### Zion’s Present Shame and Future Glory #####

|  [1:21] Alas! how the once faithful City
|    has turned to be harlot.
|  She that was once full of justice,
|    she wherein righteousness lodged,
|    is now haunted by murderers.
|  [1:22] Your silver is now become dross,
|    and your wine mixed with water.
|  [1:23] Your rulers are grown to be rebels,
|    the comrades of the thieves-
|  Every man of them fond of his bribe,
|    hunting ever for gifts,
|  caring nought for the rights of the orphan
|    or the cause of the widow.

|  [1:24] Therefore thus says the Lord, the LORD  of Hosts,
|    the Mighty One of Israel:
|  “From Mine enemies who resist Me,
|    I will get Me the comfort of vengeance.
|  [1:25] I will turn My hand against you;
|  I will smelt out your dross in the furnace,
|    and all your alloy remove.

|  [1:26] Judges, like those of old,
|    and counsellors as of yore, I will give you.
|  Thereafter shall you called
|    the City of Justice, the Faithful City.

|  [1:27] By justice shall Zion be ransomed,
|    and by righteousness her people.
|  [1:28] But together rebels and sinners be crushed,
|    and those that abandon the LORD  shall perish.

##### The Heathen Cult and its Doom #####

|  [1:29] For the trees you delight in shall bring you to shame,
|    and abashed shall you be for your gardens beloved.
|  [1:30] Like a tree with withered leaves
|    shall you be-like a waterless garden.
|  [1:31] Like tow shall the strong man become,
|    and the thing he has wrought like a spark;
|  and both shall burn together
|    in a flame that cannot be quenched.

##### Jerusalem the Centre of Blessing to the World; Arbitration, Disarmament, and International Peace #####

 [Isaiah 2] 

[2:1] The message of Isaiah the son of Amoz: his vision of Judah and Jerusalem.

|  [2:2] In the after-time it shall be
|    that the mountain of the LORD
|   Shall be set at the head of the mountains,
|    and exalted above the hills.
|  All the peoples shall thither stream,
|  [2:3] Many nations shall go and say,
|  “Come, let us go to the mount of the LORD,
|    to the house of the God of Jacob.
|  That He in His ways may instruct us,
|    and that we in His paths may walk.
|  For instruction proceeds from Zion,
|    the word of the LORD  from Jerusalem.”
|  [2:4] He will judge the disputes of the peoples,
|    and for manifold nations so justly will arbitrate
|  that their swords they will beat into ploughshares,
|    and to pruning-hooks their spears.
|  Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
|    and war they shall learn no more.

|  [2:5] O household of Jacob, come,
|    let us walk in the light of the LORD .

#### Judgment upon the Wealth and Pride of Judah ####

##### the  #####

LORD ’s Judgement-Day

|  [2:6] *(Get you into the caves of the rocks,
|    and hide in the holes of the ground,
|  from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|    he rises with terror to smile the earth.) *
|  For He has forsaken His people,
|    the household of Jacob.

|  Filled is his land from the east with diviners,
|    with soothsayers like to the Philistines,
|    sorcerers, children of aliens.
|  [2:7] Filled in his land full of silver and gold,
|    and his treasure is endless.
|  Filled in his land full of horses,
|    his chariots are endless.
|  [2:8] Filled is his land full of idols,
|    he worships the work of his hands,
|    the things that his fingers have made.
|  [2:11] *So the pride of men shall be humbled,
|    laid low shall man’s loftiness be,
|    and that day shall the LORD  alone be exalted.
|  [2:10] Get you into the rocks,
|    and hide in the ground,
|  from the LORD ’s dread presence
|    and glory majestic. *
|  [2:12] For a day of the LORD  is coming
|    upon all that is haughty and proud,
|    upon all that is lofty and high-
|  [2:13] Upon cedars if Lebanon all,
|    and oaks of Bashan all,
|  [2:14] Upon all the great mountains
|    and all the high hills,
|  [2:15] Upon all the proud towers,
|    all fortified walls,
|  [2:16] Upon all ships of Tarshish
|    and all gallant craft.
|  [2:17] *Then the pride of men shall be humbled,
|    laid low shall man’s loftiness be,
|  and that day shall the LORD  alone be exalted.
|    [2:18] The Idols shall all of them vanish.
|  [2:19] Get you into the caves of the rocks,
|    and the holes of the ground
|  from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|    he rises with terror to smile the earth. *
|  [2:20] That day shall men cast away
|    to the moles and to the bats
|  their idols of silver and gold,
|    which they made for themselves to worship;
|  [2:21] *And into the caves of the rocks they shall get them,
|    and into the rents of the cliffs,
|  from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|    he rises-with terror to smite the earth. *

[2:22] Oh cease your trust in man, in whose nostrils is but a breath. Of what account is he?

##### A Reign of Anarchy #####

 [Isaiah 3] 

|  [3:1] Behold, the Lord the LORD  of Hosts
|    take staff and stay from Jerusalem and Judah-
|  [3:2] Soldiers and Warriors, judges and prophets,
|  [3:3] Deviners and elders, and captains of fifty,
|  men of distinction, and men of sage counsel,
|    cunning magicians and skilful enchanters.
|  [3:4] And boys I will give then for princes,
|    and men of caprice shall rule over them.
|  [3:5] The people shall play the tyrant,
|    each man over his neighbour.
|  The young shall be rude to the aged,
|    the man of low rank to the high.

|  [3:6] One shall take hold of his fellow, and say to him:
|    “Your family has a robe;
|  come, and do you be our ruler,
|    and take this ruin in hand.”
|  [3:7] Then will the other protest,
|    “Nay, verily: *I* cannot heal you.
|  In my own house there is no bread,
|    nor yet is there a robe.
|  You shall not thrust upon *me*
|    The leadership of the people.”

|  [3:8] Jerusalem is stumbling to ruin,
|    and Judah must surely fall;
|  for by word and by deed they defy the LORD,
|    provoking those glorious eyes of His.
|  [3:9] Their respecting of persons is witness against them;
|    like Sodom they publish their sin undisguisedly.
|    Woe unto them! They have wrought their own ruin.
|  [3:10] Happy righteous! For well they shall fare,
|    they shall reap the fruit of their doings.
|  [3:11] But woe to the wicked! For ill they shall fare,
|    their deeds shall be recompensed unto them.

|  [3:12] My people are cruelly governed,
|    extortions rule over them.
|  O My people, your leaders mislead,
|    and confuse the way you should go.
|  [3:13] The LORD  is taking His place for the trial,
|    He stands to judge His people.
|  [3:14] The LORD  summons to judgment
|    the elders and princes of His people.
|  “Yes, *you* have devoured the vineyard,
|    the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
|  [3:15] What mean you by crushing My people
|    and grinding the faces of the poor?”
|    says the Lord the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The Doom of the Haughty Women #####

|  [3:16] Moreover the LORD  said:
|    “Because Zion’s daughters are haughty,
|  walking with heads held high,
|    and eyes for ever ogling,
|  with dainty little steps,
|    and anklets ever jingling,
|  [3:17] The Lord shall smite with a scab
|    the head of the daughters of Zion,
|    and their shame shall the LORD  lay bare
|  [3:18] That day the Lord will remove
|    the finery of the anklets,
|  the net-bands and the moons,
|    [3:19] The ear-drops and bracelets and veils,
|  [3:20] The head-dresses, armlets, and sashes,
|    the perfume-boxes and amulets,
|  [3:21] the signet-rings and the nose-rings,
|  [3:22] the state-gowns, the mantles, the shawls, and the satchels,
|  [3:23] the gauzes and linens, the turbans and veils.

|  [3:24] Sweet scents shall give place unto stench,
|    and the girdle be changed for a rope.
|  And well-set hair shall be bald,
|    and for elegant robe shall be sackcloth,
|    for beauty the brand (of a slave).
|  [3:25] Your liegemen shall fall by the sword,
|    and your mighty men in the battle.
|  [3:26] Her gates shall lament and mourn,
|    as she sixtieth despoiled on the ground.
|  [3:4] [3:1] That day shall seven women
|    take hold of one man and say,
|  “Our own bread will we eat,
|    and our rainment will we wear;
|  but oh, let us bear your name,
|    and take our reproach away.”

##### Zion’s Final Glory #####

|    [3:2] In that day

|  shall the wild vegetation be glorious and fair,
|  and the fruit of the tilled land majestic and comely
|    for Israel’s sons that escape.
|  [3:3] And those that remain in Zion,
|    and those that are left in Jerusalem,
|  shall be called by the name of holy-
|    all who stand in the book of life.
|  [3:4] When the Lord shall have washed away
|    the filth of the daughters of Zion,
|  and rinsed away from her midst
|    the blood-stains of Jerusalem,
|  by means of the blast of judgment,
|    the blast of extermination,
|  [3:5] Then will the LORD  come,
|    and o’er the whole site of mount Zion
|  and over all the glory
|    [3:6] Shall cover and canopy be –
|  A shade by day from the heat,
|    a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.

#### The Vineyard with the Wild Grapes ####

##### The Song of the Vineyard #####

 [Isaiah 5] 

|  [5:1] A song will I sing of my friend,
|    a love-song touching his vineyard.
|  A vineyard belonged to my friend,
|    on a fertile hill-top he had set it.
|  [5:2] He had dug it and cleared it of stones,
|    and choice vines therein he had planted.
|  A tower he had built in the midst,
|    and a winepress therein he had hewn.
|  Then he looked for a yield of good grapes,
|    but the grapes that it yielded were wild.

|  [5:3] Now judge, you that dwell in Jerusalem,
|    and you that are freemen of Judah,
|    judge between me and my vineyard.
|  [5:4] What more could I do for my vineyard
|    that I had neglected to do?
|  And why, when I looked for good grapes,
|    did it yield only grapes that were wild?

|  [5:5] So now let me give you to know
|    what I purpose to do my vineyard.
|  I will tear off its hedge, that the beasts may devour it;
|    I will break through its wall, that they trample it down.
|  [5:6] I will make it waste, all unpruned and unweeded,
|    with thorns and with briars overgrown shall it be,
|    and the clouds I will order to withhold from it rain.

|  [5:7] For the vineyard of the LORD  of Hosts is the household of Israel,
|    the freeman of Judah His cherished plantation.
|  But instead of the justice He looked for was bloodshed,
|    instead of the right was the cry (of the wronged).

##### The National Sins: Woe! #####

|  [5:8] Woe unto you who join house unto house
|    and who add one field to another,
|  till no one has room but you,
|    and you settle the land by yourselves.
|  [5:9] The LORD  of Hosts in mine ear has whispered,
|  surely many a great fine house
|    shall be desolate and empty,
|  [5:10] For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but eight gallons,
|    and the harvest shall be but one tenth of the seed.

|  [5:11] Woe unto them that rise early
|    to give themselves to drink,
|  and to those that sit late in the evening,
|    inflaming themselves with wine;
|  [5:12] Whose banquets of wine are enlivened
|    with lute, harp, timbrel, and flute;
|  but all blind to the work of the LORD,
|    they see not the things He is doing.
|  [5:13] Therefore all unaware shall My people
|    be swept into exile afar –
|  Their nobleman dying of hunger,
|    their populace parched with thirst.

|  [5:14] Therefore Sheol with ravenous throat
|    opens wide her jaws without measure.
|  And down shall her splendour go,
|    and her noisy tumultuous rabble,
|    with all that in her was exultant.
|  [5:17] And there shall lambs graze as at pasture,
|    and fatlings shall feed in her ruins.
|  [5:16] Thus through judgment the LORD  of Hosts is exalted,
|    the holy God shows Himself holy by righteousness.

|  [5:18] Woe unto those that draw penalty on
|    by their sin, as by stout wagon-ropes drawn by oxen;
|  [5:19] That say, “Let Him haste, let Him act with speed,
|    in order that we may see it;
|  let the purpose of Israel’s Holy One come
|    so near that we recognize it.”

|  [5:20] Woe unto those that call evil good,
|    and good evil;
|  to those that turn light into darkness,
|    and darkness to light;
|  to those that turn sweet into bitter,
|    and bitter to sweet.

|  [5:21] Woe unto those that esteem themselves wise,
|    and that fancy themselves to be prudent.

|  [5:22] Woe unto those that are valiant in wine-drinking,
|    warriors brave at the mingling of drink;
|  [5:23] Whom a bribe will induce to acquit the guilty,
|    and innocent men to deprive of their rights.

|  [5:24] As fire licks up the stubble,
|    and hay is shrivelled in flame,
|  so their root shall turn to rottenness,
|    and their blossom go up in dust;
|  because they rejected the LORD ’s instruction,
|    and the message of Israel’s Holy One scorned.

##### A Foreign Army is Coming #####

|  [5:25] So against His people His anger was kindled,
|    against them He stretched forth His hand and He smote them;
|  the mountains shook, and the dead
|    lay like refuse about the streets.
|  *For all this His anger is not turned back,
|    but His hand is stretched out still.*
|  [5:26] To a far-distant nation He raises His signal,
|    and whistles for them from the end of the earth.
|  See! hastily, swiftly they come –
|  [5:27] None weary, none stumbling among them,
|    unsleeping and slumbering never:
|  The band of their loins never loosed,
|    the thong of their shoes never torn.
|  [5:28] Their arrows are sharp,
|    and their bows are all bent:
|  The hoofs of their horses are counted as flint,
|    and their wheels as the whirlwind.
|  [5:29] Their roar is like that of a lioness,
|    and like the young lions they roar,
|  growling and seizing the prey,
|    and bearing it far beyond rescue.
|  [5:30] That day they shall roar over him,
|    with a roar like the roar of the sea:
|  When he looks on the earth, behold! darkness,
|    the light has grown dark in the clouds.

#### The Prophet’s Call ####

 [Isaiah 6] 

[6:1] In the year that King Uzi died, I had a vision of the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and[6:2] the skirts if His robe filled the Temple. Before Him were standing seraphs, each with six wings – two for covering the face, two the loins, and two[6:3] to fly with; and thus they kept calling to one another:

|  “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD  of Hosts;
|    the whole earth is filled with His glory.”

[6:4] At the sound of their calling the foundations of threshold shook, and the House began to fill[6:5] with smoke. Then I said

|  “Woe is me, for I am undone;
|  for a man of unclean lips am I,
|    and I dwell in a nation of unclean lips;
|  and yet mine eyes have seen
|    the King, the LORD  of Hosts.”

[6:6] Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which with tongs he had taken[6:7] from off the altar. With this he touched my mouth, and said,

|  “See, this has touched your lips:
|    Your guilt is past and your sin forgiven.”

|  [6:8] Then I heard the voice of the Lord,
|    saying, “Whom shall I send? who will go for us?”
|    And I said, “Here am I, send me.”
|  [6:9] Then He said, “Go and say to this people
|  ’Hear ever, but understand never;
|    see ever, but comprehend never.’
|  [6:10] Make the people’s minds dull,
|    block their ears and cover their eyes,
|  lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears,
|    and their minds understand, and their health come again.”
|  [6:11] Then I said, “Till cities lie wasted,
|    with not an inhabitant left;
|  till houses hold men no more,
|    and the land is left a desolation;
|  [6:12] till the LORD  removes men afar
|    and wide tracts of the land lie forsaken.
|  [6:13] And should there be in it a tenth still left,
|    that too, in its turn, must be given to the fire,
|    like the stump of an oak or a terebinth felled.”

#### The Crisis Created by the Menace to Judah in 735 B.C. ####

##### The Prophet’s World to the Terrified King #####

 [Isaiah 7] 

[7:1] In the days Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, Rezin King of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched against Jerusalem to attack it: but they were unable to develop an actual assault upon it.

[7:2] When news reached the Court that the Aramean army was on Ephraimite soil, the heart of Ahaz and his people shook like forest-trees before the[7:3] wind. Then the LORD  said to Isaiah, “Go out– you and your son Shear-yashub – to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the[7:4] Fuller’s Field Road, and say to him: Be careful to keep calm: be not faint-hearted or afraid of this pair of fire-brands that are nothing but smoking stumps. Be not afraid of the fierce anger of Rezin[7:5] and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Aram and Ephraim with the son of Remaliah have indeed[7:6] plotted your ruin: their purpose is to invade Judah, and, after reducing her straits, to break into (Jerusalem); then, having overpowered her, they purpose to set the son of Tabeelon the throne.

[7:7] But thus says the Lord the LORD :

|  ’This thing shall not succeed,
|    it shall not come to pass.
|  [7:8] For the head of Aram is Damascus,
|    and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
|  [7:9] The head of Ephraim is Samaria,
|    and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
|  Your faith must firmly hold,
|    if you would yourselves be held.’”

##### The Great Refusal and the Sign #####

[7:10] One more I addressed Ahaz thus, “Ask the LORD[7:11]  your God for a sign – ask it (if you like) either from the depths of the under-world or from the heights above.”[7:12] “No,” replied Ahaz, “I will not ask for one: that would be equivalent to submitting the LORD  to a test.”[7:13] Then I said, “Hear then, you household of David. Is not enough for you to weary mortal men that you must weary my God as well?[7:14] You shall have a sign therefore from the Lord Himself. Behold!

|  A maid is with child, she shall bring forth a son,
|    and shall call his name Immanuel.
|  [7:15] Honey and curd shall he eat,
|    when he knows how to choose what is good,
|    and to shun what is evil.
|  [7:16] For ere the child shall know
|    how to choose what is good
|    and to shun what is evil,
|  that land shall be deserted
|    whose two kings you so dreaded.

##### Judah shall also be Ravaged #####

|  [7:17] The LORD  shall bring upon you your people
|    and on your father’s house
|  such days as have never yet been,
|    since Ephraim departed from Judah
|  [7:18] That day it shall come to pass
|  that the LORD  shall whistle for the flies and the bees.
|  [7:19] They shall come every one, and then down they
|    shall settle
|  in the steep-walled ravines and in clefts of the rocks,
|    and on all thorn-hedges and places of pasture.

|  [7:20] That day shall the Lord shave bare
|    with a razor that is hired
|    in the land beyond the River
|  both the head and hidden hair;
|    and the beard too shall be snipped.
|  [7:21] And in that day shall a man
|    keep but two sheep and a cow;
|  [7:22] Yet the plenteous yield of milk
|    shall supply him fare of curd.
|  For the fare of every man
|    that is left upon the land
|    shall be nought but curd and honey.
|  [7:23] And in that day every spot
|    where were once a thousand vines,
|  worth a thousand silver pieces,
|    shall with thorns and briers be covered.
|  [7:24] With bow and with arrow shall men come thither,
|    for all the land shall be thorns and briers.
|  [7:25] Fear of thorns and briers shall hold men afar
|    from the hills that used to be hoed with the hoe.
|    There cattle shall wander and sheep shall tread.

##### The Fall of Damascus and Samaria #####

 [Isaiah 8] 

[8:1] The LORD  said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write upon it in the common script ’Speed-spoil[8:2] Hurry-prey;’ and take (two) reliable witnesses,[8:3] Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” Then after the prophetess, through my approach to her, had conceived and borne a son, the LORD  said to me, “Call his name Speed-spoil Hurry-prey.

|  [8:4] For ere the child shall know
|    how to cry ’My farther! My mother!’
|  The wealth of Damascus, the spoil of Samaria,
|    shall be carried away to the king of Assyria.”

##### The Invasion of Judah #####

[8:5] Once more I had a message from the LORD  – it was this:

|  [8:6] “Because this people has spurned
|    the gentle stream of Shiloah,
|  and melt with fear of Rezin
|    and the son of Remaliah,
|  [8:7] Therefore, behold, the Lord
|    will speedily bring upon them
|  the waters of the River,
|    the great and mighty River
|  it shall rise above all its channels,
|    and overflow all its banks.
|  [8:8] On it shall sweep over Judah,
|    an overflowing flood
|    that shall reach as high as the neck.”
|  But (the LORD ’s) outstretched wings
|    shall cover the breadth of the land;
|    for with us is God.

##### The Futility of Opposition to Judah #####

|  [8:9] You may storm as you will, you nations,
|    you shall be shattered.
|  All you far-distant lands
|    of the earth, give ear.
|  You may gird yourselves for the fray,
|    but you all shall be shattered.
|  [8:10] You may forge your plans as you will,
|    they shall all be confounded.
|  Be your resolves what they will,
|    they shall not be accomplished;
|    for with us is God.

##### None is to be Feared but the  #####

LORD

[8:11]  These were the LORD ’s words to me, as He grasped me with His hand and warned me not to walk in the ways of the people:

|  [8:12] “Call you not all a conspiracy
|    that this people calls conspiracy.
|    Share not their fears and their dreads.
|  [8:13] But the LORD  of Hosts – it is He
|    you should count as the great Conspirator.
|    Let Him be your fear and your dread.
|  [8:14] A stone and a rock He shall prove, whereon
|    both houses of Israel shall strike and stumble –
|    a trap and a snare to the folk of Jerusalem.
|  [8:15] Many among them shall stumble and fall,
|    shall be broken and snared and taken.

##### Isaiah’s Patient Hope #####

[8:16] I will seal my teaching and fasten my message[8:17] in (the heart of) my disciples. I will patiently wait for the LORD  who hides His face from the[8:18] household of Israel; I will set my hope in Him. I myself and the children the LORD  has given me are in Israel as signs and symbols from the LORD  of Hosts whose home is on Mount Zion.

##### The Awful Plight of Unbelieving Judah #####

[8:19] When they tell you have recourse to ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and mutter, ask them if a nation should not rather have recourse to its God. Why should they consult the dead on behalf[8:20] of the living? Assuredly they shall (one day) clamour for the teaching and the message, when there is no day-break for them any more.

|  [8:21] They shall range through the land sore pressed and hungry,
|    and hunger shall curse their king and their God.
|  [8:22] They shall lift up their eyes to the heavens above,
|    they shall look to the earth beneath;
|  but nought shall they see save distress and anguish,
|    and thick impenetrable gloom.

##### The Great Deliverance and the Glorious King #####

 [Isaiah 9] 

[9:1] In the former time He brought the territory of Zebulon and Naphtali into contempt, but in the latter time has He covered with glory the ground held by the nations beyond the Jordan on the way to the sea.

|  [9:2] The people that walked in darkness
|    have seen a glorious light:
|  Those that dwelt in the land of gloom –
|    on them the light has shone.

|  [9:3] You have multiplied their gladness
|    and given them great joy:
|  The joy they made in Your presence
|    was like the joy of harvest;
|  their gladness was like the gladness
|    of men who divide the spoil.

|  [9:4] For the yoke that pressed so heavy,
|    and the bar upon their shoulders,
|  and the rod of their taskmasters,
|    you have broken as on Midian’s day.

|  [9:5] Every boot of thundering warrior,
|    every war-cloak drenched with blood,
|  is destined for the burning,
|    shall be fuel for the fire.

|  [9:6] For to us a child is born,
|    unto us a son is given,
|  on whose shoulder is dominion;
|    and this is the name he bears –

|  “Counsellor most wonderful,
|    god with the warrior might,
|  father everlasting,
|    prince of the reign of peace.”

|  [9:7] Great is the dominion
|    and endless is the peace,
|  upon the throne of David,
|    and over all his realm:

|  To establish and uphold it
|    in the righteousness and justice
|  from henceforth and for ever.
|    The zeal of the LORD  of Hosts
|    shall bring this thing to pass.

#### The Doom of Israel ####

|  [9:8] The Lord sent a word into Jacob,
|    on Israel it shall alight
|  [9:9] With a power all the people shall feel
|    in Ephraim and in Samaria.
|  They have stiffened their neck in pride,
|    in their stoutness of heart they have said:
|  [9:10] “The bricks are fallen down,
|    but now we will build with hewn stone.
|  The sycamores are cut down,
|    but with cedars we will replace them.”
|  [9:11] So against them the LORD  has stirred up their foes,
|    he has spurred their enemies on;
|  [9:12] Syrians east, and Philistines west,
|    have with open mouth devoured Israel.
|  *Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
|    but His hand is stretched out still. *

|  [9:13] But the people turned not unto Him that smote them,
|    nor did they resort to the LORD  of Hosts.
|  [9:14] So He cut off from Israel head and tail,
|    palm-branch and rush in a single day.
|  [9:15] The elders and men of repute are the head,
|    and the prophets whose teaching is false are the tail.
|  [9:16] Those who should lead this people mislead them,
|    and those whom they ought to have led are destroyed.
|  [9:17] The Lord will therefore not spare[9:11] their youths,
|    on their orphans and widows He teeth no pity
|  for each and all are profane and wicked,
|    and every mouth speaks impious folly.
|  *Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
|    but His hand is stretched out still.*

|  [9:18] For wickedness blazed like a fire
|    that devours first thorns and briers,
|  then sets forest thickets aflame,
|    till they roll in columns of smoke.
|  [9:19] By the breath of the LORD  the land was scorched,
|    the people became like cannibals.
|  [9:20] They carved on the right, yet were hungry,
|    devoured on the left, unappeased;
|  no man did pity his fellow,
|    but each ate the flesh of his neighbour –
|  [9:21] Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh;
|    and both against Judah together.
|  *Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
|    but His hand is stretched out still.*

 [Isaiah 10] 

|  [10:1] Woe unto those that give mischievous verdicts,
|    elaborate scrolls that bring sorrow,
|  [10:2] By robbing the weak of their rights
|    and by plundering the poor of their due,
|  so that widows become their spoil,
|    and orphans fall a prey.
|  [10:3] But what will you do in the Day of Assize
|    which will come like a crash from afar?
|  To whom will you flee for help,
|    and where will you leave your abundance,
|  [10:4] That you crouch not under the prisoners
|    or fall among the slain?
|  Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
|    but his hand is stretched out still.

#### The Doom of Assyria ####

##### The Two Plans – Assyria’s and the Lord’s #####

|  [10:5] Oh! Assyria! Rod of mine anger,
|    and staff of Mine indignation!
|  [10:6] Against an impious people I send Him,
|    a nation that sore has provoked Me to wrath;
|  and I solemnly charge him to spoil and to plunder
|    and trample them down like the mire of the streets.
|  [10:7] Not such, however, *his* fancy,
|    nor such the thought of his heart;
|  but his thought is the utter destruction
|    of nations not a few.

|  [10:8] “Are my captains,” he says, “not all kings?
|    [10:9] Is not Calno’s fate like Carchemish,
|  and Hamath’s fate like Arpad’s,
|    and Samaria’s like Damascus?
|  [10:10] My hand has seized those kingdoms
|    with images more than Jerusalem’s;
|  [10:11] And shall I not do to Jerusalem
|    and to her images also,
|  as I have done to Samaria
|    and to her idols also?

[10:12] When the Lord has accomplished all His work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, He will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his lofty looks. For the Lord has said,

|  [10:13] By the strength of my hand have I done it,
|    and by my cunning discernment,
|  removing the bounds of the nations,
|    and plundering their treasures.
|  I have brought down cities to ashes,
|    to dust those that dwell therein.
|  [10:14] I thrust my hand in the wealth
|    of the nations, as into a nest;
|  and all the earth have I gathered
|    as one gathers eggs that are left:
|  There was not a wing that fluttered,
|    none opened the mouth or chirped.”

|  [10:15] Shall an axe boast over the man that wields it,
|    or saw treat with insolence him that handles it?
|  As if ever a rod could swing him that lifts it,
|    or staff of wood could brandish a man!

##### The Fate of Assyria and Judah #####

|  [10:16] So into his fat shall the Lord
|    the LORD  of Hosts send leanness,
|  and under his splendour a burning
|    shall burn like the burning of fire.
|  [10:17] That flaming fire is the Holy One,
|    he that is Israel’s Light;
|  it shall blaze and devour his thorns
|    and his briers in a single day.
|  [10:18] His glorious forest and gardens
|    shall vanish, body and soul,
|    like a sick man pinning away;
|  [10:19] And his forest trees that are left
|    shall be few, that a child may record them.

|  [10:20] That day it shall come to pass,
|    that no more shall the remnant of Jacob
|  or those that escape of the household of Israel
|    lean upon him that smote them:
|  They shall loyally lean on the LORD,
|    the Holy One of Israel.
|  [10:21] A remnant shall return,
|    even a remnant of Jacob,
|    unto the mighty God.
|  [10:22] For though your people, O Israel,
|    be even as the sand of the sea,
|    but the remnant of them shall return.
|  Destruction is decreed,
|    breaking in like a flood of judgment.
|  For destruction, fixed and final,
|    the LORD  of Hosts will accomplish
|    in the midst of all the earth.

##### The Consolation of Zion: Assyria will assuredly fall #####

|  [10:24] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD,
|    “You My people who dwell in Zion,
|  be not afraid of Assyria,
|    who smites you with the sword,
|  and lifted this staff against you
|    as Egypt did not old.
|  [10:25] For yet a little while,
|    my fury will be spent,
|    and Mine Anger shall have an end.
|  [10:26] Over him shall the LORD  brandish
|    a scourge like that which smote
|    upon Median at Raven’s Rock.
|  And that rod of His over the sea –
|    he will lift it up once more
|    as He did against Egypt of old.
|  [10:27] His burden shall pass from your shoulder,
|    his yoke press your neck no more.
|  From Rimmon he has gone up
|  [10:28] He has come as far as Ai,
|  through Migron he has passed,
|    he has stored his baggage at Michmash,
|  [10:29] He has gone across the pass,
|    he has bivouacked in Geber.
|  Raman is all a-tremble,
|    gibeah of Saul is in flight.
|  [10:30] You people of Gallim, shriek;
|    listen, O Laishah;
|  answer her, Anathoth;
|  [10:31] Madmenah takes to flight.
|  The people of Gebin seek refuge.
|  [10:32] This day he will halt at Nob.
|  He shakes his fist against
|    the Mount of the daughter of Zion,
|    the hill of Jerusalem.

|  [10:33] But see! the Lord the LORD  of Hosts
|    is lopping the branches with fearful crash;
|    and those that were lofty are now laid low.
|  [10:34] He strikes with His axe the wild thickets away,
|    and Lebanon’s glorious cedar are fallen.

#### The Bliss of Israel in the Latter Days ####

##### The Messianic King and Kingdom #####

 [Isaiah 11] 

|  [11:1] There shall come forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse,
|    and out of his roots shall a branch sprout forth.
|  [11:2] The LORD ’s own spirit shall rest upon him –
|    the spirit of wisdom and insight,
|  the spirit of counsel and might,
|    of the knowledge and fear of the LORD .
|  [11:3] He will not judge after the sight of his eyes,
|    nor decide by the words that are poured in his ears;
|  [11:4] But with justice shall he deal with the cause of the helpless,
|    the case of the poor he will settle with equity.
|  With the rod of his mouth he will smite the tyrant,
|    and slay the unjust with the breath of his lips.
|  [11:5] His loins shall be girt with the girdle of justice,
|    his waist shall be bound with the circlet of faithfulness.

|  [11:6] The wolf shall lodge with the lamb,
|    and the leopard lie down with the kid;
|  and the calf and the lion together shall graze,
|    and a little chid shall lead them.
|  [11:7] The cow and the bear shall be friends,
|    and their young ones shall lie down together,
|    the Lion shall eat straw like the ox.
|  [11:8] The suckling shall play o’er the hole of the asp,
|    and the weaned child trot in the lair of the viper.
|  [11:9] None shall do hurt or havoc
|    on all My holy mountain:
|  For then shall the earth be filled
|    with the knowledge of the LORD,
|    as the waters cover sea.

##### The Triumphant Return #####

|  [11:10] That day it shall come to pass,
|  that the Root of Jesse who stands
|    as ensign to the peoples –
|  To him shall the nations resort,
|    and his resting-place shall be glorious.
|  [11:11] That day shall again lift His hand
|  to recover the rest of His folk
|    that are left in Assyria and Egypt,
|  in Pathros, in Cush, and in Elam,
|    in Shinar and Hamath and lands by the sea.
|  [11:12] He will raise for the nations a signal,
|    and gather the outcast of Israel,
|  and Judah’s dispersed shall assemble
|    from all the four corners of earth.

|  [11:13] All envy of Ephraim shall vanish,
|    cut off shall be all that vex Judah.
|  No longer shall Ephraim be jealous of Judah,
|    nor Judah be hostile of Ephraim.
|  [11:14] They shall swoop down the slope of the Philistines westward,
|    and plunder together the sons of the East;
|  they shall lay a stern hand upon Edom and Moab,
|    and bring to subjection the children of Ammon.
|  [11:15] The LORD  will also dry up
|    the tongue of the sea of Egypt;
|  with the fiery glow of His breath
|  he will swing His hand over the River,
|  and smite it to seven streams
|    such that men may go over in sandals.
|  [11:16] And such of His folk as are left
|    shall return from Assyria on a highway
|  like that on which Israel trod
|    on the day he came up out of Egypt.

##### The Song of Thanksgiving #####

 [Isaiah 12] 

|  [12:1] In that day you shall say,
|  “I give You thanks, O LORD ;
|    for though You were angry with me,
|  thine anger is turned away
|    and you have comforted me.
|  [12:2] See! God is my salvation,
|    I trust Him unafraid.
|  For my strength and my song is the LORD,
|    and He is become my salvation.”

|  [12:3] With joy shall you draw water
|    from the fountains of salvation.
|  [12:4] And in that day shall you say,
|    “Give thanks to the LORD  and call on His name.
|  Make know to the nations what things He has done,
|    record that His name is exalted on high.
|  [12:5] To the LORD  make music, for He has wrought
|    proudly;
|    let this be made known through the length of the world.
|  Lift up your voices, you dwellers in Zion;
|    for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”

#### Prophecy Concerning Babylon ####

##### The Doom of Babylon #####

 [Isaiah 13] 

[13:1] Oracle on Babylon: a vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz.

|  [13:2] On a bare height raise the signal,
|    and cry aloud to them.
|  Wave you the hand that they enter
|    the gates of those lordly men.
|  [13:3] I have myself commissioned
|    my consecrated servants
|    to execute Mine anger.
|  Yea, I have summoned My warriors,
|    my proudly exultant ones.
|  [13:4] Hark! on the hills a tumult
|    as of a mighty multitude.
|  Hark! it’s the roar of kingdoms,
|    of nations gathering together.
|  The LORD  of Hosts is mustering
|    his army for the battle.

|  [13:5] They come from a distant land,
|    from the uttermost end of heaven –
|  The LORD, with His weapons of wrath,
|    to ruin all the earth.
|  [13:6] Wail! for the day of the LORD  is nigh,
|    like destruction from God Almighty it cometh.
|  [13:7] All hands shall therefore hang helpless,
|    each mortal heart will melt,
|  [13:8] And men will be confounded.
|  Taken with throes and pangs,
|    they shall writhe like a woman in travail.
|  They shall look on each other astonished,
|    with faces all aflame.

|  [13:9] Behold! the LORD  cometh,
|    with wrath and hot anger cruel,
|  to make earth a desolation
|    and destroy the sinners upon it.
|  [13:10] The heavens and their constellations
|    shall not flash any light;
|  the sun shall be dark when it rises,
|    no light of moon shall shine.
|  [13:11] I will punish the world for its evil,
|    the godless for their guilt;
|  I will still the conceit of the arrogant,
|    the tyrant’s pride lay low.
|  [13:12] And men shall be rarer than gold,
|    yea, mortals than gold of Ophir.

|  [13:13] The heavens shall therefore tremble,
|    and the earth quake out of her place,
|  at the wrath of the LORD  of Hosts
|    in the day of the heat of His anger.
|  [13:14] And then, like a hunted gazelle,
|    or like sheep that have no one to fold them,
|  shall each set his face to his people,
|    and each to his own land flee.
|  [13:15] Whoso is found shall be stabbed,
|    by the sword shall he fall who is caught.
|  [13:16] Their babes shall be dashed in pieces
|    before their very eyes;
|  their houses shall be plundered,
|    and ravished their wives shall be.

|  [13:17] Behold! I already am stirring
|    the people of Media against them:
|  No thought have they of silver,
|    no pleasure take they in gold.
|  [13:18] (They grasp their) bows (and spears,
|    fearful are they and cruel;
|  they shall smite) the young men (all,
|    and the maids) shall be dashed in pieces.
|  To the fruit of the womb they are ruthless,
|    and children they eye without pity.
|  [13:19] Thus Babylon, fairest of kingdoms,
|    the glory and pride of Chaldea,
|  shall perish with doom like the doom
|    to which God hurled Gomorrah and Sodom.

|  [13:20] For ever shall she be desolate,
|    tenantless age after age.
|  No Arab shall pitch his tent there,
|    no shepherd shall fold his flock there;
|  [13:21] But there shall wild cats lie,
|    and their homes shall be crowded with jackals.
|  And there shall ostriches dwell,
|    and there shall satyrs dance,
|  [13:22] Hyenas shall howl in her castles,
|    and wolves in her halls of delight.
|  Her time is wellnigh come,
|    her day lasts not much longer.

##### Song of Triumph over the Fall of Babylon’s King #####

 [Isaiah 14] 

[14:1] For the LORD  will take pity on Jacob, He will elect Israel once more and settle them on their own land: resident aliens will join them and attach themselves to the household[14:2] of Jacob. (Alien) people will take them and bring them to their place; and the household of Israel shall employ them in the LORD ’s land as men-servants and maid-servants, thus reducing their erstwhile captors to captivity, and lording it over those who had been their taskmasters.

[14:3] Then, in the day that the LORD  gives you rest from your toil and turmoil and from the hard service that was[14:4] laid upon you, you shall take up this taunt-song over the King of Babylon, and say:

|  How still the oppressor is grown!
|    How still is the insolent raging!
|  [14:5] The LORD  has broken the staff
|    of the godless, the sceptre of tyrants,
|  [14:6] That smote the peoples in fury
|    with unremitting stroke,
|  that trod down the nations in anger
|    with unrelenting tread.
|  [14:7] All earth is at rest, is quiet,
|    they break into happy cries.
|  [14:8] Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at they fate,
|    and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
|  “Since you have been laid low,
|    no woodsman is come to destroy us.”

|  [14:9] Sheol beneath is a-quiver,
|    awaiting your arrival;
|  she rousted the shades to greet the –
|    all that were chieftains on earth.
|  All the kings of the nations
|    she bids arise from their thrones.
|  [14:10] All of them lift up their voices,
|    and thus they say unto you:
|  “So you, too, are feeble as we;
|    you are become like us.”
|  [14:11] Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol –
|    the strumming of your lutes:
|  Beneath you the maggots are spread,
|    your coverlet is worms.

|  [14:12] How are you fallen from heaven,
|    you radiant son of the morning!
|  How are you struck to the ground,
|    lying stiff, a corpse upon corpses.
|  [14:13] And you, you did say in your heart,
|    “Into heaven I will ascend;
|  I will set my throne on high
|    above the stars of God,
|  and sit on the sacred Mountain
|    in the uttermost parts of the north.
|  [14:14] I will climb above the cloud-peaks,
|    and rival the Most High.”
|  [14:15] But down you are brought to Sheol,
|    to the very depths of the pit.

|  [14:16] They that see you shall gaze and gaze,
|    they shall ask with eyes intent,
|  “Is this the man that startled the earth
|    and sent tremors through her kingdoms;
|  [14:17] That made the world like a desert,
|    and overthrew her cities;
|  that left not his prisoners free,
|    to return each man to his home?”
|  [14:18] Now in their honoured tombs
|    all the kings of the nations are lying;
|  [14:19] But you are cast forth, tombless,
|    like a hateful untimely birth,
|  clothed upon with the slain,
|    whose bodies the sword has pierced,
|  that go down to the floor of the pit,
|    like a carcase trodden under foot.
|  [14:20] You shall not be joined unto them
|    in the place where they lie buried;
|  because you have ruined your land,
|    your people you have slaughtered.
|  May it never be named again –
|    the race of this evil-doer.
|  [14:21] Get ready the knife for his sons,
|    to atone for the guilt of their father;
|  lest they rise and posses the earth,
|    and fill the face of the world.

[14:22] I will rise up against them, says the LORD  of Hosts, cut off from Babylon record and remnant, kith and kin, says the LORD . And I will make it a possession of the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, says the LORD  of Hosts.

#### The Lord’s Invincible World-Plan ####

[14:24] The LORD  of Hosts has sworn this oath:

|  My plan shall most surely be done,
|    and the thing that I purposed shall stand.
|  [14:25] On the land that is Mine I will shatter Assyria,
|    and trample him down on My mountains.
|  His yoke shall oppress them no more,
|    and his burden shall pass from their shoulders
|  [14:26] This is the purpose formed
|    to humble all the earth;
|  and this is the Hand outstretched
|    against the nations all.
|  [14:27] For who can bring to nought
|    what the LORD  of Hosts has purposed?
|  And when His is the Hand that is outstretched,
|    who can turn it back?

#### Warning to Philistia ####

[14:28] In the year that King Ahaz died, came this oracle:

|  [14:29] Rejoice not, you Philistines all,
|    that the rod that has scourged you is broken;
|  for an asp from the root of the root of the serpent shall issue,
|    its fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

|  [14:30] For the poor shall feed on My meadows,
|    the needy shall lie down secure;
|  but your seed I will kill with famine,
|    your remnant I will slay.

|  [14:31] Wail, you gates; and shriek, you cities:
|    Melt with fear, you Philistines all.
|  For out of the north cometh smoke (of war),
|    in the ranks of the foe shall no straggler be found.
|  [14:32] What answer shall (Judah) make
|    to the envoys of that nation?
|  That “the LORD  Himself is the founder of Zion,
|    and there do His suffering people find refuge.”

#### Lament over Moab ####

 [Isaiah 15] 

[15:1] Oracle on Moab

|  Alas! in a night has AR-Moab
|    been wasted and ruined.
|  Alas! in a night has Kir-Moab
|    been wasted and ruined.
|  [15:2] Gone up is the daughter of Dibon
|    to weep on the heights;
|  on the summits of Nebo and Medeba
|    moab wails.
|  On every head there is baldness,
|    and beards are all shorn.
|  [15:3] On her streets they have girt them with sackcloth,
|    on roofs is lament;
|  on her squares, one and all they are wailing
|    with torrents of tears.
|  [15:4] Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
|    and their cry reaches Jahaz;
|  whereat Moab’s loins fall a-quiver,
|    the soul of her quivers.
|  [15:5] My heart cruet out for Moab,
|    they flee towards Zoar; They climb the ascent unto Luhith.
|    And weep as they go;
|  they raise on the way to Horonaim
|    a cry of destruction.
|  [15:6] For ruin has clean overtaken
|    the waters of Nimrim;
|  the herbage is gone, the grass withered,
|    and verdure is none.

|  [15:7] So they bring o’er the Brook of the Willows
|    their riches and stores;
|  [15:8] For the cry (of despair) has gone round
|    all the borders of Moab;
|  the wail thereof reaches Eglaim,
|    it reaches Beer-elim.
|  [15:9] For the waters of Dimon are bloody.
|    Yet more will I bring upon Dimon –
|  A lion on those that escape
|    and are left out of Moab.

 [Isaiah 16] 

|  [16:2] And then at the fords of the Arnon
|    the daughters of Moab
|  shall flutter like birds, and shall fly
|    as when nestlings are scattered.
|  [16:1] Tribute of lambs they despatched.
|    To the lord of the land,
|  from the Sela, by way of the wilderness,
|    unto Mount Zion.
|  [16:3] “Grant us the laid of you counsel,
|    and mediate (for us);
|  shelter us as in the noon-tide
|    with shade deep as night.
|  Bring into shelter the outcasts,
|    betray no the fugitives;
|  [16:4] Suffer the outcasts of Moab
|    to dwell in your land.
|  Be you a shelter to them
|    from the face of the spoiler.”

|  When the ruthless are brought to an end,
|    and the spoiler has ceased;
|  when the heel of the tyrant has vanished
|    clean out of the land;
|  [16:5] Then the throne shall be established by kindness,
|    and on it shall sit
|  in the tent of King David in faithfullness
|    one who will judge
|  with a spirit intent on the right
|    and on promptness of justice.
|  [16:6] We have heard of the pride of Moab,
|    the utterly proud –
|  Of her haughty and insolent pride,
|    and her prating all baseless.
|  [16:7] So Moab for Moab is wailing,
|    she wails altogether;
|  yea, utterly stricken they moan
|    for the cakes of Kir-heres.
|  [16:8] The vine-tracts of Heshbon are withered,
|    the vineyards of Sabah,
|  whose choice red wine has laid low
|    many a lord of the nations.
|  Her cluster did stretch unto Jazer,
|    they strayed to the desert.
|  Her tendrils were spread far abroad,
|    they passed over the sea.

|  [16:9] So I share in the weeping of Jazer
|    for the vineyards of Sibmah;
|  I drench you with my tears,
|    o Heshbon and Elealeh:
|  For over your grapes and your vintage
|    the war-cry is fallen.
|  [16:10] From the land of gardens is vanished
|    all gladness and joy;
|  there resounds no cry in the vineyards,
|    no shout any more;
|  no wine in the presses is trodden,
|  the shouting is stilled.
|  [16:11] so my soul like a harp makes moaning for Moab,
|    and my heart for Kir-heres.
|  [16:12] When Moab appears on the heights
|    and makes herself weary,

#### Prophecy Concerning Damascus and Northern Israel ####

##### The Destruction of Damascus #####

 [Isaiah 17] 

[17:1] Oracle on Damascus

|  See! soon shall Damascus no more be a city,
|    but only ruin, forsaken for ever.
|  [17:2] To the grazing of flocks shall her cities be given,
|    and there shall they lie, with not one to affright them.
|  [17:3] The fortress shall vanish from Ephraim,
|    and the dynasty from Damascus.
|  The remnant of Aram shall perish,
|    their fate shall be Israel’s fate,
|    says the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The Doom of Israel #####

|  [17:4] That day it shall come to pass
|  that the glory of Jacob shall pale,
|    and the fat of his flesh shall be wasted;
|  [17:5] Or like gleanings it shall be,
|    when a reaper gathers the corn,
|  and his arm reaps the ears –
|    the ears of corn that are gleaned
|    in the valley of Rephaim;
|  [17:6] Or the gleanings that are left
|    when an olive-tree has been beaten –
|  A berry or two on the uppermost branch,
|    four of five on the boughs of a fruit tree:
|    Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel.
|  [17:7] In that day men shall look to their Maker,
|    and turn their eyes unto Israel’s Holy One;
|  [17:8] Not to the work of their hands shall they look,
|    nor to things that their fingers have made shall they turn.
|  [17:9] That day shall your cities deserted be
|    like the derelict cities of Hivite and Amorite.
|  [17:10] Because you forgot the God who had helped you,
|    and did not remember the Rock of your Refuge;
|  though you planted Adonis’ gardens,
|    and stocked them with alien slips;
|  [17:11] Though you fence them the day they are set,
|    and next morn bring your seedlings to blossom:
|  Your harvest shall vanish away
|    in the day of your sickness and desperate pain.

#### The Speedy Doom of the Assyrians ####

##### Their Sudden Destruction #####

|  [17:12] Ha!
|  The uproar of peoples many!
|    They roar like the roar of the sea:
|  The thunder of mighty nations,
|    they thunder as Ocean thunders.
|  [17:13] But the LORD  shall rebuke them,
|    and far they shall flee, pursued
|  like chaff on the hills before wind,
|    or like dust in the face of the hurricane.
|  [17:14] At even-tide, lo! terror:
|    Ere morning they are gone.
|  Such is the fate of those that despoil us,
|    the lot of those that plunder us.

##### Isaiah’s Answer to the Ethiopian Ambassadors #####

 [Isaiah 18] 

|  [18:1] Ah, land of the buzzing of wings
|    beyond the rivers of Cush,
|  [18:2] That despatches ambassadors over the sea
|    in vessels of reed on the face of the waters.
|  ‟Depart, you messengers fleet,
|    to your tall and bronze-skinned people,
|    whose land is divided by rivers –
|  Your nation strong and victorious,
|    dreaded both near and far.
|  [18:3] All you that inhabit the world,
|    and dwell upon the earth:
|  When a signal is raised, beware,
|    and hark, when the trumpet is blown.

|  [18:4] For thus says the LORD  to me,
|    ’From My place I watch untroubled,
|  still as shimmering heat in sunshine,
|    or dew-clouds in time of harvest.’
|  [18:5] For before the harvest, when blossom is over,
|    and the berry becomes a ripening grape,
|  he will lop off the branches with pruning-hooks,
|    he will server the tendrils and cast them away.
|  [18:6] They shall all be left to the beasts of the land,
|    to the ravenous birds that haunt the mountains;
|  all summer the ravenous birds shall devour them,
|    all winter the beasts of the land shall consume them.”

[18:7] At that time shall a gift of homage be brought to the LORD  of Hosts from that tall and bronze-skinned people, whose land is divided by rivers – that nation strong and victorious, dreaded near and far – to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD  of Hosts.

#### The Destiny of Egypt ####

##### The Disaster of Egypt #####

Oracle on Egypt

 [Isaiah 19] 

|  [19:1] Behold! on swift cloud riding
|    the LORD  is coming to Egypt:
|  The idols of Egypt shall quake at His presence,
|    the heart of Egypt shall melt within her.

|  [19:2] I will spur on Egypt to fight against Egypt,
|    brother with brother, and neighbour with neighbour,
|    city with city, and kingdom with kingdom.

|  [19:3] Then will Egypt be drained of the spirit within her,
|    and I will confound her counsels:
|  To idols and muttering wraiths they shall seek,
|    to ghosts and familiar spirits.

|  [19:4] And I will deliver Egypt
|    into a stern lord’s hands;
|  a king that is fierce shall rule over her,
|    saithe the Lord the LORD  of Hosts.

|  [19:5] And the sea shall be drained of its water,
|    the river be parched and dry;
|  [19:6] Its branches shall dwindle and stink,
|    and the arms of the Nile shall be parched.
|  Reeds and rushes shall wither,
|    [19:7] The sedge on its brink shall shrivel;
|  and all that is sown by the Nile
|    shall be withered and whirled into nothing.

|  [19:8] The fishers mourn and lament,
|    that cast their hook in the Nile;
|  and all the spread their nets
|    on the face of the waters shall languish.

|  [19:9] The workers in flax shall be shamed,
|    the combers and weavers of white stuff;
|  [19:10] The weavers of cloth shall be crushed,
|    and the workers for hire shall be sorrowful.

|  [19:11] Sheer fools are the princes of Zoan;
|    the wisest of Pharaoh’s counsellors
|    prove but a witless council.
|  How then can you say unto Pharaoh,
|    ‟A son of the wise am I,
|    a son of ancient kings”?

|  [19:12] Where are your wise men, then?
|    Let them, pray, declare unto you,
|  and make known what the LORD  of Hosts
|    has purposed to do unto Egypt.

|  [19:13] Befooled are the princes of Zoan,
|    deceived are the princes of Memphis;
|  the chieftains of her tribes
|    have led Egypt all astray.

|  [19:14] The LORD  has mingled within them
|    the spirit of clouded judgment;
|  and so they led Egypt astray
|    in all her enterprise,
|    as a drunkard strays in his vomit.

|  [19:15] Thus head, tail, palm-branch and rush,
|    shall nothing accomplish for Egypt.

##### The Conversion of Egypt #####

[19:16] In that day shall Egypt fear and tremble like a woman, at the Hand which the LORD  of Hosts[19:17] will swing over her. The land of Judah shall be a terror to her; the very mention of the name shall fill her with dread at the thought of the purpose which the LORD  of Hosts has formed against her.

[19:18] In that day there shall be in the land of Egypt five cities speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing allegiance to the LORD  of Hosts; and one of them shall be called the City of the Sun.

[19:19] In that day there shall be an altar to the LORD  in the heart of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to[19:20] the LORD  at the border. It shall be a sign and a witness to the LORD  of Hosts in the land of Egypt: for when, under oppression, they cry to the LORD  to send a deliver, He will intervene and rescue[19:21] them. And the LORD  will reveal Himself to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall acknowledge the LORD  on that day: they shall worship Him with sacrifice and offering, they shall make vows to the LORD  and discharge them. the LORD  will smite[19:22] Egypt – smite and heal her: when they turn to the LORD, He will heal them in answer to their entreaty.

[19:23] In that day there shall be a highway between Egypt and Assyria; Assyrians will come to Egypt, And Egyptians to Assyria: Egyptians and Assyrians shall worship (the LORD ) in common.[19:24] In that day Israel will join Egypt and Assyria in a triple alliance, and so bring blessing to the world[19:25] around, which the LORD  of Hosts has in these words blessed: ‟Blessed be Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.”

#### Warning against the Folly of an Alliance with Egypt ####

 [Isaiah 20] 

[20:1] At that time Isaiah the son of Amoz received a message from the LORD, bidding him go and take the sackcloth from his loins and the sandals from his feet; and this he did, going about without[20:2] mantle of shoe. Then in the year that the Tartan, who had been despatched by Sargon King of Assyria,[20:3] came to Ashdod and took it by storm, the LORD  said, ‟Just as My servant Isaiah has gone for three years without mantle of shoe for a sign and a symbol to[20:4] Egypt and Ethiopia, so shall the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, be led away by the King of Assyria – without mantle or[20:5] shoe, and with buttocks exposed. Then those who had looked with hope to Ethiopia and made their boast of Egypt, shall be put to shame and dismay[20:6] And in that day the people who live in the coast-land shall say, ’If this be the fate of those to whom we had fled in expectation of help and deliverance from the King of Assyria, how can *we* escape?”

#### The Fall of Babylon ####

##### The Fall of Babylon: Its Consequences for Judah #####

 [Isaiah 21] 

[21:1] Oracle on the Wilderness

|  Like the roar of the whirlwind
|    that sweeps through the southland,
|  it comes from the desert,
|    that land of dread.
|  [21:2] A vision full stern
|    has been told unto me:
|  The robber still robs,
|    the spoiler still spoils.
|  ‟Go up, O Elam;
|    o Media, lay siege:
|  All the sighs of the crushed
|    have I brought to an end.”

|  [21:3] For this cause my loins
|    are filled with anguish;
|  with pangs am I seized
|    like a woman in travail.
|  I writhe with the message,
|    the vision confounds me.
|  [21:4] My mind goes a-wandering,
|    horror appals me;
|  the twilight I love
|    has been turned into trembling.
|  [21:5] The tables are ready,
|    the carpets are spread,
|    they are eating and drinking.
|  Arise, you princes,
|    spread oil on the shields.
|  [21:6] For on this wise the Lord
|    has spoken to me:
|  ‟Go, station a watchman
|    to tell what he sees.
|  [21:7] If he seethe a troop,
|    horsemen in pairs,
|  a train of asses,
|    a train of camels,
|  then let him give heed
|    with most diligent heed.”

|  [21:8] And the watchman cried,
|  ‟On the watch-tower, O Lord,
|    do I stand all the day;
|  at my post am I stationed
|    the live-long night.

|  [21:9] Lo! a troop I see coming,
|    of horsemen in pairs.”
|  And he uttered these words,
|    ‟Fallen, fallen is Babylon:
|  Down to the ground
|    fall her images shattered.”

|  [21:10] You my folk that were threshed
|    like the corn of the floor,
|  i have told you my message
|    from Israel’s God,
|    from the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The Fall of Babylon: Its Consequences for the Trading Tribes of the Desert! #####

[21:11] Oracle of Edom

|  One calls to me out of Seir,
|    ‟Watchman, how late in the night?
|    ‟Watchman, how late in the night?”
|  [21:12] The watchman made answer,
|  ‟The morning approached,
|    but still it is night.
|  If you would enquire,
|    come hither again.”

[21:13] Oracle ‟in the steppe”

|  In the bush, in the steppe, you must lodge for the night,
|    you caravans of Dedan.
|  [21:14] You dwellers in Temas’s land,
|  bring water to meet the thirsty,
|    and offer the fugitives bread.
|  [21:15] For before the sword they are fled,
|    before the whetted sword,
|  before the bow that is bent,
|    before the press of battle.

[21:16] For thus has the Lord said unto me, ‟Within a year, no more and no less, shall all the glory of[21:17] Kadar be at an end; and few shall remain of the mighty archers of the Kedareness. the LORD  the God of Israel has decreed it.”

#### Judah’s Unpardonable Sin ####

 [Isaiah 22] 

[22:1] Oracle on the Valley of Vision

|  What mean you that you are gone up,
|    one and all, to the house-tops,
|  [22:2] O town filled with uproar and tumult,
|    o City exultant?
|  Your slain are not slain with sword,
|    neither fallen in battle.
|  [22:3] Your chieftains are all fled together
|    that wielded the bow,
|  and your strong men are all taken prisoners,
|    though far they had fled.
|  [22:4] ‟Turn away from me,” therefore I say,
|    ‟Bitter tears would I shed.
|  Urge not upon me your comfort,
|    my people are ruined.”

|  [22:5] For a day of confusion and trampling and tumult,
|    doth come from the Lord, the LORD  of Hosts.
|  They tear down the wall in the Valley of Hanno,
|    the war-cry ascends to the mountains.
|  [22:6] Elam seized the quiver,
|    and Aram came riding on horses.
|  Kir uncovered the shield,
|    [22:7] Your choicest of valleys was crowded
|  with chariots and horsemen,
|    arrayed for assault on the gate.
|  [22:8] Then you looked to the arms in the House of the
|    forest,
|  [22:9] You had eyes for the gaps in the Fortress of
|    davis;
|  [22:11] But you looked not to Him that was doing all this,
|    you had no eyes for Him who had planned it of old.
|  [22:12] So the Lord, the LORD  of Hosts, has called you
|    to weeping and mourning, to baldness and sackcloth;
|  [22:13] But see! there is nothing but mirth and rejoicing,
|    slaying of oxen and killing of sheep,
|    eating of meat and drinking of wine –
|  Eating and drinking, ‟because” (as you say)
|    ‟We may haply be dead men to-morrow.”
|  [22:14] The LORD  of Hosts has declared in mine ear,
|    ‟This sin shall assuredly never be purged
|    till you die” – says the Lord, the LORD  of Hosts.

#### Personal Threats and Promises ####

##### The Doom of Sheba #####

|  [22:15] Against Shebna, the Governor of the Palace.
|  Thus says the Lord the LORD,
|    go, get you yonder perfect (and say),
|  [22:16] ‟What right have you here, and what kin have you here,
|    that you hew you here a sepulchre –
|  That here on the height you dost hew you a sepulchre,
|    carving a home for yourself on the rock?
|  [22:17] Behold, the LORD  will firmly enwrap you,
|    and wind you and wind you around and around:
|  [22:18] He will hurl you and hurl you afar like a ball,
|  mighty man that you are, to a spacious land.
|  Thither your glorious chariots shall follow,
|    and there shall you die,
|    you disgrace of the house of your lord.

##### The Exaltation of Eliakim #####

|  [22:19] I will thrust you from your office,
|    and tear you down from your post.
|  [22:20] That day will I summon My servant,
|    eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
|  [22:21] I will put your mantle upon him,
|    and give your authority into this hand.
|  And a father shall he be
|    to the folk of Jerusalem and the household of
|    judah.
|  [22:22] I will lay upon his shoulder
|    they key of the house of David,
|  so that none may shut when he opens,
|    nor open when he shuts.
|  [22:23] I will fasten him securely,
|    like a nail in a place that is firm.
|  Through him shall his father’s house
|    be lifted to seats of honour.”

##### The Downfall of Eliakim’s Family #####

[22:24] His family will hang upon him with all their weight – off-spring and off-scourings, all the meaner sort of vessels, be they bowls or be they pitchers.[22:25] In that day, says the LORD  of Hosts, shall the nail so firmly fastened be removed with a wrench, and down shall come in ruin all that had hung upon it: for the LORD  of Hosts has spoken it.

#### The fate of Phoenicia ####

##### The Elegy #####

 [Isaiah 23] 

[23:1] Oracle on Tyre.

|  Wail, you ships of Tarshish:
|    Your haven is ruined.
|  On your way from the island of Cyprus
|    the tale has been told you.
|  [23:2] The folk of the coast-land are perished,
|    the merchants of Sidon,
|  who traversed the sea, and whose envoys
|    did sail many waters,
|  [23:3] Whose harvest was wheat from the Nile,
|    and whose revenue trade with the nations.
|  [23:4] O Sidon, you Mother of Cities,
|    you Stronghold of Ocean,
|    in shame take up this lament:
|  ‟The youths that with anguish I bore and brought up
|    and the maidens I reared, are no more.”
|  [23:5] When tidings are come unto Egypt –
|    the tidings of Tyre –
|    in sore pain shall they be.

|  [23:6] Pass over to Tarshish, and wail,
|    you that dwell on the coast-land.
|  [23:7] Is this your jubilant city,
|    which dates from of old,
|  whose feet in the olden time bore her
|    to settle afar?
|  [23:8] Who then has purposed this doom
|    against Tyre, the crowned Queen,
|  whose merchants and traders were princes,
|    most honoured of earth?
|  [23:9] It’s the LORD  of Hosts that has planned it,
|    to desecrate pride,
|  to bring to contempt all splendour,
|    all pomp of the earth.

|  [23:10] Lament, you ships of Tarshish,
|    your haven is gone.
|  [23:11] He has stretched out His hand o’er the sea,
|    he has shaken the kingdoms.
|  The LORD  has charged touching Canaan
|    to ruin her fortresses.
|  [23:12] Exult no more, you are ruined,
|    o daughter of Sidon.
|  Arise, and pass over to Cyprus –
|    there, too, you shall rest not.
|  [23:14] Howl, you ships of Tarshish,
|    your haven is ruined.

##### The Revival of Tyre #####

[23:15] In that day Tyre shall pass into oblivion for seventy years, covering the period of one dynasty. At the end of seventy years, Tyre shall fare like the harlot in the song:

|  [23:16] With lyre in hand, walk up and down the city,
|    harlot, forgot by all:
|  Play skilfully, and sing them many ditty,
|    that they may you recall.

[23:17] But at the end of seventy years the LORD  shall visit Tyre (with favour). She will resume her meretricious practices, selling herself to all the kingdoms of the[23:18] world on the face of the earth. But her gains from this traffic shall be dedicated to the LORD : they shall not be stored or hoarded, but they are to belong to those who dwell in the LORD ’s presence; and these are to be furnished there from with abundance of food and stately apparel.

##### The Great World-Judgment #####

#### The Judgment: The Rebels Punished ####

 [Isaiah 24] 

|  [24:1] Hark! soon will the LORD  empty
|    and desolate the earth.
|  Her semblance He will distort,
|    her inhabitants He will scatter.
|  [24:2] Then the priest shall fare as the plain man,
|    the master shall fare as the servant,
|    the mistress as the maid.
|  The seller shall fare as the buyer,
|    the borrower shall fare as the lender,
|    the creditor as the debtor.
|  [24:3] The earth shall be utterly emptied,
|    the world shall be utterly spoiled,
|    for the LORD  has so decreed.

|  [24:4] The earth mourns and withers,
|    the world languishes and withers,
|    high heaven, like earth, languishes.
|  [24:5] The earth is all polluted
|    beneath the people that tread it;
|  for law they have transgressed,
|    and statue overstepped,
|    they have broken the eternal covenant.
|  [24:6] So a curse has devoured the earth,
|    it lights on her guilty people;
|  the people of earth are scorched,
|    and few are the men that are left.
|  [24:7a] The new wine mourns, the wine languishes,
|    [24:11b] And Over the land is an outcry for wine;
|  [24:7b] All merry hearts are sighing,
|    [24:8b] The tumult of gladness is silent,
|  [24:8a] Hushed us the mirth of the timbrel,
|    [24:8c] The mirth of the lute is hushed.
|  [24:9] No more is there drinking of wine with singing,
|    strong drink is bitter to those that drink it.
|  [24:10] The City of Chaos is shattered,
|    [24:11a] The houses are bolted and barred;
|  [24:11c] All merriment is over,
|    [24:11d] And gladness is vanished from earth.
|  [24:12] Desolation is left in the city,
|    the gates are battered to ruins.

|  [24:13] Few in the midst of the earth
|    shall be those that are left of the nations –
|  Few as the olives when beaten,
|    or grapes when the vintage is past.
|  [24:14] Yonder they lift their voices
|    in ringing shouts of joy;
|  to the glorious the LORD
|     They cry from over the sea.
|  [24:15] ‟Now then you folk of the east,
|    give glory to the LORD,
|  and you in the isles of the sea,
|    to the name of Israel’s God.”
|  [24:16] From the uttermost parts of the earth
|    there float to us songs of praise:
|  ‟Now glory has dawned for the righteous.”

|  ‟Ah misery, misery me,” said I,
|    ‟For the robbers are robbing and robbing still.”
|  [24:17] Trap, terror, and pit are before you,
|    all you that dwell on the earth.
|  [24:18] He that flies from the terror shall fall down the pit,
|    he that creeps from the pit shall be caught in the trap.
|  For the windows of heaven are opened,
|    and earth’s foundations tremble.
|  [24:19] The earth is breaking asunder,
|    the earth is splitting asunder,
|    the earth is shaking asunder,
|  [24:20] The earth like a drunkard is reeling,
|    she sways to and fro like a hammock;
|  so heavy a guilt lies upon her –
|    she falls, to rise no more.

|  [24:21] That day the LORD  shall punish
|  the host of high heaven in the height,
|    and the kings of the earth on the earth.
|  [24:22] And swept shall they be a dungeon, like prisoners,
|    and pent in the prison long time they shall lie,
|    till the day of their punishment dawns.
|  [24:23] Then the moon shall veil her face,
|    and the sun shall hide in shame;
|  for the LORD  of Hosts, enthroned
|    in Jerusalem on Mount Zion,
|  shall manifest His glory
|    in the presence of His elders.

#### The Banquet of the Nations on Mount Zion. ####

 [Isaiah 25] 

|  [25:6] On this mountain the LORD  of Hosts
|    shall prepare for all the nations
|  a feast of pieces fat,
|    a feast of wine on the less –
|  Fat pieces full of marrow,
|    and wine on the lees well strained.
|  [25:7] He shall rend on this mountain the veil
|    that enwrapped the face of all nations.
|  [25:8] He will swallow up death for ever.
|  And then will swallow up death for ever.
|  And then will the Lord the LORD
|     Wipe tears from every face,
|  and remove from off the earth
|    the reproach that has clung to His people.
|    The LORD  Himself has decreed it.

#### Israel’s Security in the Great World-Judgment ####

 [Isaiah 26] 

|  [26:20] O people of mine, come, enter your chambers,
|    and shut your doors behind you;
|  and hide you but for a moment,
|    till the wrath be overpast.
|  [26:21] For the LORD, behold! cometh forth from His place,
|    to punish the dwellers on earth for their guilt;
|  and the earth shall disclose her blood,
|    she shall cover her slain no more.

 [Isaiah 27] 

|  [27:1] When that cometh, the LORD  shall punish,
|    with His fierce and great and mighty sword,
|  leviathan the fleeing serpent,
|    and Leviathan the coiled serpent,
|    and the great sea-monster He will slay.
|  [27:12] That day will the LORD  beat out the grain
|    from the river Euphrates to the torrent of Egypt,
|  and *you* shall be gleaned, one by one, sons of Israel.
|  [27:13] That day, at the blast of a mighty trumpet,
|  the men that were lost in the land of Assyria,
|    and those that were outcast in Egypt’s land,
|  shall come and bow down to the LORD  in worship
|    on the holy Mount in Jerusalem.

#### Song of Thanksgiving over the Destruction of Some Proud City ####

 [Isaiah 25] 

|  [25:1] The LORD, You are my God;
|    I exalt You, I praise Your name:
|  For a marvellous thing You have done,
|    long purposed, now come to fulfilment.
|  [25:2] You have made of a city a heap,
|    of a fortified city a ruin;
|  the palace of pride is a city no more,
|    it shall not be rebuilt for ever.
|  [25:3] For this shall fierce nations own Your glory,
|    the city of tyrants shall fear You.
|  [25:4] For unto the weak You have proved You a stronghold,
|  a stronghold wast You to the poor in his straits –
|  A refuge from storm and a shadow from heat.
|  [25:5] You subdues the voice of the proud,
|    and you humblest the song of the tyrant.

#### Song over the Anticipated Destruction of Moab ####

|  [25:9] That day it shall be said:
|  Behold! this is our God,
|    for whom we have waited – to save us.
|  This is the LORD  for whom we have waited,
|    o let us rejoice and be glad – He has saved us.
|  [25:10] For here upon this mountain
|    the hand of the LORD  shall rest;
|  and Moab shall be trampled
|    in the place whereon he stands,
|    as straw in a dung-pit is trampled.
|  [25:11] Should he spread forth his hands.

#### Song of Gratitude and Hope ####

##### Jerusalem Secure: The Proud City Destroyed #####

 [Isaiah 26] 

|  [26:1] In that say shall this song be snug in the land of Judah:
|  A strong City is ours,
|    with bulwarks and walls
|    that He sets for our safety.
|  [26:2] Open the gates,
|    that the righteous may enter
|    who keeps the faith.
|  [26:3] The mind that is steady
|    you keeps in weal,
|    for it trusts in You.
|  [26:4] Trust in the LORD
|     Forevermore;
|  for Jah the LORD
|     Is Rock of Ages.
|  [26:5] For down He has cast
|    the dwellers on high,
|    the towering city,
|  abasing it even to the ground,
|    and laying it low in the dust.
|  [26:6] The foot shall trample it –
|    the feet of the poor,
|    and the steps of the needy.

##### It is Well with the Righteous, Ill with the Persistently Wicked #####

|  [26:7] The path of the upright is even,
|    you smoothest the way of the righteous.
|  [26:8] We have looked for You, O the LORD,
|    to come by Your pathway of judgment;
|  we have yearned for a sign of Your presence,
|    which men may remember for ever.
|  [26:9] I have yearned for You in the night,
|    yea, with passionate spirit have sought You.
|  When Your judgments come over the world,
|    those that dwell on the earth learn righteousness.
|  [26:10] No grace shall be shown to the wicked,
|    who righteousness will not learn,
|  but even in the land of truth
|    persist in their evil ways,
|  and are altogether blind
|    to the majesty of the LORD .

##### The Utter Destruction of the Enemy #####

|  [26:11] The LORD, Your hand is uplifted,
|    but they are blind thereto;
|    may they see it, and be ashamed.
|  Let the fire, reserved for Your foes,
|    and Your zeal for Your people consume them.
|  [26:12] O the LORD, establish our welfare;
|    for all that we have achieved
|    has been wrought for us by You.
|  [26:13] O the LORD  who are our God,
|    lords other than Thyself
|  have held us in their sway,
|  but *Your* name alone will we praise.
|  [26:14] The dead shall not live again,
|    the shades shall not arise;
|  you have visited them with destruction,
|    and blotted their memory clean.

##### A Yet More Glorious Day #####

|  [26:15] You have, O the LORD, increased the nation,
|    enlarged all the bounds of the land,
|    and shown Thyself most glorious.
|  [26:16] In our straits, O the LORD, we sought You;
|    we cried, because we were crushed,
|    your chastisement was upon us.
|  [26:17] As a woman that is with child,
|    when she draws nigh her time,
|    doth cry aloud in her pangs;
|  so were we, Lord, because of Your presence.
|    [26:18] For we, too, writhed in pangs,
|    but we brought forth nothing but wind.
|  We achieved for the land no deliverance;
|    the denizens of the world
|    fell not (in battle) before us.
|  [26:19] Your dead shall arise unto life,
|    they that dwell in the dust shall awake,
|    and utter cries of joy;
|  for a dew (from the regions) of light is Your dew,
|    and the earth (refreshed thereby)
|    Shall quicken the shades into life.

#### Song of the Vineyard ####

 [Isaiah 27] 

|  [27:2] In that day it shall be said:
|  Vineyard delightsome,
|    sing you of it.

|  [27:3] I am its guardian – the LORD  –
|    i water it moment by moment;
|  that no leaf of it shall fail,
|    by day and by night I guard it.
|  [27:4] I cherish no anger against it.
|    But had I the briers and thorns,
|  i would trample them down in the fray,
|    I would burn them up altogether.
|  [27:5] Else, then, let them seek My protection,
|    and let them make peace with Me;
|    yea, peace let them make with Me.

|  [27:6] That day shall Jacob take root,
|    israel shall blossom and bud,
|    and with fruit fill the face of the world.

#### the Lord’s Mercy to Israel ####

|  [27:7] Has (Israel) been smitten so sorely
|    as those that smote *her* have been smitten?
|  Or has she been slain without remnant,
|    as those that slew *her* have been slain?
|  [27:8] By dismissal and exile alone
|    doth (the LORD ) contend with *her*:
|  He has swept her away by His blast
|    that blows fierce in the day of sirocco.
|  [27:9] On this condition therefore
|    shall Israel’s guilt be forgiven –
|  When she puts away her sin
|    the issue thereof shall be this –
|  That all the stones of her altars
|    she shall grind, like chalk, to powder;
|  that sacred poles and sun-pillars
|    she never shall raise again.
|  [27:10] For the fortified city is desolate,
|    a homestead forsaken, forlorn,
|  like a pasture: there browses the calf –
|    there he lies, consuming the branches;
|  [27:11] And there, when the dry boughs are broken,
|    come women who use them for fuel.
|  For the people would not reflect;
|  and so from their Maker they win no pity,
|    no favour from their Creator.

##### Warnings and Promises to Jerusalem #####

#### Woe to Samaria ####

 [Isaiah 28] 

|  [28:1] Woe to the coronet proud of the drunkards of Ephraim!
|    Woe to the fading flower of her glorious beauty,
|    which crowns the heads of the men that are prostate with wine!
|  [28:2] See! the Lord has in readiness one that is mighty and strong –
|    like a storm of hail, or like tempest destructive,
|  like storm of a mighty tempestuous flood –
|    that will bring her with violence down to the ground.
|  [28:3] The coronet proud of the drunkards of Ephraim
|    shall be trampled under foot;
|  [28:4] And the fading flower of her glorious beauty,
|    which crowned the head of the fertile valley,
|  shall be as the first ripe fig before summer –
|  No sooner seen than swallowed,
|    the moment it is in the hand.

|  [28:5] But that day will the LORD  of Hosts
|    unto those that are left of His people
|    be Coronet lovely and Diadem fair –
|  [28:6] A spirit of justice to him
|    that presides over justice,
|  of valour to those at the gate
|    that stem the tide of war.

#### The Scoffers of Jerusalem Threatened ####

##### Isaiah’s Solemn Warning to the Drunken Priests and Prophets #####

|  [28:7] But here also men reel with wine
|    and stagger under drink;
|  yea, with drink reel prophet and priest,
|    with wine they are utterly dazed.
|  They reel in the hour of vision,
|    they totter in giving of judgment;
|  [28:8] All tables are full of vomit,
|    and filth is everywhere.

|  [28:9] ‟To whom does he mean to teach knowledge,
|    and impart his revelation?
|  To children weaned from the milk,
|    to babes just drawn from the breast –
|  [28:10] With his law upon law, law upon law,
|    saw upon saw, saw upon saw,
|    here a little and there a little?”

|  [28:11] (Well! thus I answer your mocking.)
|  Through barbarous lips and a foreign tongue
|    will (the LORD  now) speak to this people.
|  [28:12] For once had His message to you been this:
|  ‟The true rest in this – let the weary enjoy it:
|    And this is repose.” But you turned a deaf ear.
|  [28:13] So on this wise the LORD  will speak to you now:
|    ‟Law upon law, law upon law,
|  saw upon saw, saw upon saw,
|    here a little, and there a little” –
|  To the end that you trip on your way and fall backward,
|    shattered and snared and taken.

##### The Folly of the Egyptians Alliance #####

|  [28:14] Hear therefore the word of the LORD, you scoffers,
|    who rule this folk in Jerusalem.
|  [28:15] Because you have said, ‟We are leagued with Death,
|    and with Sheol we are compact;
|  so the flood, though it passes in whelming torrents,
|    shall never reach unto us;
|  for a lie we have made our refuge,
|    we have sheltered ourselves behind falsehood”:
|  [28:16] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD,
|    behold! I am laying in Zion a stone,
|  a tried and precious foundation stone,
|    and he that believeth shall not give way.
|  [28:17] And I will make justice the measuring-line,
|    and righteousness the plummet.
|  Then the refuge of lies shall swept by hail,
|    and the shelter deluged by water.
|  [28:18] Your league with Death shall be clean disannulled,
|    and your compact with Sheol shall no wise stand.
|  When the flood swept on, it will trample you down;
|    each time that it passes, ’twill bear you away.
|  [28:19] It shall pass every morning – by day and by night –
|    and the word, grasped at last, shall bring nothing but terror.
|  [28:20] For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out in,
|    the cover too narrow to wrap himself round.
|  [28:21] For the LORD  shall rise as He rose on mount Perazim,
|    blazing with wrath as in Gibeon’s vale,
|  to perform His task – that task so strange,
|    to accomplish His work – that work so.

|  [28:22] Now scoff you no more, lest your bands become tighter;
|    for this have I heard from the LORD  of Hosts –
|    a decree of destruction o’er all the earth.

#### The Patience and Considerateness of the Divine Purpose ####

|  [28:23] Listen, and hear you my voice;
|    attend and give ear to my speech.
|  [28:24] Doth the ploughman keep ploughing for ever,
|    keep opening and harrowing his ground?
|  [28:25] Doth he not, after levelling its surface,
|    scatter broadcast fennel and cummin,
|  and plant there wheat and barley,
|    and, for its border, spelt?
|  [28:26] The LORD  it is that has trained him aright,
|    and his God it is that has taught him.

|  [28:27] Men thresh not fennel with sledges,
|    nor are cart-wheels rolled over cummin;
|  but fennel is threshed with a staff,
|    and cummin with a flail.
|  [28:28] Do we ever crush bread-corn to pieces?
|    Nay, we do not keep threshing for ever;

#### The Character and Fate Jerusalem ####

##### The Fate of Jerusalem #####

 [Isaiah 29] 

|  [29:1] Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,
|    city where David encamped.
|  Let one or two years pass by,
|    a cycle of festivals more,
|  [29:2] and distress I will bring upon Ariel,
|    moaning and lamentation,
|  and you shall be Ariel indeed.
|  [29:3] I will camp, like David, against you,
|  and circle there round with entrenchments,
|    and set up forts against you.
|  [29:4] And low from the ground shall you speak,
|    and your words from the dust shall rise humbly
|  with voice like a ghost’s from the ground,
|    with twittering speech from the dust.
|  [29:5] But the horde of your foes shall become like fine dust,
|    and the horde of the tyrants like flying chaff.
|  Then swiftly and suddenly
|  [29:6] the LORD  of Hosts will visit you
|  with thunder and with earthquake,
|    and with din stupendous,
|  with whirlwind and with tempest,
|    and flame of devouring fire.
|  [29:7] But the horde of all the nations
|    that fight against Ariel,
|  with all their entrenchments and forts
|    and all the hosts that distress her,
|    shall be as a dream, as a vision of night.
|  [29:8] Like a man that is hungry, who dreams that he eats
|    and wakes to find his desire unappeased;
|  like a man that is thirsty, who dreams that he drinks,
|    and wakes all faint, with his thirst unquenched:
|  Even so shall it be with the horde of all nations
|    that fight against Mount Zion.

##### The Spiritual Torpor and Religious Formality of the People #####

|  [29:9] Utterly dazed shall you be,
|    utterly blind shall you be,
|  and drunken, though not with wine,
|    reeling, though not with strong drink.
|  [29:10] For the LORD  has poured upon you
|    a spirit of slumber deep;
|  the prophets, your eyes, He has sealed,
|    the seers, your heads, He has covered,
|  [29:11] so that the sight of all this is to you
|    as the words on a scroll that is sealed.

If put into the hands of a scholar with the request that he read it, he will reply, ‟I cannot, it is sealed.”[29:12] If, however, it be put into the hands of a man who is no scholar, with the request that he read it, he will reply, ‟I cannot, I am no scholar.”

|  [29:13] And the Lord said:
|  Because these people praise me with words,
|  honouring Me with their lips,
|    while their hearts are far away –
|  their religion only a mockery,
|    formulate learned by rote –
|  [29:14] I will deal with them therefore once more
|    in a fashion so wondrous strange
|  that their wise men’s wisdom shall perish,
|    their prudent men’s prudence shall vanish.
|  [29:15] Woe to them who conceal
|    from the LORD  their deep designs,
|  doing their deeds in the dark,
|    unseen, unperceived – so they think!

#### Doubters Rebuked by a Vision of Israel’s Welfare in the Latter Days ####

|  [29:16] O perverse that you are!
|    Is the potter no more than the clay?
|  Shall the thing that is made maintain
|    that it has not been made by its maker?
|  Shall the thing that is fashioned deny
|    that the potter has understanding?
|  [29:17] Soon Lebanon’s forests will become an orchard,
|    and orchards will be considered useless forest.
|  [29:18] In that day even the deaf
|    shall hear words read from a scroll,
|  and out of the gloom and darkness
|    the eyes of the blind shall see.
|  [29:19] And then shall the humble win
|    a new joy in the LORD,
|  and the poorest shall exult
|    in the Holy One of Israel.
|  [29:20] For the tyrant will have vanished,
|    and the scoffer will have ceased;
|  and those that were zealous in sin
|    shall all have been rooted out,
|  [29:21] With those that have falsely condemned,
|    and sought to entrap the judge,
|    and quibbled to injure the innocent.
|  [29:22] Thus therefore says the LORD,
|    the God of the household of Jacob,
|    Abraham’s redeemer:
|  No longer will Jacob be ashamed,
|    no longer will faces grow pale with embarrasment.
|  [29:23] For the moment he beholds his children,
|    what My hands have wrought in his midst,
|    they shall count My name as holy;
|  the Holy One of Jacob
|    they then shall count as holy,
|    and in awe hold the God of Israel.
|  [29:24] Those that had erred in spirit
|    shall then win understanding;
|  and those that had grumbled
|    will willingly learn the truth.

#### The Egyptian Alliance a Ruinous Policy ####

##### The Embassy to Egypt #####

 [Isaiah 30] 

|  [30:1] Ha! you refractory sons, says the LORD,
|    that follow a purpose I did not inspire,
|  and that make an alliance that *I* did not sanction,
|    thus heaping sin upon sin.
|  [30:2] They start on their journey to Egypt,
|    without consulting Me,
|  to flee to the shelter of Pharaoh shall turn to your shame,
|    and the shadow of Egypt shall prove your confusion.
|  [30:4] The princes encamp in Zoan,
|    the envoys arrive at Hanes,
|  [30:5] All of them laden with gifts
|    for a people that cannot avail them,
|  that brings no help or profit,
|    but only disgrace and shame.

|  [30:6] Oracle concerning the beasts of the South.
|    Through a land of distress and hardship,
|  of lioness and roaring lion,
|    of viper and flying dragon,
|  they carry their wealth on the backs of young asses,
|    their treasures on humps of camels,
|  to a people that cannot avail them,
|    whose help is vain and empty.
|  [30:7] And therefore I name her Rahab,
|    the monster brought to silence.

##### Judah’s Rebellion and Ruin #####

|  [30:8] Now go and write it down,
|    and on a roll inscribe it,
|  that it may be for the after-time,
|    a testimony for ever.
|  [30:9] For a rebel people are they,
|    sons that are utterly false,
|  sons that refuse to listen
|    to the teaching of the LORD  –
|  [30:10] That forbid the seers to see
|    and the prophets to prophesy truth.
|  ‟Speak to us smooth things,” they say,
|    ‟And prophesy illusions.
|  [30:11] Give over your wonted ways,
|    and leave your well-worn tracks;
|  and trouble us no more
|    with the Holy One of Israel.”

|  [30:12] This therefore is the message
|    of the Holy One of Israel:
|  ‟Because you reject this word,
|    and trust in guile and craft,
|    and lean your weight thereon,
|  [30:13] This guilt of yours shall be
|    like a rift in a lofty wall,
|    that bulges, ready to fall,
|  till suddenly and swiftly
|    down it comes with a crash –
|  [30:14] A crash like that of a pitcher
|    so ruthlessly dashed in pieces,
|  that not a shred can be found
|    among the scattered fragments
|  wherewith to take fire from the heart,
|    or to draw from the cistern water.”

|  [30:15] For thus says the Lord the LORD,
|    the Holy One of Israel,
|  ‟In calmly resting your safety lies,
|    in quiet trust shall be your strength.”
|  [30:16] But this you refused. You said ‟No;
|  but away we will speed upon horseback.”
|    Yes, speed indeed you shall.
|  ‟On steeds that are swift we will ride.”
|    Yes, and swift shall be they that pursue you.
|  [30:17] At the menace of five you shall flee,
|    until only a remnant be left,
|  like a pole on the top of a mountain,
|    or a signal upon a hill.

#### The Final Triumph and Prosperity of Jerusalem ####

##### Forgiveness and Prosperity #####

|  [30:18] Therefore the LORD  length
|    to show unto you His favour,
|  and therefore He arises
|    to reveal His pity upon you;
|  for the LORD  is God of justice:
|    Happy all who long for Him.
|  [30:19] For, O people of Zion that dwell in Jerusalem,
|    tears shall be yours no more.
|  He will show you His gracious favour;
|    at the (faintest) sound of your cry,
|    he will answer you, soon as He hears it.
|  [30:20] And though the Lord may give unto you
|    scant measure of bread and scarceness of water,
|  yet your Teacher no more shall withdraw,
|    but your eyes shall behold your Teacher.
|  [30:21] When you swerves to right of left,
|    you shall hear a voice behind you.
|  ‟This is the way: walk here.”
|  [30:22] And your images you shall defile –
|    whether carved and plated with silver,
|    or molten and covered with gold.
|  Like an unclean thing you shall scatter them,
|    saying to them, ‟Begone.”
|  [30:23] Rain shall He give for your seed,
|    wherewith you sow the ground;
|  and the wheat that springs from the ground
|    shall rich and abundant be.
|  In that day shall your cattle
|    graze over pastures broad.
|  [30:24] The oxen and asses that till the ground
|    shall feast upon salted provender,
|    that with shovel and fork has been winnowed.
|  [30:25] On every lofty mountain,
|    on every hill that is high,
|  shall be streams of running water,
|    on the day of vast slaughter and falling towers.
|  [30:26] And the moonlight shall be as the sunlight,
|    and the sun shall be sevenfold brighter than now,
|  in the day that the LORD  upbinds
|    the hurt of His people,
|    and heals the wound that has smitten them.

##### The Glorious Triumph #####

|  [30:27] Behold, the LORD  comes from afar
|    in thick rising clouds and with anger that blazes,
|  with lips that are filled with rage,
|    and tongue like devouring fire,
|  [30:28] With breadth like a rushing torrent,
|    that reaches even to the neck,
|  to sift till the nations are sifted to nothing,
|    to bridle their jaws and to lead them to ruin.

|  [30:29] Then a song you shall sing like the song
|    in the night of a holy festival;
|  and gladness of heart shall be yours,
|    as is his, who, to sound of flute,
|  sets forth for the Mount of the LORD,
|    to (worship) the Rock of Israel.
|  [30:30] The LORD  will utter His glorious voice,
|    he will bring down His arm in the sight of all,
|  in furious indignation,
|    and flame of devouring fire,
|    in cloud-burst and rain-storm and hailstones.
|  [30:31] At the thunder-voice of the LORD,
|    when He smiles with the rod,
|    shall Assyria be stricken with terror.
|  [30:32] And each stroke of the rod of destiny,
|    that the LORD  lays upon him,
|  shall fall to the music of timbrel and lute;
|    and with brandished arm shall He fight against them.
|  [30:33] For already a pyre is prepared,
|    constructed wide and deep,
|  piled high with blazing wood,
|    and fired by the breath of the LORD,
|    as by a stream of brimstone.

#### The Folly of the Egyptian Alliance ####

 [Isaiah 31] 

|  [31:1] Woe to those that journey
|    to the land of Egypt for help,
|  who rely on the throngs of her horses and chariots,
|    and trust in the eminent strength of her horsemen,
|  but never turn their eyes
|    to the Holy One of Israel,
|    and ask not the LORD  for counsel.
|  [31:2] Yet He too is wise, and He brings disaster;
|    his threats He has not recalled.
|  He will rise to contend with the household of miscreants,
|    and with those whom the wicked would summon to help them.
|  [31:3] The people of Egypt are men, not God;
|    and their horses are flesh, not spirit.
|  Let therefore the LORD  but stretch forth His hand,
|    and the helper will stumble, the holpen will fall,
|    and both shall perish together.
|  [31:4] For thus has the LORD  declared to me:
|  Like as a lion growls,
|    or a young lion over his prey,
|  when against him the shepherds are summoned
|    to come in all their strength –
|  At the shout he is undismayed,
|    at their noise he is nothing daunted –
|  So the LORD  of Hosts shall come down
|    to fight against Mount Zion,
|  and against the hill thereof;
|  [31:5] Then like fluttering birds (shall they flee).
|  Thus will the LORD  of Hosts
|    throw His shield around Jerusalem;
|  he will shield her and deliver her,
|    he will spare her and bring her to safety.

#### The Enemy’s Downfall ####

|  [31:6] O turn, you men of Israel, to Him
|    whom deeply you have offended.
|  [31:7] In that day each will disdain
|    the gold and silver idols
|    his guilty hands have made.
|  [31:8] Assyria shall fall by no mortal sword;
|    a sword, but not man’s, shall devour him.
|  From the face of that sword he shall flee,
|    and his youths shall be put to task-work.
|  [31:9] In his fear he will flee past his rocky retreat,
|    and his princes shall run from the standard in panic.
|  Thus says the LORD  whose fire is in Zion,
|    whose furnace is in Jerusalem.

#### Rulers and People in the Coming Days ####

 [Isaiah 32] 

|  [32:1] Behold there cometh a King
|    who shall rule in a spirit of justice,
|    and princes who govern with equity –
|  [32:2] Each like a shelter from the wind,
|    a refuge from storm of rain,
|  or like streamlets of water in dry parched places,
|    or shade of great rock in a weary land.

|  [32:3] Then the eyes that see shall not be sealed,
|    and the ears that hear shall not be heedless;
|  [32:4] The mind of the rash shall judge with discernment,
|    the stammering tongue shall be fluent and plain.
|  [32:5] No more shall a fool be called ‟noble,”
|    No more shall a knave be named ‟princely.”

|  [32:6] For the fool speaks folly for ever,
|    his mind evermore plots mischief;
|  his doings are profane,
|    and error he speaks of the LORD .
|  He leaves the hungry unsated,
|    and drink he withholds from the thirsty.
|  [32:7] The tricks of the evil are vile,
|    and villainies he plans –
|  To ruin the humble with lies,
|    and the poor, though his plea may be just.
|  [32:8] But the plans of the ‟noble” are noble,
|    by nobleness shall he endure.

#### Warning to the Women ####

|  [32:9] You women that are at ease,
|    arise and hear my voice;
|  you carelessly confident daughters,
|    give ear to what I say.
|  [32:10] In little more than a year
|    you shall shudder, for all your confidence;
|  for the vintage shall surely fail,
|    and the fruit shall not be garnered.
|  [32:11] Tremble, you women at ease,
|    and you that are confident, shudder;
|  strip you, and make you bare,
|    gird (sackcloth) upon your loins,
|  [32:12] And beat upon your breasts
|    in lament for the pleasant fields,
|    and for the fruitful vines,
|  [32:13] And for the land of my people,
|    overgrown with thorns and briers.
|  Not a house of mirth shall be left
|    in all the jubilant city.
|  [32:14] The palace shall be forsaken,
|    the thronging city deserted;
|  watchtower and hill shall become
|    an everlasting waste.

#### The Security and Prosperity of the Coming Days ####

|  [32:15] But yet from the heavenly height
|    shall a spirit be poured upon us,
|  and the desert become like a garden,
|    and the garden be counted a forest.
|  [32:16] Then justice shall dwell in the desert,
|    and righteousness live in the garden-land.
|  [32:17] Of justice the fruit shall be peace,
|    and the outcome of righteousness safety
|    and quietness for ever.
|  [32:18] My people shall dwell in the mansion of peace,
|    at the easeful rest in abodes secure.
|  [32:19] The forest shall be felled,
|    and the city laid utterly low.
|  [32:20] Happy are you that may sow
|    in a land that is all well watered,
|    where oxen and asses may roam.

#### The Present Distress and the Future Glory of Jerusalem ####

##### The Distress #####

 [Isaiah 33] 

|  [33:1] Woe to you, spoiler, whom none has despoiled;
|    you treacherous robber, whom no one has robbed.
|  When your spoiling is over, you too shall be spoiled;
|    when your robbing is ended, you too shall be robbed.

|  [33:2] O the LORD, be gracious to us,
|    we have waited for You;
|  be You our Arm every morning,
|    our Saviour in time of distress.

|  [33:3] At the sound od the tumult the peoples are fled;
|    you lift Yourself, and the nations are scattered.
|  [33:4] (Your folk), like the locusts, shall gather the booty,
|    over it swarming, as grasshoppers swarm.

|  [33:5] The Lord is exalted, He dwells on high;
|    with justice and righteousness Zion He fills,
|  [33:6] With wealth of salvation and wisdom and knowledge,
|    with treasure that flows the fear of the LORD .

|  [33:7] The heroes of Ariel are crying without,
|    the envoys of peace shed bitter tears;
|  [33:8] Forlorn are the highways, the wayfarer ceases.
|  He has broken the compact and mocked at its witnesses,
|    utterly reckless of human kind.
|  [33:9] The earth mourns and languishes,
|    lebanon withers in shame:
|  Sharon is now like a desert,
|    and Bashan and Carmel are leafless.

##### The Deliverance #####

|  [33:10] But thus says the LORD, ‟Now *I* will arise;
|    yea now, even now, I will lift Me on high.
|  [33:11] You are pregnant with chaff, and your child shall be stubble,
|    my breath shall devour you like fire.

|  [33:12] The nations shall sink through the burning ashes,
|    like a thorns cut away, that are kindled with fire.
|  [33:13] The men of far countries shall hear of My doings,
|    and those that are near shall acknowledge My might.”

|  [33:14] The sinners in Zion are filled with terror,
|    and shuddering seizes the souls profane.
|  ‟O who can dwell with devouring fire?
|    Who cab dwell with eternal flame?”

|  [33:15] Who walks in righteousness, speaks with honesty,
|    scorns the gain that is won by oppression;
|  whose hand refuses to clutch at a bribe,
|    who stops his ears at a tale of blood,
|  who closes his eyes at the sight of evil:
|    [33:16] He it is that shall dwell on impregnable heights.
|  On a fastness of rock shall his stronghold be,
|    where his bread is provided, his water is sure.
|  [33:17] Thine eyes shall behold the King in His beauty,
|    they shall look on the land that stretches afar.
|  [33:18] And thus shall you muse on the (vanished) terror:
|    ‟Where is he that once weighed, that once counted the tribute,
|    and he that once counted the towers (for assault)?”
|  [33:19] No more shall you look on the insolent people,
|  the people of dark and difficult speech,
|    who chatter a barbarous, meaningless tongue.

|  [33:20] Look on the city of Zion,
|    the home of our festal assemblies;
|  thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem,
|    as a home of ease, a tent unremoved,
|  whose pegs shall never be plucked from the ground,
|    and not one of whose cords shall be snapped asunder.

|  [33:21] In place of broad encompassing streams
|    shall be there for our comfort the LORD ’s own river,
|  a river where sails no fleet with oars,
|    and stately galleys pass not over.

|  [33:22] For the LORD  Himself is our Judge,
|    the LORD  Himself is our Marshall,
|  the LORD  Himself is our King:
|    It is He, He alone, that shall save us.

|  [33:23d] Then shall the blind divide spoil in abundance,
|    [33:23e] And then shall rich plunder be seized by the lame.
|  [33:24] Nevermore shall inhabitants say, ‟I am sick,”
|    For the sins of her people are all forgiven.

##### The Golden Age #####

#### The Day of Vengeance ####

##### The Destruction of the Nations #####

 [Isaiah 34] 

|  [34:1] Draw nigh, you nations, and hearken;
|    you peoples, give attention.
|  Let the earth and its fullness hearken,
|    the world and all its offspring.

|  [34:2] For the LORD  is wroth with all nations,
|    and angry with all their host;
|  he has doomed them to destruction,
|    has given them up to slaughter.

|  [34:3] Their slain shall be flung out,
|    and a stench shall arise from their corpses;
|  the mountains shall run with their blood,

|  [34:4] The heavens shall roll up like a scroll,
|    and all their host shall fade –
|  As the leaves fade away from the vine,
|    as the foliage fades from the fig-tree.

##### The Destruction of Edom #####

|  [34:5] For already drunk with His wrath
|    is the sword of the LORD  in heaven.
|  See! down it descends upon Edom
|    in doom on that people accursed.

|  [34:6] Blood-gorged is the sword of the LORD
|     It is smeared all over with fat
|  with the blood of lambs and of goats,
|    with the fat of the kidneys of rams.

|  For the LORD  has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
|    vast slaughter in Edom’s land:
|  [34:7] With those shall be struck down wild oxen,
|    and bullocks together with steers.

|  Their land shall be drunken with blood,
|    and their dust shall be smeared with fat;
|  [34:8] For the LORD  has set Him a day of revenge,
|    and the Champion of Zion a year of requital.

|  [34:9] Her streams shall be turned into pitch,
|    and the dust of the land into brimstone;
|  her land shall be turned into pitch,
|    that burns night and day.

|  [34:10] It shall not be quenched for ever,
|    her smoke shall go up through the ages;
|  a waste she shall lie evermore,
|    to be crossed by no traveller for ever –

|  [34:11] The haunt of the pelican and bittern,
|    the home of the owl and the raven:
|  The LORD  will stretch out upon her
|    the measuring-line of Chaos,
|    and the plums of Destruction.

|  [34:12] Satyrs shall dwell therein,
|    her nobles shall cease to be;
|  no kingdom shall there be proclaimed,
|    and her princes shall be no more.

|  [34:13] Where her palaces were, shall spring thorns;
|    in her fortresses, nettles and thistles.
|  A haunt shall she be for jackals,
|    a place for the camping of ostriches.

|  [34:14] wild cats shall join the hyenas,
|    and satyrs shall meet with their fellows;
|  there only the night-hag reposes,
|    and finds her place of rest.

|  [34:15] There the arrow-snake nestles and lays,
|    there she broods and hatches her eggs;
|  there only the vultures gather –
|    not one without its mate.

|  [34:16] Search in the Book of the LORD  –
|    not one of all these is missing;
|  for the LORD ’s own lips have commanded,
|    and His is the breath that has gathered them.

|  [34:17] *He* has assigned it by lot to them,
|    his is the hand that apportioned it,
|  as their everlasting possession,
|    their home through all the ages.

#### The Joy of the Redeemed ####

 [Isaiah 35] 

|  [35:1] Let the desert and parched land rejoice,
|    let the steppe-land exult and burst forth;
|  let it burst into bloom like narcissus,
|    and ring with glad cries of rejoicing,

|  [35:2] All dowered with the glory of Lebanon,
|    the splendour of Carmel and Sharon:
|  They shall witness the LORD ’s own glory,
|    the majesty of our God.

|  [35:3] Strengthen the hands that hang down,
|    and the tottering knees make firm;
|  [35:4] Tell you the wild-beating hearts
|    to be strong and unafraid.
|  Behold! your God is coming,
|    he will surely avenge His people;
|  god is coming in retribution,
|    he Himself is coming to save you.

|  [35:5] Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
|    the ears of the deaf unstopped;
|  [35:6] Then the lame shall leap like a hart
|    and the tongue of the dumb shall sing.

|  For waters break out in the desert,
|    and torrents in the wilderness;
|  [35:7] The parched land becomes a pool,
|    and the thirsty land springs of water.

|  In the haunts of (wild cats and of) jackals
|    (Your flocks and your herds) shall rest,
|  and the court (where the ostriches camp)
|    Shall be filled with reeds and rushes.

|  [35:8] And there a pure highway shall rise,
|    to be called ‟The Holy Way”;
|  the unclean shall not pass over it,
|    fools shall not wander therein.

|  [35:9] No lion shall be there,
|    no ravenous beast shall ascend it;
|  but there shall the ransomed walk,
|    yea, the LORD ’s redeemed shall come home.

|  [35:10] They shall come unto Zion with singing;
|    and crowned with unending joy;
|  for at last joy and gladness have found them,
|    and sorrow and sighing are fled.

##### Historical Appendix #####

#### Isaiah Encourages Hezekiah to Resist Sennacheirb’s Summons to Surrender Jerusalem ####

##### First Narrative #####

 [Isaiah 36] 

[36:1] In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, after having assaulted and captured all the fortified cities of Judah,[36:2] despatched his Chief Officer from Lachish with a large force against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. Near the conduit of the upper pool, where he had taken up his position on the Fuller’s Field Road,[36:5] he was visited by a deputation consisting of Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder.

[36:4] The Chief Officer began: ‟This is the message from the Great King, the King of Assyria: I desire[36:5] you to deliver it to Hezekiah. ’What sort of confidence is this that you cherish? Do you imagine that in war a mere word of the lips is the equivalent of wisdom and strength? Now who is it you are[36:6] trusting in, that you presume to rebel against me? Of course you are trusting to Egypt, that staff of broken reed, which will enter and piece the hand of the man that leans upon it: that is all that Pharaoh King of Egypt will prove to those who[36:7] trust to him. If, however, you tell me you are trusting to your God the LORD, why, that is the very god whose sanctuaries and altars Hezekiah has abolished, commanding the people of Judah and Jerusalem to confine their worship to the altar at this[36:8] place? Now, make a wager, if you like, with my lord the King of Assyria: I am prepared to furnish you with two thousand horses, if you on your part[36:9] can supply them with riders. (But if you cannot), how do you propose to repel the onset of one of the least of my lord’s officers? yet you trust to Egypt[36:10] for chariots and horsemen. And now do you imagine that I have not the LORD ’s sanction for invading this land with a view to its destruction? Why, it is the LORD  Himself who commissioned me to invade this land and destroy it.’”

[36:11] Thereupon Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked the Chief Officer to be good enough not to speak to them in Hebrew, in the hearing of the people on the wall, but in Aramaic, which they assured him[36:12] they understood. ‟Nay,” replied the Officer, ‟it is not to your lord and yourself that my lord has sent me with this message, but precisely to the men on the wall, whom your policy is likely to reduce to eating their own filth and drinking their own water. ”

[36:13] Then the Chief Officer came forward and cried aloud in Hebrew, ‟Listen to the words of the[36:14] Great King, the King of Assyria. Thus says the King: Do not let yourselves be imposed upon by[36:15] Hezekiah, for he is powerless to deliver you; and do not let yourselves be induced to trust to the LORD  by Hezekiah’s assurances that the LORD  will unquestionably save you, and that this city will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria.[36:16] Give no heed to Hezekiah; for thus says the King of Assyria to you, Make your peace with me and surrender, and then everyone shall eat of his own vine and fig-tree, and drink water from his own[36:17] cistern, till I come and take you to a land like your own – a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and[36:18] vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you with assurances that the LORD  will save you. Has the god of any nation ever rescued his land from the grasp[36:19] of the King of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods Sepharvain? And where are the gods of the land of Samaria? Have they rescued Samaria from[36:20] his grasp? Which of all these national gods has succeeded in rescuing his land from my grasp, that the LORD  should now rescue Jerusalem from my[36:21] grasp?” To this they answered not a word, they remained silent; for the King had expressly told[36:22] them not to answer him. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder, tore their garments, and returned to Hezekiah, telling him what the Chief Officer had said.

 [Isaiah 37] 

[37:1] When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went[37:2] into the Temple; and he despatched Eliakim, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth,[37:3] to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, to whom they spoke as follows: ‟A message from Hezekiah! This is a day of trouble, chastisement, and disgrace: for children are come to the birth,[37:4] and there is not strength to bear them. But it may be that the LORD  your God will hear the words of the Chief Officer, whom the King of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will punish the word which the LORD  your God has heard: so lift up[37:5,6] your prayer for those that remain.” And this was the answer that Isaiah returned to the deputation of King Hezekiah’s ministers: ‟Tell your master,” he said, ‟that the LORD ’s message to him is this: he is not to be afraid of the blasphemous words he has heard from the minions of the King of Assyria.[37:7] ’ Behold,’ says He, ’I will inspire him with such a spirit (of panic) that on the strength of a rumour he will return to this own land, and there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall a victim to the sword.’”

[37:8] Then the Chief Officer returned and found the King of Assyria engaged in the siege of Libnah, for he had heard that he had moved his camp from Lachish.[37:9a] When the news reached him that Tirhakah King of Ethiopia was advancing to give him battle …

So Sennacherib, King of Assyria, broke up camp and returned to Nineveh, where he settled. Subsequently, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch his god, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer. They, however, made good their escape to Armenia, and he was succeeded by Esar-haddon his son.

##### Second Narrative #####

|  [37:9b] Then he sent messengers to Hezekiah with the[37:10] following instructions. ‟This,” said he, ‟is what you are to say to Hezekiah King of Judah,[37:11] Do not let the god you trust in delude you with his assurance that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. You are well aware of the ruin the King of Assyria has brought upon all lands, and are *you* to escape?[37:12] Were the nations which my father destroyed saved by their gods – Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the[37:13] Edenites in Telassar? Where is the King of Hamath and the King of Arpad and the King of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?”

[37:14] Hezekiah received the letter at the hands of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the[37:15] Temple and spread it before the LORD, and to[37:16] the LORD  thus he prayed: ‟O the LORD  of Hosts, You God is Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, You are God alone over all the kingdoms of the earth: You are the Creator of heaven and earth.[37:17] Incline Thine ear, O the LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O the LORD, and see; and hear the message of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult[37:18] the living God. True it is, O the LORD, that the Kings of Assyria have devoted all nations and[37:19] their lands to destruction, and thrust their gods in the fire, for no gods were they at all, but wood and stone, fashioned by human hands and so they were[37:20] destroyed. But now, O the LORD  our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O the LORD, are God.”[37:21] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent this answer back to Hezekiah: ‟Thus says the LORD  the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib, King of Assyria.[37:22] This is the word of the LORD  concerning him:

|  The virgin, the daughter of Zion,
|    contemns you and mocks you;
|  behind you Jerusalem’s daughter
|    is shaking her head.
|  [37:23] Against whom have you lifted your voice
|    in reviling and blasphemy?
|  Yea, your eyes you have lifted to heaven
|    against Israel’s Holy One.
|  [37:24] You have reviled, by your minions,
|    the Lord, and have said,
|  ‟With my chariots I climb the high hills,
|    the recesses of Lebanon;
|  her towering cedars I fell,
|    and her cypresses choice;
|  and I pierce to her furthest retreat,
|    where the forest is thickest.
|  [37:25] Wells, too, (in the desert) I dig,
|    and I drink of strange waters;
|  with the sole of my foot I dry up
|    all the Nile-streams of Egypt.”
|  [37:26] Hast you not heard that all this
|    I prepared long ago?
|  From the old I had planned it, and now
|    I have brought it to pass:
|  So ’tis your to lay fortified cities
|    in desolate heaps.
|  [37:27] Their inhabitants, impotent all,
|    are dismayed and confounded,
|  become like the grass of the field,
|    like the green tender grass;
|  they are like unto grass on the roofs
|    that the east wind has blasted.
|  [37:28] Your sitting and rising I know,
|    and your going and coming;
|  [37:29] Your raging and uproar against Me
|    are come to Mine ears.
|  So My ring I will put through your nose
|    and My bit in your lips,
|  and (thus led) I will make you return
|    by the way that you came.
|  [37:30] And the sign unto you shall be this:
|  This year you shall eat that which grows of itself,
|    and the next that which springs therefrom;
|  but the third you shall sow and reap,
|    plant vineyards and eat of their fruit.
|  [37:31] And those that escape of the household of Judah
|    shall again take root downward, and upward bear fruit;
|  [37:32] For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant,
|    and forth from Mount Zion all such as escape.
|  The zeal of the LORD  of Hosts
|    shall bring this thing to pass.

|  [37:33] Therefore thus says the LORD  concerning the King of Assyria,
|  he shall not come into this city,
|    nor shoot an arrow there;
|  he shall not come before it with shield,
|    nor cast up a mound against it.
|  [37:34] But back he shall go by the way that he came,
|    and into this city he shall not enter;
|  [37:35] For I will protect and deliver this city,
|    for Mine own sake and David My servant’s sake.

[37:36] Then the angel of the LORD  went forth and slew in the camp of Assyria one hundred and eighty-five thousand men: when they rose in the morning, behold! every man was a lifeless corpse.

#### Hezekiah’s Sickness, Recovery, and Song of Thanksgiving ####

##### Hezekiah’s Sickness #####

 [Isaiah 38] 

[38:1] In those days Hezekiah was seized with a mortal sickness: and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said, ‟the LORD  commands you to set your household affairs in order; for you will[38:2] not recover, you are to die.” Then, turning his face to the wall, Hezekiah offered this prayer to[38:3] the LORD : ‟Remember, O the LORD, I beseech You, how I have lived in Your presence with a faithful and undivided heart, and done the thing that pleased You.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Then[38:4] there came to Isaiah this message from the LORD,[38:5] ‟Go and say to Hezekiah: This says the LORD, the God of David your father, ’I will add to your life fifteen[38:6] years more. You and this city together I will rescue from the grasp of the King of Assyria, and[38:21] this city I will protect.’” Then Isaiah said, ‟Let them take a cake of figs and press it on the boil, to[38:22] ensure his recovery.” And Hezekiah said, ‟What is the sign that I shall yet go up to the Temple?”[38:7] ‟Take this,” he replied, ‟as a sign from the LORD[38:8]  that He will do what He has promised. Watch the shadow that the descending sun has cast on the step-clock of Ahaz: I will bring that shadow ten steps backward.” and the sun did indeed go back on the step-clock the ten steps it had gone down.

##### Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving #####

[38:9] A psalm of Hezekiah King of Judah, to celebrate his recovery from the sickness which had overtaken him:

|  [38:10] Me thought I was doomed to depart
|    when my life was at noon-tide –
|  Consigned to the portals of Sheol
|    the rest of my years.
|  [38:11] I had thought to see Jah nevermore
|    in the land of the living,
|  and never again to behold
|    any man in this world.

|  [38:12] Like the tent of a shepherd, my home
|    is plucked up and stripped from me;
|  he has rolled up my life like a web,
|    from the thrum He has cut me.
|  To pain I am doomed night and day,
|  [38:13] And I cry till the morning,
|  while all my bones, like a lion
|    he crushes in pieces.

|  [38:14] I scream as screams a swift,
|    like a dove do I moan;
|  mine eyes look tearfully heavenward:
|    O think on me, Lord, be my surety.
|  [38:15] What can I utter or say,
|    since ’tis He has done it.
|  I toss all the time of my slumber –
|    my soul is so bitter.
|  [38:16] O rest You my spirit, refresh me,
|    and let me recover.
|  [38:17] "Tis You that have kept my soul
|    from the pit of destruction.
|  Behind Your back You have cast
|    mine iniquities all.

|  [38:18] For Sheol can give You no thanks,
|    nor can Death sing Your praises;
|  and they that go down to the pit
|    cannot hope for Your love.
|  [38:19] It is the living, the living, that praise You,
|    as I do this day.
|  So the father shall tell to his sons
|    of Your faithfulness sure.

|  [38:20] Be pleased, O the LORD, to save us:
|    Then all the days of our life
|  we shall play upon instruments stringed
|    in front of the house of the LORD .

#### Hezekiah’s Vanity and Isaiah’s Rebuke ####

 [Isaiah 39] 

[39:1] At that time, Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, King of Babylon, having heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered, despatched[39:2] eunuchs to him with a present. Hezekiah, delighted, proceeded to display to them his treasure- house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, the armoury, and the whole range of his treasures: there was nothing in his place or indeed in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

[39:3] Then came the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah and said, ‟Where do these men come from, and what have they said?” ‟They have come,” said Hezekiah, ‟from a distant land, from Babylon.”[39:4] ‟What have they seen in your palace?” said Isaiah; and Hezekiah answered, ‟Everything: there is none of my treasures that I have not shown them.”[39:5] ‟Listen, then,” said Isaiah, ‟to the word of the LORD[39:6]  of Hosts. Mark, the day is coming, when all that is in your palace, and all the treasures that you ancestors have hither to amassed, shall be carried to[39:7] Babylon: nothing shall be left, says the LORD . And of the sons that may yet be born to you, some shall be taken to become eunuchs is the palace of the[39:8] King of Babylon.” Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, ‟I accept the word of the LORD  which you have spoken.” At least, thought he, there will be peace and stability in my day.

|  [40:5] Then the LORD  shall show forth His glory,
|    and all fresh shall see it together:

|  ‟Proclaim that all flesh is grass,

|  [40:9] Get you up to a mountain high,
|    you that tallest good tidings to Zion;
|  lift up your voice with strength,
|    you that brings good news to Jerusalem;
|    lift it up, be not afraid.
|  Say to the cities of Judah,
|    ‟Yonder cometh your God.”

|  [40:10] See! the LORD  is coming in might,
|    with an arm that ensures His dominion.
|  Behold, His reward is with Him,
|    his recompense is before Him.
|  [40:11] He feeds His flock like a shepherd,

#### The Sovereignty and Omnipotence of God as Seen in Nature ####

|  [40:12] Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?
|    Who has ruled off the heavens with a span,
|  comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure,
|  and weighed the mountains in scales,
|    and the hills in a balance?

|  [40:13] Who has directed the mind ‟ ”of the LORD ?
|    And where is the counsellor that taught Him?
|  [40:14] Whom did He ask for enlightenment?
|  Who taught Him the pathway of right,
|    or showed Him the way of true insight?

|  [40:15] See! nations are nought but a drop on a bucket,
|    they count but as dust on a balance;
|  he lifted the isles like a mote.
|  [40:16] Too small for the fires (of His altars) is Lebanon,
|    too few are its breasts for an offering.

|  [40:17] All nations are nothing before Him,
|    he counts them but empty nothing.
|  [40:18] So to whom will you liken God,
|    or what likeness set over against Him?
|  [40:19] An imagine! A craftsman has cast it,

 [Isaiah 41] 

|    A goldsmith o’erlaid it with gold.
|  [41:6] Each workman helps his fellow,
|    and says to his neighbour, ‟Set to.”
|  [41:7] So the craftsman heartens the goldsmith,
|    the polisher says to the finisher,
|  ‟Fine piece of soldering that!”

 [Isaiah 40] 

|    Then the nails down the statue securely.
|  [40:20] And he would carve a wood image
|    makes choice of a wood that decays not;
|  then he seeks a craftsman of skill,
|    to erect for him an image,
|    that is warranted not to topple.

|  [40:21] But know you not then of yourselves, or from hearsay?
|    Has this from the first not been told you?
|  Of this have you not been aware,
|    since the day that the world was founded?
|  [40:22] It is He that sits throned on the vault of the earth,
|    so high that the dwellers thereon are like locusts;
|  that stretches the heavens across like a veil,
|    and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
|  [40:23] It is He that reduces proud princes to nothing,
|    that turns the rulers of earth into nothing.
|  [40:24] Scarce are they planted, and scarce are they sown,
|    and scarce has their stock then root in the earth,
|  when He blows upon them, and so they wither:
|    The whirlwind bears them away like chaff.

|  [40:25] To whom will you liken Me, then?
|    And who is My match? says the Holy One.
|  [40:26] Lift up your eyes on high;
|    see! who has created all those?
|  He who brings their host out by number,
|    and summons each by his name:
|  So great His resource and so mighty His power
|    that not one of them fails to answer.

|  [40:27] Why say you, then, O Jacob,
|    and Israel, why maintain
|  that your lot is unknown to the LORD,

|  [40:28] Know you not of yourself or by hearsay –

|  Or announce what is yet to come,
|    that we may mark the issue;
|  [41:23] Declare what shall be hereafter,
|    and then we shall know you are gods.
|  Yea, do aught that you please, good or ill,
|    that may strike us with awe to behold.

|  [41:24] Now see, you are nothing, and nought can you do:
|    Hateful is he that chooses you.

##### No Heathen God, but the  #####

LORD  Alone, Predicted the Advent of Cyrus

|  [41:25] I have roused up one from the north, he is come –
|    even one from the sunrise who calls on My name;
|  he shall trample on princes like mortar,
|    as potter tramples the clay.

|  [41:26] Bur who from the first has announced this,
|    that so we might recognize it?
|  Or who has aforetime declared it,
|    that now we must own to its truth?
|  There was none that announced or declared it,
|    not one heard a word from *you*.

|  [41:27] It was I who first told it to Zion,
|    and gave the glad news to Jerusalem.

|  [41:28] I looked all around – there was no one;
|    not one of the gods could give counsel
|    or answer, to taught that I asked them.

|  [41:29] See! one and all they are nothing,
|    and nothing can they do:
|    Their idols are wind and waste.

##### The Servant (Israel), his Task and Destiny #####

#### The Servant’s Task ####

 [Isaiah 42] 

|  [42:1] Behold!
|  My Servant, whom I uphold;
|    my Chosen, the joy of My soul.
|  I have put My spirit upon him;
|    he shall publish (My) Law to the nations.

|  [42:2] He shall not cry, nor shout,
|    nor utter his voice in the streets;
|  [42:3] Not a reed that is bent shall he break,
|    nor a wick that burns dim shall he quench.

|  He shall faithfully set forth (My) Law,
|  [42:4] All erect and aglow shall he be:
|  He shall yet set (My) Law in the earth,
|    and the islands shall wait for his teaching.

|  [42:5] Thus says the LORD, the God
|    who spread out and stretched forth the heavens;
|  who created the earth and its fruits,
|    giving breath to the people upon it,
|    and spirit to them that tread it:
|  [42:6] With full and deliberate purpose
|    have I the LORD  called you,
|    and taken your hand in Mine;
|  I formed you as pledge and symbol
|    of My covenant with mankind –
|  A light to enlighten the nations,
|    [42:7] To open the eyes of the blind,
|  and to bring from the dungeon the captives
|    who sit in the darkness of prison.

|  [42:8] I am the (true) God, the LORD ;
|    this is the name that is Mine:
|  And My glory I yield to no other,
|    my praise shall no image enjoy.
|  [42:9] Behold, the predictions of old are fulfilled,
|    and new things I now declare;
|  before they spring into being,
|    I make them know unto you.

#### The New Song ####

|  [42:10] Sing a new song to the LORD,
|    his praise form the end of the earth;
|  let the sea and its fullness roar,
|    the islands and those that dwell there.
|  [42:11] Let the desert rejoice with her cities,
|    the villages Kedar inhabits;
|  let Sela’s inhabitants sing,
|    let them shout from the top of the mountains.
|  [42:12] Let them give to the LORD  glory,
|    and tell forth His praise in the islands.
|  [42:13] The LORD  goes forth like a hero,
|    he stirs His rage like a warrior;
|  he shouts His fierce battle-cry,
|    he engages His foes like a hero.

#### The Lord at last Bestirs Himself ####

|  [42:14] Long time have I held My peace,
|    and restrained Myself in silence;
|  but now, like a woman in travail,
|    I groan, I pant and gasp.
|  [42:15] Mountains and hills I will waste,
|    I will dry up all their herbage;
|  the streams I will turn into sand,
|    and the pools I will clean dry up.
|  [42:16] The blind I will lead and guide,
|    by ways and by paths unfamiliar;
|  their gloom I will turn into light,
|    and the ground that is rough I will level
|  these are the things I will do,
|    they shall not be left undone.
|  [42:17] But those that put trust in an idol,
|    and call an image their god,
|    shall backward be driven in shame.

#### A Call for Repentance on Israel’s Part ####

|  [42:18] Hearken. you that are deaf;
|    and you blind, look up, that you see;
|  [42:19] Who is blind but My Servant,
|    and who is deaf as My Messenger?
|  Who is blind as Mine Envoy,
|    and the deaf as the LORD ’s Servant?
|  [42:20] Much have you seen that you marked not;
|    your ears, though open, were dead.
|  [42:21] The LORD  was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake,
|    to make His instruction great and glorious.
|  [42:22] Yet it is still a people
|    plundered and despoiled,
|  all of them snared in dungeons,
|    and hidden away in prisons –
|  A prey without prospect of rescue,
|    a spoil of which none says ‟Restore.”
|  [42:23] Which of you now will give ear unto this,
|    will attend and hear for the time to come?
|  [42:24] Who gave up Jacob to plunderers,
|    and Israel to them that despoiled him,
|  [42:25] And poured His hot anger upon him,
|    in fury of war so intense
|  that it blazed round about him – he knew not why –
|    and it burned him, yet never heart did he lay it?

#### The Lord will show His Love for Israel by Gathering her Exiles Home ####

 [Isaiah 43] 

|  [43:1] But now – thus says the LORD,
|    your Creator, O Jacob, your Maker, O Israel –
|  Fear not, for I have redeemed you,
|    and called you by name: you are Mine.
|  [43:2] When you pass through waters, then I will be with you;
|    no rivers shall bear you away in their flood:
|  When you walk through fire, you shall no wise be scorched,
|    and the flames shall not kindle upon you.

|  [43:3] For I am the LORD  your God,
|    your Deliverer, Israel’s Holy One;
|  egypt I give as your ransom,
|    yea, Seba and Cush in your stead
|  [43:4] Because in My sight you are precious,
|    both honoured and beloved,
|  those lands I will give as your ransom,
|    those peoples in your stead.
|  [43:5] Therefore fear not, for I am with you.

|  I will bring your seed from the sunrise,
|    and gather you out of the sunset;
|  [43:6] I will say to the north, ‟Give them up;”
|    And unto the south, ‟Withhold them not.”
|  Bring in My sons from afar,
|    and My daughters from the ends of the earth –
|  [43:7] Every one that is called by My name,
|    whom I fashioned and made for My glory.

#### Israel is the  ####
LORD ’s Witness to the World
|  [43:8] Forth! you folk that have eyes, but are blind;
|    and you that have ears, yet are deaf.
|  [43:9] The nations are all assembled,
|    the peoples are gathered together.
|  Which of them all can declare such a thing,
|    or announce to us such in advance?
|  Let them prove themselves right by the witness they bring,
|    who shall say, when they hear, ‟It is true.”

|  [43:10] But *you* are My Witnesses – thus says the LORD  –
|    my Servants, whom I have chosen,
|  that they may acknowledge and trust Me,
|    and learn I am ever the same.
|  No god was formed before Me,
|    and after Me shall be none.
|  [43:11] I, even I, am the LORD,
|    and Saviour beside Me is none.

|  [43:12] It was I, and no strange god among you,
|    who announced and declared and delivered.
|  You are My witnesses – thus says the LORD  –
|    and I am God from of old,
|  [43:13] From henceforth ever the same.
|  There is none that can snatch from My hand,
|    and who can reverse what I do?

#### The Deliverance from Babylon more Wonderful than the Deliverance from Egypt ####

|  [43:14] Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
|    the Holy One of Israel:
|  For your sake I send unto Babylon,
|    and down will I bring them in flight.
|  I will lay the Chaldeans low,
|    and turn their rejoicing to mourning;
|  [43:15] For I am the LORD, your Holy One,
|    the Creator of Israel, your King.

|  [43:16] Thus says the LORD,
|  who of old made a way through the Sea,
|    and a path through the mighty waters;
|  [43:17] Who chariot and horse led forth,
|    the warriors and war-host together –
|  They lay down, but they rose no more,
|    they were quenched and put out like a wick –
|  [43:18] Think of those old things no more,
|    nor give heed to those deeds of the old time.
|  [43:19] For see! I am doing a new thing,
|  already it springs to view:
|    Do you not recognize it?

|  Yea, a path I will make through the desert,
|    and rivers in the wilderness;
|  [43:20] The wild beasts shall render Me honour,
|    the jackals and the ostriches.
|  For with water I dower the desert,
|    the wilderness with streams,
|  to yield drink to My chosen people,
|  [43:21] The people I formed for Myself,
|  to tell abroad My praise.

#### Israel’s Restoration is Due, not to her own Merits, but to the Lord’s Free Grace ####

|  [43:22] Yet you have not called upon Me, O Jacob,
|    nor wearied yourself about Me, O Israel.
|  [43:23] You have not brought unto Me
|    burnt offerings of sheep,
|    nor did honour Me with your sacrifice.

|  I burdened you not with offerings,
|    nor wearied you with frankincense;
|  [43:24] You brought Me no sweet cane with your money,
|    you sated Me not with the fat of your sacrifice.
|  But you by your sins have burdened Me,
|    and through your transgressions have wearied Me.
|  [43:25] Yet I, even I, am He
|    that blots out your transgressions;
|    your sins I remember no more.
|  [43:26] Call to My mind your merits,
|    let us urge our several pleas;
|  reckon up all that you canst,
|    to prove yourself in the right.
|  [43:27] Thine ancient sire was a sinner,
|    your prophets were rebels against Me,
|  [43:28] My Temple your princess profaned;
|  so Jacob I gave to destruction,
|    and Israel to reviling.

 [Isaiah 44] 

|  [44:1] Yet hear now, Jacob My Servant,
|    and Israel, whom I have chosen;
|  [44:2] Thus says the LORD  your Maker,
|    who formed you and helped you from birth:
|  Fear not, Jacob My Servant;
|    jeshurun, whom I have chosen:
|  [44:3] For water I will pour on the thirsty,
|    and rills on the ground that is dry,

|  On your sons I will pour out My spirit,
|    my blessing upon their offspring:
|  [44:4] And then shall they grow like the grass among waters,
|    like willows by water-courses.
|  [44:5] And one shall declare, ‟I belong to the LORD ;”
|    Another shall call himself Jacob:
|  Another shall write on his hand, ‟To the LORD,”
|    And add to his own name the surname of Israel.

#### Israel’s God is Sovereign and Eternal ####

|  [44:6] Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel,
|    his Redeemer, the LORD  of Hosts:
|  I am the First, I too am the Last,
|    beside Me is no god at all.
|  [44:7] Who is like Me? Let him stand and proclaim
|    and declare it and set it in order before Me?
|  Who has announced from of old things to come?
|    Let them tell us the things that shall yet come to pass.
|  [44:8] Be not disquieted, be not afraid:
|    Have not I from the old time proclaimed and declared it?
|  You are my Witnesses: is there a God
|    or a Rock beside Me at all?

#### The Folly of Idolatry ####

|  [44:9] Makers of idols are all an illusion,
|    and profitless all are the idols they dote on;
|  no vision or insight have whose adore them,
|    and so in the end they shall come but to shame.
|  [44:10] (The fool who believes) he has fashioned a god,
|    has but fashioned a profitless metal image.
|  [44:11] The magical arts are all put to shame,
|    the words of enchantment are only human.
|  The worshippers all, when they stand assembled,
|    shall tremble and come to confusion together.

|  [44:12] The smiths prepare it over the coals,
|    and into the shape that is fitting he hammers it,
|    working it up with his sturdy arm.
|  Then hunger comes over him – feeble he grows,
|    or faint, if so be that he drinks no water.
|  [44:13] The carpenter stretches his measuring-line,
|    with s stylus he traces the shape of the image,
|  and carves it with tools human likeness,
|    a fair human likeness, to rest in a chapel.

|  [44:14] Forth a man goes to cut himself timber;
|    from the forest he chooses a plane or an oak,
|  which the Lord did plant, and the rain has nourished
|    for men to make use of as fuel for kindling.
|  [44:15] He sets it ablaze and he warms himself,
|    or he kindles a fire, and bakes bread;
|  or he makes it into a god and bows down to it,
|    fashions an image and falls down before it.
|  [44:16] One half of the wood in the fire he burns,
|    then he roasts flesh on the embers therefrom;
|  whereafter he eats the roast to his fill,
|    then he warms himself, and he says, ‟Ha! ha!
|    Now I am warm, I feel the glow.”
|  [44:17] The rest of it then he makes into a god –
|    to an image, and bows down prostate before it.
|  He prays to it, and his prayer is this:
|    ‟Deliver you me, for you are my god.”

|  [44:18] No insight has he, and no power of discernment,
|    his eyes are besmeared, that he cannot see,
|    and his mind is sealed past understanding.
|  [44:19] He suffers never his thoughts to ponder,
|    he has not the sense or the insight to say,
|  ‟One half thereof in the fire I have burned,
|    and bread I have baked on the embers therefrom;
|  flesh I have roasted and eaten: and then
|    of the rest shall I make a detestable image,
|    and bow myself down to a block of wood?”

|  [44:20] Who takes delight in combustible idols
|    is led far astray by delusion of heart:
|  He cannot deliver himself, and confess
|    that his hand has been grasping an utter delusion.

#### Let the World Rejoice over Israel’s Redemption ####

|  [44:21] Remember these things, O Jacob;
|    yea, Israel, for you are My Servant.
|  I made you, My Servant are you;
|    o Israel, you must not renounce Me.
|  [44:22] I blot out your sins as a mist,
|    as a thick dark cloud your transgressions;
|    return unto Me, for I have redeemed you.
|  [44:23] Rejoice, O you heavens, for the LORD  has wrought it;
|    and shout, O you depths of the earth.
|  Break forth into jubilant cries, you mountains;
|    you forest, and the trees therein.
|  For the LORD  has now wrought redemption for Jacob,
|    he shows His glory in Israel.

##### Cyrus and the Overthrow of Babylon #####

#### The Lord Calls Cyrus and Bestows upon Him a Career of Victory, for Israel and the World’s Sake ####

|  [44:24] Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
|    who formed you from the womb:
|  I am the LORD, Creator of all things,
|    that stretched forth the heavens alone,
|    and spread out the earth by Myself;
|  [44:25] That frustrates the omens of soothsayers,
|    making diviners like fools,
|  thrusting the wise to the background,
|    and turning their science to folly;

|  [44:26] But the words that *My* servants have spoken I confirm,
|    and the purpose My messengers urge I fulfil.
|  For I say to Jerusalem, ‟You shall be peopled,
|    [44:28c] The Temple foundations shall yet be laid:
|  [44:26] The cities of Judah shall yet be rebuilt,
|    and the ruins thereof I will raise again.”
|  [44:27] I will say to the deep, ‟Be dry;
|    for all your floods I will wither.”
|  [44:28a] Cyrus I name as My friend,
|    he shall execute all My purpose.

 [Isaiah 45] 

|  [45:1] thus says the (true) God, the LORD,
|    to Cyrus His Anointed,
|  whose hand I hold in Mine,
|    to bring down nations before him,
|  to open doors before him,
|    and gates – to be closed no more:
|  [45:2] ‟I will go in person before you,
|    and mountains I will level;
|  I will shiver the doors of bronze,
|    and cleave bars of iron in sunder.

|  [45:3] I will give you the dark-hidden treasures,
|    in secret places hoarded,
|  that so you may learn that I am the LORD,
|    the God of Israel, who called you by name.
|  [45:4] For the sake of Jacob My Servant,
|    and Israel My Chosen,
|  i called you by your name:
|    Though you knew Me not, I rejoiced in you.
|  [45:5] I am the LORD, and there is no other;
|    beside Me is no god at all.

|  [45:1e] The loins of kings I ungird;
|    [45:5c] But you will I gird, though you knew Me not;
|  [45:6] That men from the sunrise and sunset
|    may know there is none beside Me.
|  I am the LORD, and there us no other,
|    [45:7] The Maker of light, the Creator of darkness,
|  the Maker of weal, the Creator of woe:
|    It is I, the LORD, that doeth all this.”
|  [45:8] You heavens, pour down your showers,
|    let victory rain from the skies.
|  Let the earth open (her womb)
|    And bring forth the fruit of deliverance.
|  Let victory blossom therein:
|    It is all My creation, the LORD ’s creation.

#### Murmurs against Cyrus Rebuked ####

|  [45:9] Woe unto him that strives with his Maker –
|    a potsherd no better than earthen potsherd.
|  Doth the clay say to the potter,
|    ‟What thing is this that you make?”
|  Doth the vessel he wrought exclaim,
|    ‟What a handless person you are!”
|  [45:10] Woe to the son who says,
|    ‟Sirem what is this you beget?”
|  Or ‟Mother, what bring you forth?”

|  [45:11] Thus says the (true) God, the LORD,
|    israel’s Maker and Holy One:
|  Would you ask Me of things to come,
|    or command Me as touching My handiwork?
|  [45:12] It was I – the Maker of earth,
|    the Creator of man upon it,
|  whose hands stretched out the heavens,
|    and on all their host laid charge –
|  [45:13] It was I who of purpose aroused him,
|    and all his ways I smooth:
|  He it is that shall build My city,
|    and set Mine exiles free;
|  yet neither for price nor reward.
|    Thus says the LORD  of Hosts.

#### The Heathen Acknowledge the Uniqueness of Israel and Her God ####

|  [45:14] Thus says the LORD  of Hosts:
|  The peasants of Egypt, the merchants of Cush,
|    and the giant men of Seba,
|  shall pass in procession as lieges before you,
|    and walk behind you in chains.
|  They shall bow to you prostrate, and thus they
|    shall pray to you:
|  ‟God is with you alone,
|    there is no other god at all:
|  [45:15] Yea, truly with you God hides Himself;
|    yea, Israel’s God is a Saviour.”

|  [45:16] Ashamed and confounded together
|    are all who have risen up against Him –
|    the idol-making craftsmen.
|  [45:17] But Israel is saved by the LORD
|     With salvation everlasting:
|  You shall not be ashamed or confounded
|    for ever and evermore.

#### The Lord Desires the Salvation of the Whole World ####

|  [45:18] For thus says the LORD, God indeed,
|    creator of the heavens,
|  who made the earth and fashioned it,
|    and also fixed it fast,
|  creating it not for a desert,
|    but fashioning it for man’s home:
|  ‟I am the LORD, and there is none other.

|  [45:19] Not in secret spake I,
|    nor in any land of darkness;
|  the offspring of Jacob I asked not
|    to go in vain quest of Me.
|  I am the LORD, My words are true,
|    and straight are My proclamations.

|  [45:20] Come, you that survive of the nations,
|    assemble, draw near together.
|  No shred of sense have they
|    that carry an image of wood,
|  and make their prayers to a god
|    who is impotent to save.

|  [45:21] Declare and bring forward (your case),
|    yea, let them take counsel together:
|  Who has announced this old,
|    or declared it in days gone by?
|  Is it not I, the LORD ?
|    There is no other god beside Me –
|  A righteous God, and a Saviour,
|    and none there is beside Me.

|  [45:22] Look unto Me and saved,
|    all you ends of the earth;
|  for I am God, and there is no other.
|  [45:23] By Mine own self have I sworn
|  that to Me every knee shall bow,
|    every tongue shall swear allegiance,
|  [45:24] And own that the LORD  alone
|    is the Giver of strength and of victory.”
|  All that were furious against Him
|    shall come unto Him with shame;
|  [45:25] But all the descendants of Israel
|    shall triumph and boast in the LORD,

#### The Downfall of Babylon’s Gods ####

 [Isaiah 46] 

|  [46:1] Bel bows down, Nebo stoops:
|    Consigned are their idols to beasts –
|    on weary beasts lifted and laden.
|  [46:2] They crouch, they are bowed down together;
|    unable to rescue their load,
|    they themselves are gone into captivity.

|  [46:3] Hearken to Me, house of Jacob,
|    you of Israel’s house that remain,
|  all you that from birth have been carried
|    and upheld since the day you were born.
|  [46:4] Till old age I am ever the same;
|    till your hair is grey, I will carry you.
|  It is I that have borne the burden,
|    it is I that will carry it still;
|    it is I that will carry and save you.
|  [46:5] To whom will you liken or equal Me?
|    Whom will you set as My peer?

|  [46:6] They that freely give gold from a purse
|    and that weigh in a balance the silver,
|  hire a goldsmith to fashion a god of it;
|    then they fall down and worship it.
|  [46:7] They carry the load on their shoulder,
|    and set it down on its base,
|    where it stands, in its place, unmoved.
|  It answers no man’s cry,
|    it saves no man in his trouble.
|  [46:8] Reflect, then, and own yourselves guilty;
|    you rebels, lay it to heart.
|  [46:9] Remember the things of long ago;
|    for I am God, and there is none like Me.
|  [46:10] From the first I declare the issue,
|    from ancient times things yet to be done;
|  I declare that My purpose shall stand,
|    I will execute all My pleasure.
|  [46:11] I have called a wild bird from the sunrise,
|    the man of My purpose from a far distant land.
|  I will usher in what I promised,
|    and accomplish the thing that I planned.

|  [46:12] Hearken to Me, you faint-hearted,
|    who deem that your triumph is far away;
|  [46:13] The triumph I bring you is near, not far,
|    my deliverance shall not tarry.
|  I will set the deliverance in Zion,
|    and lavish My glory on Israel.

#### The Downfall of Babylon ####

 [Isaiah 47] 

|  [47:1] Come down, and sit in the dust,
|    o virgin daughter of Babylon;
|  sit on the ground unthroned,
|    o daughter of the Chaldeans:
|  For you shall be called no more
|    the Tender and the Dainty.
|  [47:2] Take mill-stones, and grind the meal;
|    and put your veil aside.
|  Strip off your skirt, and pass
|    bare-legged through the rivers.
|  [47:3] Let your nakedness be uncovered,
|    and let your shame be seen.
|  For vengeance I will take,
|    irrevocable vengeance –
|  [47:4] Thus says our Redeemer,
|    the LORD  of Hosts is His name,
|    the Holy One of Israel.

|  [47:5] Sit in silence and shrouded in darkness,
|    o daughter of the Chaldeans;
|  for you shall be called no more
|    the Mistress of Dominions.
|  [47:6] True, I was wroth with My people,
|    my heritage I profaned;
|  and I gave them into your hand,
|    but you showed no pity upon them;
|  you laid upon the aged
|    thine exceeding heavy yoke.
|  [47:7] You said, ‟I shall live for ever,
|    and be Mistress evermore;”
|  These things you did lay not heart,
|    nor did think how it all would end.

|  [47:8] Hear this now, Lady of pleasure,
|    who sits so securely,
|  and says in your heart,
|    ‟It is I, there is none beside me;
|  I shall never sit as a widow,
|    nor know the loss of children.”
|  [47:9] These two things shall come upon you,
|    full swift in a single day –
|  The loss of your husband and children
|    shall suddenly come upon you,
|  despite your many spells,
|    despite your enchantments many,
|  [47:10] Despite your trust in your wickedness,
|    and your fancy that no one can see you.

|  Behold your wisdom and knowledge –
|    ’Tis they that have led you astray;
|  and you in your heart did say,
|  ‟It is I, there is none beside me.”
|  [47:11] So disaster shall come upon you,
|    which no knowledge of your can avert;
|  destruction shall fall upon you,
|    which you have no power to appease;
|  sudden ruin shall come upon you,
|    which you have no knowledge (to banish).
|  [47:12] Abide, then, by your enchantments,
|    abide by your sorceries many,
|    wherein you have toiled from your youth.
|  Perchance you may somewhat avail,
|    perchance you may yet strike terror.

|  [47:13] You have wearied yourself with your counsellors;
|    now let them stand up and save you –
|  Those men that divide up the heavens,
|    directing their gaze to the stars,
|  and month by month make known
|    what things are coming upon you.
|  [47:14] But see! they are all like stubble,
|    the fire burns them up.
|  Not even themselves can they save
|    from the mighty power of the flame: –
|  It is no glowing coal to warm at,
|    no fire to sit before.
|  [47:15] Such then have they proved unto you,
|    in whose cause you have toiled from your youth;
|  your flee staggering, each his own way –
|    not a man of them all to save you.

#### The Summons to Depart from Babylon ####

##### The New Prophecies will be Fulfilled as Surely as the Old #####

 [Isaiah 48] 

|  [48:1] Hear this, O household of Jacob,
|  called by the name of Israel,
|    and sprung from the loins of Judah,
|  that swear by the name of the LORD,
|    and celebrate Israel’s God –
|    but neither with justice or truth;
|  [48:2] For they call themselves after the Holy City,
|    and lean on the God of Israel,
|    whose name is the LORD  of Hosts.

|  [48:3] Of old I announced predictions,
|    and uttered them forth from My lips:
|    Of a sudden I wrought, and they came.
|  [48:4] But I knew that you wast stubborn,
|    with a neck like an iron band,
|    and a forehead all of brass;
|  [48:5] So I told it you long ago:
|    Ere it came to pass, I informed you:
|  In case you should claim that your idol had wrought it,
|    thine images – molten or graven – appointed it.
|  [48:6] You have heard it, now see it fulfilled;
|    wilt you not bear witness to it?

##### The Restoration of Israel and the Future Glory of Zion #####

#### The Servant Discouraged, but at last Triumphant ####

##### The Servant: His Seeming Failure and his Great Destiny #####

 [Isaiah 46] 

|  [46:1] Hearken, you isles, unto me,
|    and you peoples from far, give attention.
|  The LORD  has called me from birth,
|    from the womb of my mother He gave me my name.

|  [46:2] Like a sharp sword made He my mouth,
|    in the shadow of His hand did He hide me;
|  he made me a polished shaft,
|    in His quiver He concealed me.

|  [46:3] And He said to me, ‟You are My Servant,
|    in whom I will show My glory;”
|  [46:5e] And so I had honour in the sight of the LORD,
|    [46:5f] My God became my strength.

|  [46:4] But I said, ‟I have laboured in vain,
|    I have spent my strength on an empty nothing;
|  yet safe is my cause with the LORD,
|    and my recompense with my God.”

|  [46:5a] And now – thus says the LORD,
|    who formed me from birth for His Servant,
|  to bring Jacob back unto Him,
|    and that Israel to Him might be gathered –
|  [46:6] He says, ‟It is too light a thing”
|    To raise up the tribes of Jacob,
|    and Israel’s dispersed to restore:
|  I will make you a light to the nations,<footnote>7</footnote
|    that so My salvation may reach
|    to the very ends of the earth.”

##### Israel’s Happy Return and Restoration #####

|  [46:7] Thus says the (true) God the LORD,
|    israel’s Holy Redeemer,
|  to him who of men is contemned,
|    abhorred of the nations, the servant of tyrants:
|  Kings, when they see you, shall rise,
|    and princes shall bow down in homage,
|  because of the LORD  the Faithful,
|    and Israel’s Holy One, who chose you.

|  [46:8] Thus says the LORD :
|  Now will I favour and answer you,
|    now will I help and deliver you;
|  making you pledge and symbol
|    of my covenant with mankind:
|  Restoring the (ruined) land,
|    and allotting the desolate heritage;
|  [46:9] Bidding the prisoners go forth,
|    and the inmates of darkness to show themselves.

|  They shall pasture wherever they go,
|    even on all the bare hills shall be pasture;
|  [46:10] They shall neither hunger nor thirst,
|    neither sun nor the hot wind shall smite them.
|  For One that pitiesshall lead them,
|    and guide them to foundations of water.
|  [46:11] I will make all the mountains a highway,
|    and roads shall be raised everywhere.
|  [46:12] Lo! yonder they come from afar,
|    some from the north and the west,
|    and some from the land of Syene.

|  [46:13] Sing, O you heavens, for joy;
|    and earth, do you exult;
|    let the mountains break forth into song.
|  For the LORD  comforts His folk,
|    takes pity upon His affected.

#### The Consolation of Zion ####

##### Wasted Zion will be Rebuilt and Repeopled #####

|  [46:14] ‟But the LORD,” says Zion, ‟has left me;”
|    My Lord has forgotten me clean.”
|  [46:15] Can a woman forget her babe,
|    cease to pity the son of her womb?
|  Yes, such may indeed forget,
|    but never will I forget you.
|  [46:16] I have graven you on My hands,
|    and your walls are for ever before Me:
|  [46:17] In haste men are coming to build you;
|    while those that have torn you down
|    and laid you in ruins, shall leave you.

|  [46:18] Lift up your eyes round about, and behold
|    how they flock to you, all of them gathered together.
|  Yea, thus says the LORD  on oath, as I live,
|    you shall wear them upon you as jewels on a garment,
|    and bind them about you as bride binds her girdle.
|  [46:19] For your desolate wastes and your ruined land
|    (Shall be turned to a garden and crowded with men.)
|  Then scarce room enough shall you have for your people,
|    when those that devoured you are far away.

|  [46:20] The children you long wast bereft of
|    shall one day declare in your ears,
|  ‟This place is too narrow for me,
|    give me ampler space to dwell in.”
|  [46:21] And then shall you say in your heart,
|  ‟Who can have borne me these children?
|  Since I am bereaved and unfruitful,
|    who can have reared these children?
|  Behold! I was left all alone:
|    Who then can these children be?”

#### Three Words of Consolation ####

##### At a Signal from the  #####

LORD, the Nations shall Bring Israel Back to Zion

|  [46:22] Thus says the Lord the LORD :
|  Behold I will lift up My hand to the nations,
|    and raise for the people My banner(as signal);
|  and then shall they bring your sons in their bosom,
|    and carry your daughters upon their shoulders.
|  [46:23] Kings shall be your foster-fathers,
|    and queens shall be your nursing mothers;
|  with face to the earth they shall do you homage,
|    and lick the dust of your feet:
|  And then you shall know that I am the LORD,
|    who never will bring those who trust Me to shame.

##### the Lord is Omnipotent #####

|  [46:24] Can prey from the mighty be wrenched,
|    or can captives escape from a tyrant?
|  [46:25] Verily, thus says the LORD :
|  Yes, even from the mighty can captives be wrenched,
|    and the prey of a tyrant escape;
|  but *I* will defend your cause,
|    *I* will deliver your children,
|  [46:26] And cause your oppressors to eat their own flesh,
|    and to drink themselves drunk with their blood as with wine.
|  And then all flesh shall know
|    that I am your Saviour-Redeemer,
|    the LORD, the Strong One of Jacob.

##### the Lord’s Omnipotent Love #####

 [Isaiah 50] 

|  [50:1] Thus says the LORD :
|  Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement,
|    wherewith I have put her away?
|  Or which of My creditors is it
|    to whom I have ever sold you?
|  If sold you have been, ’tis because of your sins;
|    your rebellions have led to your mother’s divorce.

|  [50:2] Why, when I came, was there no one,
|    and none to respond when I called?
|  Is my hand too short to deliver?
|    And have I no power to rescue?
|  With a word of a rebuke did I dry up the sea,
|    and rivers I turned into desert;
|  their fish dried up for lack of water,
|    their monsters perished on thirsty land.
|  [50:3] I clothed the heavens in mourning,
|    and sackcloth I made their covering.

#### The Servant Tried but Trusting ####

|  [50:4] The Lord the LORD  has given me
|    the tongue of a true disciple,
|  to know how to answer the weary
|    with words (of consolation).

|  In the morning He wakens mine ear
|    to listen, as true disciple;
|  [50:5] As for me, I have not been rebellious,
|    or turned me backward away.

|  [50:6] I gave my back to the lash,
|    and my cheeks unto those that plucked them;
|  my face and I did not hide
|    from insult or from spitting.

|  [50:7] For the Lord of the LORD  helps me,
|    and so I am not confounded;
|  I set my face like a flint,
|    and I know I shall never be shamed.

|  [50:8] My Vindicator is nigh,
|    who then dare to contend with me?
|    Let us both stand up together.
|  Who dare be mine opponent?
|    Let him draw nigh unto me.

|  [50:9] See, the LORD  the Lord is my helper;
|    where, then, is the man that can worst me?
|  They all like a garment shall crumble,
|    the moth shall eat them up.
|  [50:10] Let that man among you that fears the LORD
|     Give ear to the voice of His Servant.
|  Whoso walks in darkness,
|    with not a gleam of light,
|  let him trust in the name of the LORD,
|    and lean upon his God.

|  [50:11] All you that kindle a fire,
|    and you that set brands aflame,
|  begone to the flame of your fire,
|    get you into the brands you have lighted.
|  This is your fate at My hand,
|    that you lie in the place of torment.

#### Words of Encouragement and Promise ####

##### Deliverance is Near and Sure #####

 [Isaiah 51] 

|  [51:1] Hearken to me, you that yearn for redress,
|    that seel for the aid of the LORD ;
|  look to the rock from which you were hewn,
|    to the quarry from which you were dug.
|  [51:2] Look unto Abraham your father,
|    and Sarah-her who bore you:
|  For he was but one, when I called him,
|    yet I blessed him and increased him.

|  [51:3] So the LORD  has comforted Zion,
|    has comforted all her ruins,
|  her desert has made like the LORD ’s own garden,
|    like Eden itself her wilderness.
|  Therein shall joy and gladness be found,
|    giving of thanks and the sound of melody.
|  [51:4] Give heed unto Me, My people,
|    o nation of Mine, give ear;
|  for from Me shall direction go forth,
|  even My law to enlighten the nations.
|  [51:5] I will bring My deliverance swiftly;
|    my victory is now on the way,
|    mine Arms shall judge the peoples.
|  For Me do the islands wait,
|    they shall set their hope in My Arm.

|  [51:6] Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
|    and look on the earth beneath;
|  for the heavens shall vanish like smoke,
|    and the earth like a garment (shall perish;
|  the world) shall crumble to pieces,
|    her people shall die like gnats:
|  But eternal shall be My salvation,
|    my triumph shall not fail.

|  [51:7] Hearken to Me, you that care for the right,
|    you folk in whose heart is My teaching;
|  be not afraid of the insults of men,
|    let no their reviling dismay you:
|  [51:8] For even as a garment the moth shall consume them,
|    the worm shall consume them like wool;
|  but eternal shall be My salvation,
|    my triumph from age to age.

##### Appeal to the Lord to Show His Ancient Power #####

|  [51:9] Awake, O Arm of the LORD,
|    awake, and clothe you with might;
|  awake as in days of old,
|    as in ancient generations.
|  Art *you* not the Arm that hewed Rahab in pieces,
|    and pierced the dragon through?
|  [51:10] Art *you* not the Arm that once dried up the sea,
|    the waters of mighty ocean,
|  that made the depths of the sea
|    a way for the ransomed to pass?

|  [51:12] I, I am He comforts you:
|    How then should you be afraid
|  of frail man that shall die, or of mortal
|    that passes away like the grass;
|  [51:13] And forgets the LORD  your Maker,
|    who stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth;
|  and lives in ceaseless dread
|    of the fury of the oppressor?
|  Where is now the oppressor’s fury,
|    who aimed at your destruction?
|  [51:14] Soon shall the captive be freed,
|    he shall not end in death and the pit,
|    nor suffer for lack of bread.

|  [51:15] I am the LORD  your God,
|    who stirs the sea into roaring waves:
|    The LORD  of Hosts is My name.
|  [51:16] And I put My words in your mouth,
|    in the shadow of My hand did I hide you,
|  when I stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth,
|    and said unto Zion, ‟My people are you.”

##### Jerusalem’s Affliction: Her Speedy Redemption and Glory #####

|  [51:17] Bestir you, bestir you; arise, O Jerusalem,
|    who have drunk at the hand of the LORD
|   The cup of His indignation,
|    and the bowl that bewilders have drained to the dregs.
|  [51:18] Of all the sons you have borne
|    there is not man to guide you;
|  of all the sons you have reared
|    there is none to take your hand.
|  [51:19] A twofold woe has befallen you;
|    who may with you condole?
|  Wreck and Ruin, Famine and Sword –
|    and who may comfort you?
|  [51:20] Your sons in a swoon were lying
|    like an antelope in a net,
|  filled full with the LORD ’s fury
|    and with the rebuke of your God.
|  [51:21] Therefore hear now this, you afflicted one,
|    drunken, but not with wine:
|  [51:22] Thus says your Lord the LORD,
|    your God who defends His people:
|  ‟Behold, from your hand I have taken
|    the cup that brings bewilderment;
|  the chalice of My fury
|    you shall never drink again.
|  [51:23] I will hand it to your tormentors,
|    to those that afflicted you,
|  and commanded you to bow down
|    that they might pass over you:
|  Yea, you made your back like the ground,
|    like a street for men to pass over.”

 [Isaiah 52] 

|  [52:1] Awake, awake, O Zion,
|    put on your garment of strength;
|  put on your glorious raiment,
|    o Holy City, Jerusalem:
|  For never shall enter you more
|    the uncircumcised or unclean.
|  [52:2] Shake yourself from the dust,
|    and arise, O captive Jerusalem;
|  loose you the bands of your neck,
|    o captive daughter of Zion.

[52:3] For thus says the LORD, ‟For nought were you sold and[52:4] without money shall you be redeemed.” For thus says the Lord the LORD, ‟My people went down at the first to Egypt to sojourn there; and Assyria oppressed them[52:5] without cause. And now,” says the LORD, ‟wherein have I been advantaged here, in that My people have been taken away for nought? See! those who waited for Me,” says the LORD, ‟are become a byword, and My name is ever ceaselessly reviled. Therefore in that day shall My people know My name, that it is I who have promised. Behold, it is I.”

|  [52:7] How fair are the feet on the mountains
|    of him that proclaims good tidings,
|  the herald of peace and good tidings,
|    that brings the news of deliverance,
|  that says unto Zion,
|    ‟Your God reigns.”
|  [52:8] Your watchmen lift up their voices
|    in jubilant cries together,
|  for eye to eye they look
|    on the LORD  returning to Zion.
|  [52:9] You ruins of wasted Jerusalem,
|    break into singing together:
|  For the LORD  comforts His people,
|    he brings Jerusalem redemption.

|  [52:10] In the sight of all nations the LORD
|     Has bared His holy arm;
|  and all the ends of the earth
|    shall see how our God has saved us.
|  [52:11] Away, away. get you hence,
|    and touch no unclean thing;
|  get you forth from her, make yourselves pure,
|    you that bear the vessels of the LORD .
|  [52:12] Nor need you go forth in haste,
|    nor depart as though you were fugitives;
|  for the LORD  goes before you,
|    and Israel’s God is your rear guard.

#### The Humiliation and Exaltation of the Servant ####

##### The servant: His Sufferings and His Great Glory #####

|  [52:13] See, Israel My Servant shall yet be exalted
|    and raised exceeding high.
|  [52:14] And as many were erstwhile appalled at his fate
|    (And kings at his destiny shuddered),
|  [52:15] so many a nation shall yet do him homage
|    and kings shall be silent for awe of him.

|  For what they had never been told shall they see,
|    they shall gaze upon things unheard of before.

 [Isaiah 53] 

|  [53:1] ‟Who could have ever believed” (they shall say)
|    ‟Such a tale as that which we hear?”
|  And to whom has the arm of the LORD
|     Been ever so revealed?

##### The Sorrows, Humiliation, and Death of the Servant #####

|  [53:2] He grew like a sapling before us,
|    a shoot out of ground that was dry;
|  no beauty had he to attract us,

 [Isaiah 52] 

|    No figure to win our regard;
|  [52:14b] He was marred beyond human semblance,
|  [52:14c] He looked like a man no more.

 [Isaiah 53] 

|  [53:3] He was spurned and forsaken of men,
|    familiar with suffering and pain;
|  as one from whom men hide their faces,
|    he was spurned and we heeded him not.

|  [53:4] But *ours* was the pain that *he* bore,
|    and the sorrows he carried were ours;
|  yet by *us* he was counted as smitten
|    and tortured by God’s own hand.
|  [53:5] But ours was the sin that pierced him,
|    the guilt that crushed him was ours:
|  Yea, *he* was chastised for *our* welfare,
|    and *his* stripes brought healing to *us*.

|  [53:6] We had all of us wandered like sheep,
|    each turning a way of his own,
|  while the LORD  had laid upon *him*
|    The iniquity of us all.

|  [53:7] Though outraged, he was submissive,
|    he opened not his mouth;
|  like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
|    or sheep that with shearers is dumb.

|  [53:8] He was dragged away by injustice,
|    and who gave a thought to his fate?
|  He was torn from the land of the living,
|    and smitten to death for the sins that were ours.

|  [53:9] His grave was appointed with rebels,
|    his funeral mound with the wicked;
|  although he had done no violence,
|    nor was any deceit in his mouth.

##### The Servant’s Ultimate Exultation and Glory #####

|  [53:10] ’Twas the will of the LORD  that crushed him with pain;
|    but by yielding himself as an offering for sin,
|  he shall yet see an offspring, his days shall be long,
|    and the purpose of God shall through him be triumphant.

|  [53:11] For He has delivered his soul from anguish,
|    his eyes He has filled with abundance of light.”
|  ‟In the of the many My Servant stands justified,
|    theirs is the guilt that this man bears.

|  [53:12] For this he shall win with the great an inheritance,
|    he with the strong shall divide the spoil;
|  because he had poured out his soul unto death,
|    and had suffered himself to be numbered with rebels;
|  though the sins that he bore were the sins of the world,
|    and for those very rebels he had offered his prayer.”

#### The Future Glory of Jerusalem ####

 [Isaiah 54] 

|  [54:1] Sing, you barren, that did not bear,
|    you that travailed not, break forth into singing;
|  for more are the sons of the woman forlorn
|    than the sons – says the LORD  – of her that is married.

|  [54:2] Enlarge the space for your tent,
|    and stretch out your canvas unstintingly;
|  lengthen your cords, and your stakes fasten well,
|  [54:3] For to right and to left shall you spread.
|  Your sons shall possess the nations,
|    and people the cities now desolate.

|  [54:4] Fear not, for never shall you be ashamed,
|    nor put to the blush, therefore be not confounded.
|  The shame of your youth you shall clean forget,
|    and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.

|  [54:5] For your husband is He that made you,
|    the LORD  of Hosts is His name;
|  your Redeemer is Israel’s Holy One,
|    the God of all the earth.

|  [54:6] As a wife forsaken and grieved.
|    To Himself has the LORD  recalled you;
|  can a wife wooed in youth be rejected?
|    Thus says the LORD  your God.

|  [54:7] I forsook you a little while,
|    but in great compassion I will gather you;
|  [54:8] In a burst of wrath for a moment
|    I hid my face from you,
|  but with love everlasting I pity you,
|    says the LORD  your Redeemer.

|  [54:9] Like the days of Noah are these days to Me:
|  As I sware that the waters of Noah
|    should no more pass over the earth,
|  so I swear I shall never again
|    be angry with you, or rebuke you.

|  [54:10] Though the mountains should remove,
|    and the hills be utterly shaken,
|  yet from you shall My love never move,
|  nor My covenant of peace be shaken,
|    says the LORD, who pities you.

|  [54:11] You that wast sore afflicted,
|    tossed by the storm and uncomforted,
|      Behold,
|  your base I will set in rubies,
|    in sapphires your foundations.
|  [54:12] I will make your pinnacles jasper,
|    your gates of carbuncle stones,
|    and all your borders of jewels.
|  [54:13] The LORD  shall teach your builders,
|    and greatly prosper your children;
|  [54:14] Through righteousness shall you endure.
|  Far shall you be from oppression,
|    yea, you shall have nothing to fear:
|  Far shall you be from destruction,
|    it shall not come nigh unto you.
|  [54:15] If any should stir up strife,
|    it cometh not from Me;
|  who stirs up strife against you
|    shall fall upon you to his ruin.
|  [54:16] Behold! It is I who created the smith
|    that blows the fire of coals,
|  bringing weapons forth for their work.
|    It is I who created Destroyer to ravage.
|  [54:17] Success shall never attend
|    the weapon forged against you;
|  the tongue that is raised against you
|    shall be worsted evermore.
|  Such is the lot of the LORD ’s Servants,
|    and this will I vindicate them, says the LORD .

##### The Blessings in Store for Israel #####

 [Isaiah 55] 

|  [55:1] Ho! all that are thirsty, come you to the waters,
|    and you that have no money, come;
|  buy you and eat without money,
|    buy wine and milk without price.
|  [55:2] Why spend you silver for that which can satisfy no one?
|  And your money for that which can satisfy no one?
|  If you hearken to Me, you shall eat what is good,
|    and your soul shall be ravished with dainties.

|  [55:3] Incline your ear and come unto Me,
|    hear, that your soul may revive;
|  for with you I will enter a bond everlasting
|    of kindness, once promised to David and sure.
|  [55:4] For, as once to the nations I made him My Witness,
|    appointing him Prince and Commander of nations,
|  [55:5] So now shall you summon a people you know not,
|    people who know you not shall run unto you,
|  for the sake of the LORD  your God,
|    the Holy One of Israel,
|    because He has girt you with glory.

##### The Wonderful Salvation is Near: Forth, then, from Babylon! #####

|  [55:6] Seek you the LORD, while He may be found,
|    call you upon Him, while He is near.
|  [55:7] Let the wicked forsake his way,
|    and the sinful man hi thoughts;
|  let him turn unto the LORD,
|    and He will have pity upon him –
|  And unto our God, for He
|    will plentifully pardon.
|  [55:8] For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
|    nor are your ways Mine, says the LORD :
|  [55:9] But as heaven is higher than earth,
|    so are My ways higher than your ways,
|    and My thoughts higher than your thoughts.

|  [55:10] For even as the rain and the snow
|    that descend from the heaven, return not
|  without having watered the earth,
|    and caused it to bear and sprout,
|    giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
|  [55:11] Even so shall it be with the word
|    that has issued out of My mouth:
|  It shall not return to Me void,
|    it shall execute My pleasure,
|    and carry My mission to triumph.

|  [55:12] For with joy shall you go forth,
|    and in peace shall you be led out;
|  the mountains and the hills
|    shall break into singing before you,
|  and all the trees of the forest
|    shall clap their hands together.
|  [55:13] For the thorn shall come up the fir,
|    for the brier shall come up the myrtle;
|  it shall be for the LORD ’s renown,
|    for a sign everlasting that never shall perish.

##### Later Voices of Rebuke, Threat, and Promise #####

#### A Word of Cheer to Those who are in Danger of Being Excluded from the Church ####

 [Isaiah 56] 

|  [56:1] Thus says the LORD :
|  “Keep the law, and do that which is right:
|  For soon My deliverance cometh,
|    my justice will soon be revealed.”
|  [56:2] Happy the man who thus doeth,
|    the mortal that holds it fast –
|  He that keeps the Sabbath unsullied,
|    that keeps his hand from all evil.

|  [56:3] And let not the foreigner say,
|    who has joined himself unto the LORD,
|  “the LORD  will separate me
|    most assuredly form His people.”
|  And let not the eunuch say,
|    “Behold, a dry tree am I.”

|  [56:4] For thus says the LORD :
|    “The eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths,
|  make choice of the things I delight in,
|    and hold My covenant fast –
|  [56:5] In My house and within My walls
|    I will give them a name and a monument
|    better than sons and daughter:
|  I will give them a name everlasting
|    that never shall be cut off.
|  [56:6] And the foreigners joined to the LORD,
|    that serve Him and love His name,
|    and are pledged to be His servants –
|  All that keep the Sabbath unsullied
|    and hold His covenant fast –
|  [56:7] I will bring to My holy Mountain;
|    and fill them with joy in My House of Prayer
|  their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices
|    shall be welcomed upon Mine altar.
|  And My House shall be known by the name,
|    ’House of Prayer for every nation.’”

|  [56:8] Thus says the Lord the LORD,
|    who gathers the outcasts of Israel:
|  “I will yet gather others to him
|    beside those that already are gathered.”

#### The Demoralization of Leaders and People ####

##### The Sensuous Leaders #####

|  [56:9] All you wild beasts of the field,
|    all you wild beasts of the forest,
|    come hither to devour.
|  [56:10] My watchmen are blind, every one,
|    with no knowledge of how to give heed.
|  Dumb dogs they are, every one of them,
|    lacking the power to bark;
|  but there they lie a-dreaming
|    in the slumber that they love.

|  [56:11] Yes, greedy dogs are they,
|    that never can have enough;
|  but each to his own way turns,
|    each on his own gain bent:
|  [56:12] “Come, wine let us fetch” (they say),
|    “Let us fill ourselves with drink,
|  and to-morrow shall be as to-day,
|    a royal uproarious day.”

 [Isaiah 57] 

|  [57:1] The righteous are being destroyed,
|    and no man lays it to heart;
|  the godly are swept away,
|    and no man gives it a thought.
|  ’Tis the wickedness prevailing
|    that sweeps the righteous away;
|  [57:2] But he enters into peace,
|    and those whose walk has been upright
|    do rest at last on their biers.

##### The Idolatrous People #####

|  [57:3] But *you* – hither approach,
|    you children of a sorcerers;
|  you offspring of whore and adulterer,
|  [57:4] Whom are you making sport of?
|  At whom are you making wide mouths,
|    and putting out our tongue?
|  Are you not apostate children,
|    a very brood of falsehood,
|  [57:5] That inflame yourselves at the oaks,
|    and under each green tree;
|  that in valleys slaughter children
|    amidst the clefts of the rocks?

|  [57:6] The slippery gods of the valley –
|    those, those you have taken for your portion.
|  Yes, to them you have poured your drink-offerings
|    and rendered on oblation:
|    And shall I with such things be appeased?
|  [57:7] And you did set your bed
|    on a high and lofty mountain,
|  and thither you did go
|    to offer up your sacrifice.

|  [57:8] Behind the door and the door-posts
|    your symbol you did set;
|  inflamed, you did uncover,
|    didst go up and enlarge your bed.
|  And you did purchase you lovers,
|  whose wantonness you loved;
|  and did multiply your whoredoms,
|    when your eyes beheld the phallus.

|  [57:9] For Melech you did anoint you
|    and Multiply your perfumes;
|  you did send your ambassadors far,
|    yea, down to the depths of Sheol.
|  [57:10] Though weary with many journeys,
|    you said not, “I despair.”
|  But ever new strength you gained,
|    and therefore you did not desist.

|  [57:11] Of whom wast you then in such abject terror
|    that you did play the traitor,
|  and gave no thought to Me,
|    nor did lay your duty to heart?
|  I hid Mine eyes in silence,
|    and Me you did not fear.
|  [57:12] But I will expose your doings,
|    this “righteousness” of your.

|  [57:13] When you cry, your hateful idols
|    shall profit you nothing, nor save you;
|  the wind shall lift them all,
|    and a breath shall take them away.
|  But who trusts in Me shall possess the land,
|    and inherit My holy Mountain.

#### Blessings in store for the Faithful ####

|  [57:14] O raise, raise a highway, and clear you a path,
|    take the stumbling-blocks out of the way of My people.
|  [57:15] For thus says He that is high and exalted,
|    whose throne is for ever, whose name is Holy:
|  “On high as the Holy One sit I enthroned,
|    and with him that is crushed, that is lowly in spirit;
|  to quicken the spirit of them that are lowly,
|    and the heart of all such as crushed to revive.

|  [57:16] For not for ever will I contend,
|    nor cherish Mine anger evermore;
|  for then would the spirits faint before Me,
|    the souls that I Myself have made.
|  [57:17] Because of his sin I was worth for a moment,
|    I smote him in anger and hid My face:
|  But he kept to the way of his rebel heart –
|  [57:18] I have noted his ways,” says the LORD .

|  “But now will I bring to him healing and rest,
|    and requite him with full consolation.
|  [57:19] The lips of his mourners shall blossom with praise,
|    when to far and to near I bring peace and prosperity.
|  Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”
|    [57:21] So peace there is none, says my God, to the wicked.

#### The true and the False Worship ####

##### Fasting #####

 [Isaiah 58] 

|  [58:1] Cry with full throat and refrain not,
|    lift up your voice like a trumpet;
|  declare to My people their sins,
|    and their guilt to the household of Jacob.
|  [58:2] Daily indeed they consult Me,
|    their joy is to learn My ways,
|  like a nation that doeth the right
|    and forsaken not the law of its God.

|  They ask Me to guide then aright,
|    they delight to draw nigh unto God.
|  [58:3] “Why look You not when we fast?” (they say)
|    “Why heed You not our self-chastening?”
|  But on fast-days you think of your business,
|    you drive all your workmen like slaves.
|  [58:4] See! you fast for strife and contention,
|    you smite the poor with your fists.

|  Such fasting as yours to-day
|    will not carry your prayers on high.
|  [58:5] Can such be the fast of My choice,
|    a day for self-mortification?
|  To bow one’s head like a bulrush,
|    to lie upon sackcloth and ashes –
|  Is this what you call a fast,
|    a day that the LORD  accepts?
|  
|  [58:6] Thus says the Lord the LORD :
|    Is the fast of My choice not this –
|  To loose the unjust fetters,
|    to undo the bands of the yoke,
|  to let those that are crushed go free,
|    and to snap each yoke in sunder,
|  [58:7] To break your bread to the hungry,
|    to bring the homeless home: –
|  When you see the naked, to cover him,
|    and to hide not yourself from your kinsmen?
|  [58:8] Then shall your light break forth as the dawn,
|    and your wounds shall be speedily healed.
|  In front shall your righteousness march,
|    with the LORD ’s own glory behind you.
|  [58:9] Then, when you call, the LORD  shall answer,
|    and say, when you cry for help, “Here am I.”
|  
|  If from your midst you remove the yoke,
|    the finger of scorn and the speech that is mischievous;
|  [58:10] If to the hungry you give your bread,
|    and the soul that is bowed you dost satisfy:
|  Then in the darkness your light shall arise,
|    and your gloom shall be as the noonday:
|  [58:11] The LORD  shall guide you for evermore,
|    and your soul in the land that is parched He will satisfy.
|  Your strength He will make new again,
|    and you like a well-watered garden shall be,
|    like a fountain of water, whose waters fail not.
|  [58:12] The ancient ruins your sons shall rebuild,
|    you shall rear once again the foundations of old;
|  and you shall be called the Repairer of Ruins,
|    who makes waste places a home again.

##### The Sabbath #####

|  [58:13] If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
|    from doing your business on My holy day,
|  and calls the Sabbath a sheer delight,
|    and the holy (day) of the LORD  honourable,
|  and honours it by not doing your wont,
|    nor heeding your business, nor speaking idly:
|  [58:14] Then shall you have your delight in the LORD,
|    and over the heights of the earth shall you ride;
|  I will give you the portion of Jacob your father
|    in full to enjoy, as the LORD  has promised.

#### The Sinful People and the Devine Deliverance ####

##### The Sins #####

 [Isaiah 59] 

|  [59:1] Behold, the hands of the LORD
|     Is not too short to save,
|    nor His ear too dull to hear.
|  [59:2] Your iniquities are the barrier
|    between your God and you;
|  your sins have hidden His face,
|    and therefore He will not hear you.

|  [59:3] For your hands are stained with blood,
|    and your fingers with iniquity;
|  your lips have uttered falsehood,
|    your tongue mutters depravity.
|  [59:4] No one sues the integrity,
|    no one with honesty pleads;
|  they trust in pretence and lies,
|    conceive trouble and bring forth mischief.

|  [59:5] Basilisks’ eggs they hatch,
|    and spiders’ webs they weave:
|  Who eats their eggs shall die,
|    and the egg that is crushed breaks out as a viper.
|  [59:6] Their webs cannot serve as a garment,
|    with that which they fabricate no man can clothe himself;
|  for evil is what they fabricate,
|    their hands work deeds of violence.

|  [59:7] Their feet run to evil,
|    they haste to shed innocent blood;
|  their thoughts are thoughts of mischief,
|    their paths are Wreck and Ruin.
|  [59:8] The ways of peace they know not,
|    no justice is in their tracks:
|  For their own selfish ends they have twisted their paths;
|    who treads thereon is a stranger to peace.

##### The Confession #####

|  [59:9] For this cause our right remains far,
|    and no victory yet overtakes us;
|  we look for the light, but lo! darkness –
|    for brightness, but walk in the gloom.
|  [59:10] We grope, like the blind, by the wall,
|    yea, like men that are sightless we grope;
|  we stumble at noon as in twilight,
|    in darkness we dwell like the dead.
|  [59:11] We all of us roar like bears,
|    like doves we sadly mourn;
|  we look – but in vain – for justice,
|    salvation is far away.

|  [59:12] Our transgressions before You are many,
|    our sins do witness against us,
|  our transgressions are ever with us,
|    we know our iniquities well –
|  [59:13] Rebellion, denial of the LORD,
|    and turning away from our God,
|  speaking revolt and perverseness,
|  and uttering lies from the heart.
|  [59:14] Justice is driven back,
|    and righteousness stands afar;
|  in the market-place truth stumbles,
|    and rectitude cannot enter.
|  [59:15] So truth is not to be found,
|    and insight departs from the city.
|  At the sight was the LORD  displeased,
|    he was angry that justice was lacking.

##### The Deliverance #####

|  [59:16] He saw with utter amaze
|    not a man to interpose;
|  so His own arm wrought Him deliverance,
|    his righteous might upheld Him.
|  [59:17] He put on the breastplate of righteousness,
|    on His head the helm of salvation;
|  he put on the garments of vengeance,
|    in the mantle of passion He clothed Him.

|  [59:18] He renders recompense matching desert –
|    wrath to His enemies, shame to His foes:
|  [59:19] So shall those in the west fear the name of the LORD,
|    and those at the sunrise behold His glory.
|  He shall come like a pent-up stream,
|    which the breath of the LORD  drives.
|  [59:20] But to Zion He comes as Redeemer,
|    and removes transgressors from Jacob.

|  [59:21] This covenant with them I make, says the LORD  –
|  My spirit that is upon you,
|    and the words I have put in your mouth –
|  Shall not depart form your mouth,
|    nor from the mouth of your children,
|  nor yet from the mouth of your children’s children,
|    says the LORD, from the henceforth and evermore.

#### The Glory of the New Jerusalem ####

 [Isaiah 60] 

|  [60:1] Arise, shine, for your light is now come,
|    and on *you* is the LORD ’s own glory arisen.
|  [60:2] For, though darkness covers the earth,
|    and the nations are wrapped in gloom,
|  yet on *you* the LORD  shines forth,
|    over *you* His glory appears.
|  [60:3] And nations shall come to the light that *you* shed,
|    and kings to the brightness that streams from *you*.
|  [60:4] Lift up your eyes round bout and behold
|    how they flock to you, all of them gathered together –
|  Your sons coming in from afar,
|    on the arms of their nurses your daughters.
|  [60:5] At the sight of them you shall be radiant,
|    your heart shall tremble and throb;
|  for the wealth of the sea shall be turned unto you,
|    unto you shall the nations come in with their treasures.

|  [60:6] A stream of camels shall cover you,
|    young camels of Midian and Ephah;
|  all those of Sheba shall come,
|    laden with gold and frankincense,
|    and tell of the LORD ’s renown.
|  [60:7] All the flocks of Kedar
|    shall gather unto you,
|    and the rams of Nebaioth shall seek you;
|  they shall mount with acceptance Mine altar,
|    and my House of Prayer shall be radiant with beauty.

|  [60:8] Who are these that fly like a cloud,
|    or like doves to their latticed cotes?
|  [60:9] For ships unto Me are gathering –
|    vessels of Tarshish in front –
|  To bring your sons from afar,
|    and with them their silver and gold,
|  to the name of the LORD  your God,
|    to the Holy One of Israel,
|    because He has girt you with glory.

|  [60:10] Strangers shall build your walls,
|    and their kings unto you shall be ministers;
|  for the wrath that moved Me to smite you
|    is turned into favour and pity.
|  [60:11] Your gates shall ever be open,
|    not shut by day or nigh,
|  that the wealth of nations be brought you –
|    their kings at the head of the train.
|  [60:12] For the nation and the kingdom
|    that serve you not shall perish:
|    Yea, utterly waste shall those nations be.

|  [60:13] The glory of Lebanon shall come unto you,
|    the pine-tree, the plane, and the cypress together,
|  that the House where My holiness dwells may be fair,
|    that the place where I walk may be covered with glory.
|  [60:14] The sons of those that afflicted and scorned you
|    shall come unto you, all lowly bending,
|  and give you the name of “the LORD ’s own City,
|    the Zion of Israel’s Holy One.”

|  [60:15] Whereas you have been forsaken,
|    unvisited, abhorred,
|  an eternal pride I make you,
|    a joy unto all generations.
|  [60:16] You shall suck the milk of nations,
|    yea, royal breasts shall you suck;
|  and then shall you know that I,
|    the LORD, am your Saviour,
|  and He that redeems you
|    is the Mighty One of Jacob.

|  [60:17] For brass I will bring in gold,
|    and silver instead of iron,
|  brass in the place of wood,
|    and iron in place of stones;
|  and Peace I will set to govern you,
|    and Justice to be your lord.
|  [60:18] Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
|    nor rapine nor ruin within your borders;
|  but a Sure Defence you shall call your walls,
|    and your gates you shall name Renown.

|  [60:19] The sin shall no more be your light by day,
|    nor yet shall the moon shed her brightness upon you;
|  but the LORD  shall be your eternal Light,
|    and your God shall be your glory.
|  [60:20] Your sun shall set no more,
|    your moon shall wane no more;
|  for the LORD  shall be your eternal Light,
|    and the days if your grief shall be ended.

|  [60:21] Your people shall all be righteous,
|    possessing the land for ever,
|  the shoot of the LORD ’s planting,
|    the work of His hands, for His glory.
|  [60:22] The smallest shall grow to a clan,
|    and the least to a mighty nation.
|  I (who have promised), the LORD,
|    will hasten it in its time.

#### The Proclamation of Zion’s Redemption ####

 [Isaiah 61] 

|  [61:1] The spirit of the LORD  the Lord is upon me,
|    because I have been by the LORD  anointed:
|  He has sent to me to bring glad news to the wretched,
|    to bind up hearts that are broken,
|  to proclaim release unto captives,
|    and freedom to men in bonds,
|  [61:2] To proclaim the year of the LORD ’s favour,
|    and the day of our God’s revenge,
|  to comfort all that mourn,
|    [61:3] To give them a garland for ashes,
|  the oil of joy for the garment of mourning,
|    a song of praise for a spirit bedimmed;
|  and oak-trees of righteousness they shall be called,
|    the plants of the LORD  reflecting His glory.

|  [61:4] They shall build the ancient ruins,
|    restoring the places long desolate,
|  renewing the wasted cities,
|    that age upon age have been desolate.
|  [61:5] Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,
|    and aliens shall be your ploughmen and vine-dressers:
|  [61:6] But *you* shall be called The Priests of the LORD,
|    the name you shall bear shall be Ministers of our God.
|  The wealth of the nations shall be yours to enjoy,
|    you shall deck yourselves with their splendour.

|  [61:7] A twofold measure of shame has been theirs,
|    and theirs was a lot of contempt and insult,
|  so now in their own land their share shall be doubled,
|    and theirs shall be joy everlasting.
|  [61:8] For I am the LORD, the lover of justice,
|    iniquitous plunder is hateful to Me;
|  faithfully then their reward I will give them,
|    and enter with them in a bond everlasting.

|  [61:9] Their sons shall be famous all over the world,
|    and their offspring among the nations;
|  then those that behold them shall all acknowledge
|    that this is the race that the LORD  has blessed.
|  [61:10] For as surely as earth puts forth her shoots,
|    and the seed springs up that is sown in a garden,
|  the LORD  the Lord will make victory spring,
|    and renown, before all the world.

|  [61:11] “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD,
|    my soul shall exult in my God,
|  who has clothed me in robes of salvation,
|    and decked me with mantle of victory,
|  like bridegroom that fixes his turban
|    or bride that adorns herself with her jewels.”

 [Isaiah 62] 

|  [62:1] For Zion’s sake I will not keep silence,
|    for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
|  till her victory issue forth clear as the light,
|    her deliverance bright as a burning torch,
|  [62:2] So that nations shall see you are victor indeed,
|    and kings, every one, shall behold your glory.
|  But you shall be called by a name that is new,
|    which the LORD ’s mouth shall determine.
|  [62:3] Fair crown shall you be in the hand of the LORD,
|    a diadem royal in the hand of your God.

|  [62:4] No more shall your name be Forsaken,
|    nor your land called Desolate more:
|  But your name shall be called My Delight,
|    and your land My Wedded Wife;
|  for the LORD  delights in you,
|    and your land shall indeed be wedded.
|  [62:5] For even as a youth weds a maiden,
|    so your Builder shall wed with you;
|  and as bridegroom rejoices in bride,
|    so your God shall rejoice over you.

|  [62:6] Over your walls, Jerusalem,
|    I have appointed watchmen;
|  all the day and night
|    they never hold their peace.
|  You whose task it is
|    to keep the LORD  in mind,
|    [62:7] Take to yourselves no rest,
|  and give no rest unto Him,
|    until that He establish,
|  until that He make Jerusalem
|    renowned in the earth.
|  [62:8] By His right hand the LORD  has sworn,
|    and by His mighty arm:
|  “Never again will I suffer
|    your foes to devour your corn;
|  never again shall strangers
|    drink the wine for which you have toiled.
|  [62:9] Bur those that have garnered shall eat it,
|    with songs of praise to the LORD ;
|  and those that have gathered shall drink it
|    within My holy courts.”

|  [62:10] Pass you, pass through the gates,
|    prepare you a way for the people;
|  cast you, cast up the highway,
|    and gather out the stones,
|    and raise for the peoples a banner.
|  [62:11] Behold, to the ends of the earth
|    has the LORD  made proclamation:
|  Say to the daughter of Zion,
|    behold, your salvation is come.
|  Behold His reward is with Him,
|    and His recompense before Him,
|  [62:12] They shall call them the Holy People,
|    the Redeemed of the LORD,
|  and you shall be called Frequented,
|    the City Unforsaken.

#### The Destruction of the Foes of Zion ####

 [Isaiah 63] 

|  [63:1] “Who is this that cometh from Edom,
|    in bright-red garments from Bozrah,
|  so glorious in hi apparel,
|    marching in fullness of strength?”
|  “It is I, that have promised deliverance,
|    I that am mighty to save.”

|  [63:2] “Why is your raiment so red,
|    and your garments like his that treads in the wine-press?”
|  [63:3] “I have trodden the wine-trough alone,
|    of the nations was no man with Me;
|  so I trod them in Mine anger,
|    and trampled them down in My fury;
|  their life-blood besprinkled My garments,
|    and all Mine apparel I stained.

|  [63:4] In My heart was the day of revenge,
|    and the year of redemption was come.
|  [63:5] I looked with utter amaze –
|    there was none to help or uphold;
|  so Mine own arm, wrought Me the victory,
|    my fury – it upheld Me.
|  [63:6] In Mine anger I trod down the peoples,
|    in My furry I broke them in pieces:
|    Their life-blood I spilt on the ground.”

#### Passionate Prayer for the Divine Favour ####

##### Thanksgiving for Ancient Mercies #####

|  [63:7] The LORD ’s renown I would celebrate –
|    all His loving-kindness –
|  As befits the deeds that the LORD,
|    so rich in goodness, has wrought for us,
|    even for the household of Israel –
|  Wrought for us in His pity
|    and loving-kindness great.
|  [63:8] “Surely My people are they,” He said,
|    “Sons that will not prove false.”
|  And so He became their Saviour
|    from all that did distress them.

|  [63:9] No envoy was it or angel,
|    but His own very presence that saved them:
|  In His love and in His pity
|    he did Himself redeem them;
|  he took them up and carried them
|    all the days of old.
|  [63:10] But as for them, they resisted,
|    and grieved His holy spirit;
|  so He turned to be their foe,
|    and Himself did fight against them.

|  [63:11] Then (Israel) remembered
|    the days of the old time, (and said):
|  “Where is He that brought up from the sea
|    the shepherd of His flock?
|  And where is He that set
|    in their midst His holy spirit;
|  [63:12] That caused His glorious arm
|    to go at the right hand of Moses;
|  that cleft the waters before them,
|    to make Him a name everlasting;
|  
|  13a That led them through the depths
|    [63:13b] With steps that never faltered,
|  13c Like cattle that stray to the valley,
|    [63:14a] Or horse on the open pasture?
|  [63:14b] May Your spirit, the LORD, guide us,
|    as once You did lead Your people,
|    to make You a glorious name.”

##### Passionate Entreaty for the Devine Forgiveness and Pity #####

|  [63:15] Look down from heaven, and behold
|    from Your holy and glorious palace.
|  Where are Your zeal and Your prowess,
|    the voice of Your yearning and pity?
|  [63:16] Though Abraham knows us not,
|    and Israel does not regard us,
|  yet are You, O the LORD, our Father,
|    our Redeemer from of old is Your name.

|  [63:17] Why dost You leave us, the LORD,
|    to wander away from Your paths?
|  And why dost You suffer our hearts
|    to grow hard and strange to Your fear?
|  O return for Your Servants’ sake,
|    for the sake of the tribes of Your heritage.
|  [63:18] Why do the wicked make light of Your holy place?
|    Why do our enemies tread down Your Temple?
|  [63:19] We are grown like those whom You rule no more,
|    who have never been called by Your name.

 [Isaiah 64] 

|  [64:1] O that the heavens You would rend and come down,
|    that the mountains might quake at Your presence –
|  [64:2] As fire sets brushwood ablaze,
|    as fire causes water to boil –
|  To make known Your name to Your foes
|    so that nations might tremble before You,
|  [64:3] While terrible things you do,
|    surpassing our expectations,
|  [64:4] Unheard-of from olden time!
|  No ear has ever heard,
|    no eye has ever seen,
|  the mighty deeds You wilt do
|    for those that wait for You.
|  [64:5] O that you would meet
|    with those that are doers of righteousness,
|    those that remember Your ways!
|  But behold, You wast wroth with our sin,
|    and of broken faith were we guilty.

|  [64:6] We are all like men defiled,
|    like a blood-stained cloth is our righteousness;
|  we are all like withered leaves,
|    swept away by the blast of our guilt.
|  [64:7] There is none that calls on Your name,
|    or bestirs himself to lay hold of You.
|  For Your face You have hidden from us,
|    and delivered us up to our guilt.

|  [64:8] But now, O the LORD, our Father are You;
|    we are the clay, and You are the Potter,
|    the work of Your hand are we all.
|  [64:9] O be not, the LORD, exceeding wroth,
|    and do not remember our guilt for ever.
|  Behold, look, we beseech You,
|    for we are all Your people.

|  [64:10] Your holy cities are now a desert,
|    jerusalem is accursed.
|  [64:11] Our holy and beautiful House,
|    wherein our fathers praised You,
|    has been burned up with fire;
|  and all the places we cherished
|    are lying now in ruins.
|  [64:12] At things like these, O the LORD,
|    can You restrain Yourself?
|  And wilt You still keep silence,
|    and afflict us very sore?

#### The Blessedness of the Faithful and the Doom of the Apostates ####

##### The Fate of the Apostates #####

 [Isaiah 65] 

|  [65:1] I was ready to offer an answer
|    to those that consulted Me not;
|  and to suffer Myself to be found
|    of those that had sought Me not.
|  “Here am I, here am I,” I said
|    to a people that call not upon Me.

|  [65:2] I spread out My hands all the day
|    to a rebel unruly people,
|  that walk in a way not good,
|    but after their own devices –
|  [65:3] A people who even to My face
|    continually provoke Me,
|  sacrificing in gardens
|    and burning incense on tiles –
|  [65:4] That sit among the graves,
|    and spend the night in caves,
|  that eat the flesh of swine
|    and unclean broth from their vessels –
|  [65:5] That say, “Keep by yourself,
|    keep away from me, lest I infect you.”
|  Such men are a smoke in My nostrils,
|    a fire that blazes for ever.
|  [65:6] Behold, it is written before Me:
|    I will not, says the LORD, keep silence,
|  [65:7] Until I have punished their guilt
|    and the guilt of their fathers together,
|  who have burned on the mountains incense,
|    and dishonoured Me on the hills.
|  So first their reward I will measure,
|    then into their bosom requite it.

##### The Destiny of the Faithful in the Impending Judgment #####

|  [65:8] Thus says the LORD :
|    As when new wine is found in the cluster,
|  and one says, “Destroy it not,
|    because it contains a blessing;”
|  Even so will I do for My Servants’ sake,
|    I will not destroy the whole.
|  [65:9] I will bring out of Jacob a seed
|    and from Judah and heir to My mountains:
|  The land shall be owned by My Chosen,
|    and there shall My Servants dwell.
|  [65:10] And Sharon shall then be a pasture for flocks,
|    and the valley of Anchor for cattle to rest in,
|    for My people who have sought Me.
|  [65:11] But you that forsake the LORD,
|    and forget My holy Mountain,
|  that spread forth a table for Fortune,
|    and pour out mixed wine unto Destiny:
|  [65:12] I destine you for the sword,
|    you shall all bow down to the slaughter.

|  For you answered not when I called,
|    I spake, but you did not listen;
|  you did that which was vile in My sight,
|    and made choice of the things that displeased Me.
|  [65:13] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD :
|  Behold, My Servants shall eat,
|    but you shall be hungry;
|  behold, My Servants shall drink,
|    but you shall be thirsty;
|  behold, My Servants shall be joyful,
|    but you shall be ashamed.
|  [65:14] Behold, My Servants shall shout
|    for gladness of heart;
|  but for sorrow of heart *you* shall cry,
|    you shall wail for vexation of spirit.
|  [65:15] Behold, you shall leave your name
|    for My Chosen to curse by:
|  Behold, by a far other name
|    shall My Servants be called.

|  [65:16] He that prays in the land for a blessing
|    shall appeal to the God of truth;
|  and he that swears in the land
|    shall swear by the God of truth –
|  When the former distress is forgotten
|    and hidden from Mine eyes:
|  [65:17] For behold I will soon create
|    the heavens and the earth anew.

##### The Glorious Future #####

|  The past shall not be remembered,
|    nor come into mind again;
|  [65:18] But men shall for ever rejoice and exult
|    over this My (new) creation.
|  For behold! I will straightway create
|    jerusalem a rejoicing,
|    and her people an exultation;
|  [65:19] For I will exult in Jerusalem,
|    and in My people rejoice.

|  No more shall be heard within her
|    the voice of weeping or crying;
|  [65:20] No more shall be found therein
|    a babe of (a few brief) days,
|  or an old man who has not completed
|    the full tale of his days;
|  but he that dies the youngest
|    shall have lived for a hundred years,
|  and he that dies less than a hundred
|    shall be counted a man accursed.

|  [65:21] They shall dwell in the homes they have built,
|    eat the fruit of the vines they have planted;
|  [65:22] No others shall dwell in the homes your have built,
|    nor shall others enjoy what they planted.
|  For the days of My folk shall be many
|    as the days of the life of a tree,
|  and the work that their hands have achieved
|    shall My Chosen enjoy to the end.

|  [65:23] They shall not labour in vain,
|    nor rear their children to perish;
|  for a race that is blest of the LORD  are they,
|    and their offspring shall live by their side.
|  [65:24] I will answer or ever they call,
|    I will hearken while still they are speaking.
|  [65:25] The wolf and the lamb shall then pasture together,
|    and the lion eat straw like the ox:
|    But the serpent – its food shall be dust.
|  None shall do hurt, says the LORD, or havoc,
|    on all My holy Mountain.

##### Doom Pronounced upon those who Purpose to Build a Rival Temple #####

 [Isaiah 66] 

|  [66:1] Thus says the LORD :
|    The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool;
|  what manner of house would you build Me?
|    What manner of home would you rear?
|  [66:2] For all this is the work of My hand,
|    and these things are all Mine, says the LORD .
|  But this is the man I regard –
|    the afflicted and broken in spirit,
|    who trembles at My word.

|  [66:3] Oxen they kill forsooth –
|    but men they also slay;
|  and sheep they sacrifice –
|    but dogs they also strangle:
|  They offer their oblations –
|    but also the blood of swine;
|  they bring their memorial incense,
|    but they also bless the idol.

|  Such are the ways *they* have chosen,
|    foul rites are the joy of their soul;
|  [66:4] So *I* choose that *they* shall be harassed,
|    the things that they dread I will bring on them:
|  Because, when I called, none responded;
|    they listened not, when I spoke,
|  but did that which was vile in My sight,
|    and made choice of the things that displeased Me.

##### The Faithful Cheered by the Prospect of Zion’s Prosperity #####

|  [66:5] Hear you the word of the LORD,
|    you that at *His* word tremble:
|  Your brethren, that hate you and loathe you
|    for My name’s sake, have said:
|  “Let the LORD  show forth His glory
|    that we too may look on your joy:”
|    But *they* shall put to shame.
|  [66:6] Hark! from the City an uproar.
|    Hark! from the Temple it cometh.
|  Hark! ’tis the LORD  Himself
|    dealing recompense unto His foes.

|  [66:7] But *she* has brought forth a son
|    before her hour of travail;
|  before her pains came upon her,
|    of a man-child was she delivered.
|  [66:8] Who has heard the like?
|    Who has seen aught like this?
|  Can it be that a single day
|    may see the birth of a people,
|    that a nation be born all at once?
|  For no sooner had Zion travailed
|    than she brought her sons to the birth.

|  [66:9] Shall *I* not help to bring forth
|    what I bring to the birth, says the LORD ?
|  Or shall I, having brought to the birth,
|    then close up the womb, says your God?
|  [66:10] O Jerusalem, rejoice,
|    and exult in her, all you that love her.
|  Be joyful with her exceedingly,
|    all you that mourned over her;
|  [66:11] That so you may suck to the full
|    from the breasts of her consolations,
|  and drain to your heart’s delight
|    the milk of her rich mother-bosom.
|  [66:12] For thus says the LORD : Behold,
|    I will set prosperity flowing
|  towards her, like a river in spate,
|    and the wealth of the world like a torrent.
|  Your babes shall be borne on the side
|    and dandled upon the knees;
|  [66:13] And as one whom his mother comforts,
|    even so will I comfort you:
|    In Jerusalem you shall be comforted.
|  [66:14] Your heart shall rejoice at the sight,
|    and your bones shall flourish like grass;
|  and then shall men perceive
|    how the LORD  loves His Servants,
|    and how wroth He can be with His foes.
|  [66:15] For behold, the LORD  shall come like a fire,
|    with chariots like the whirlwind,
|  to render His anger in burning heat,
|    his rebuke in flames of fire.

|  [66:16] For judgment the LORD  will hold on all flesh,
|    by fire and by His sword,
|    and the LORD ’s slain shall be many.
|  [66:17] Those that devote themselves
|    by rites of purification
|  to (worship in sacred) gardens,
|    with one in the centre to lead them –
|  That eat the flesh of swine,
|    of creatures that crawl, and mice –
|  [66:18] Their works and their thoughts, says the LORD,
|    shall come to an end together.

##### The Lord’s Glory Announced throughout the World: The Complete Restoration and Perpetuity of Israel #####

|  Behold, the time is come
|    to gather all nations and tongues;
|  they shall come and behold My glory,
|  [66:19] And a sign I will set among them.
|  And those that escape (the judgment)
|    I will send unto distant coasts,
|  such as have not heard of My fame,
|    nor yet have seen My glory.
|  They shall tell to the nations My glory;
|  [66:20] And out of all the nations
|    they shall all your brethren bring,
|  unto My holy Mountain,
|    to Jerusalem, says the LORD,
|  as an offering unto the LORD,
|    like the offerings brought to the Temple
|    by Israel in vessels pure.

|  [66:21] Some I will also take,
|    for Levitical priests, says the LORD .
|  [66:22] For as surely as the heavens
|    and the earth I create anew
|  shall abide, says the LORD, before Me,
|    your name and your race shall continue.

##### The Fearful Fate of the Apostates #####

|  [66:23] From one new moon to another,
|    one Sabbath to another,
|  shall all flesh come to worship
|    before Me, says the LORD .
|  [66:24] And forth they shall go, and look
|    on the corpses of the men
|    that have rebelled against Me –
|  Whose worm never dies,
|    whose fire is never quenched:
|    They are held by all flesh in abhorrence.


The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah
================================

##### Jeremiah’s Call and Early Visions #####

#### The Call ####

 [Jeremiah 1] 

v 1 The messages of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, amember of the priestly order resident in Anathoth inthe district of Benjamin.

[1:2] A message came to him from Jehovah in thethirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon,[1:3] king of Judah; and (such messages) continued tocome to him in the days of Jehoiakim, the son ofJosiah, king of Judah, and up to the end of theeleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king ofJudah, when in the fifth month the people ofJerusalem were swept into exile.

[1:4] This is the message that came to me from Jehovah:

|  [1:5] "My thoughts were upon thee before I created thee,
|    And before thou wast born I had set thee apart,
|    And appointed thee unto the nations a prophet."
|  [1:6] And thus I made answer:
|    "Alas! O Lord Jehovah, Behold!
|    I have no skill of speech, I am only a child."

[1:7] Then Jehovah made answer to me:

|  "Do not plead thou art still but a child,
|  Thou must go wheresoever I send thee,
|    And say whatsoever I bid thee.
|  [1:8] Be not afraid at the sight of them,
|  2 For I will be with thee to save thee."
|  [1:9] Thus spoke Jehovah; then with His outstretched hand
|  He touched my mouth and said to me:
|    "Herewith do I put My words in thy mouth,
|    [1:10] Behold this day do I give thee authority
|  Over the nations and over the kingdoms,
|    To uproot and demolish, destroy and tear down,
|    To upbuild and to plant."

#### The Reassuring Vision of the Almond Tree ####

|  [1:11] This further message came to me from Jehovah:
|    "What seest thou there, Jeremiah?" (said the Voice).
|  [1:12] "A branch of an almond tree," I answered. "Thou
|  hast seen truly," said Jehovah," for I am watching?
|  over My purpose, to perform it."

#### The Vision of the Caldron of War ####

[1:13] Then there came to me a second message fromJehovah. "What seest thou now?" (said theVoice). "A boiling pot," I answered, "facing the

|  [1:14] north." Then Jehovah said to me:
|  From the north shall disaster break forth
|    Over all that inhabit the land.
|  [1:15] For I, saith Jehovah, do summon
|    The northern kingdoms all;
|  Each king shall come and set hi throne
|    At the gates that lead into Jerusalem,
|  And against her encircling walls,
|    And against all the cities of Judah.
|  [1:16] I will utter My judgments against them
|    Because of their wickedness;
|  For Me they have forsaken,
|    And to to other gods offered sacrifice,
|    And bowed to the work of their hands.

#### The Divine Summons and the Divine Assurance ####

|  [1:As] for thee, gird up thy loins,
|    Arise and declare unto them
|    Whatsoever I command thee.
|  Let the sight of them not dismay thee,
|    Else I will dismay thee before them.
|  [1:18] As for Me, behold! This day
|    As a fortified city I make thee,
|  A pillar of iron, a wall of bronze,
|    Against the whole of the land–
|  The kings and the courtiers of Judah,
|    The priests and the folk of the land.
|  [1:They] will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor:
|    For I – saith Jehovah most solemnly–
|    I will be with thee to save thee.

##### The Earlier Messages of Jeremiah #####

#### Israel’s Ancient Fidelity and Happiness ####

 [Jeremiah 2] 

[2:1] There came to me this message from Jehovah:

|  [2:2] Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:
|  Thus saith Jehovah:
|  I remember the love of thy youth–
|    An affectionate bride wast thou–
|  When thou followedst Me in the desert,
|    A land that was all unsown;
|  [2:3] Then Israel belonged to Jehovah,
|    His first-fruits, sacred to Him.
|  Whosoever devoured her was punished,
|    On such did disaster fall.

#### Israel’s Long Record of Infidelity with its Bitter Consequences ####

##### Her Ingratitude and Unparalleled Apostasy #####

|  [2:4] Hear the word of Jehovah, O household of Jacob,
|    And all ye families of the household of Israel:
|    [2:5] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  What wrong did your fathers discover in Me,
|    That they went from Me afar,
|  To follow after vanities,
|    Till they, too, becane a vanity,
|  [2:6] And never sought afer Jehovah,
|    Who brought them up out of Egypt,
|  And led them through the desert,
|    A land of steppes and pits,
|  A land of drought and gloom,
|    A land that no man traversed,
|    A lanf where no man dwelt?
|  [2:7] And I brought you into a garden-land,
|    To enjoy its fruits and its good things:
|  But ye came and defiled My land
|    And made Mine inheritance loathsome,
|  [2:8] No priest was heard any more
|    Enquiring afer Jehovah;
|  They that handle the law did not know Me,
|    The rulers rebelled against Me.
|  The prophets spoke by Baal,
|    And followed useless idols.
|  [2:9] I must therefore contend with you still,
|    And with your children’s children.
|  [2:10] Pass across to the isles of Cyprus,
|    Or send afar unto Kedar;
|  Note carefully, and see,
|    Hath there ever been aught like this?
|  [2:11] Hath ever a nation exchanged its gods,
|    Though they be no gods at all?
|  But My people hath exchanged
|    Their Glory for useless idols.
|  [2:12] Be appaled at this, ye heavens,
|    And shudder exceedingly.
|  [2:13] For My people, saith Jehovah,
|    Have done two evil things:
|  Me they have forsaken,
|    The Fountain of Living Water,
|  To hew for themselves leaking cisterns,
|    That can hold no water at all.

##### The Consequences of Israel’s Apostasy #####

|  [2:14] Is Israel a servant?
|    Or is he a home-born slave?
|  Why then hath he fallen a prey?
|  [2:15] And why are his cities wasted?
|  Young lions have roared against him,
|    And lifted up their voice;
|  They have made his land all desolate,
|    And no man dwelleth therein.
|  [2:16] Yea, the people of Memphis and Daphnae
|    Have shorn the crown of thy head;
|  [2:17] And is this not come upon thee
|    Through forsaking Jehovah thy God?
|  [2:18] Now why dost thou wander to Egypt
|    And drink the waters of Nile?
|  And why dost thou go to Assyria,
|    To drink of the streams of Euphrates?
|  [2:19] Thy defection shall bring thee pain,
|    And thy wickedness sore reproof;
|  Thou shalt know and see for thyself
|    What a bitte thing it is
|    To forsake Jehovah thy God,
|  And to cherish no awe of Me,
|    Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.

##### Israel’s Devotion to Idolatry #####

|  [2:20] For of old thou didst break thy yoke,
|    And burst thy bonds in sunder;
|  Thou saidst, "I refuse to serve:"
|    But high upon every hill
|  And under every green tree
|    Thou didst stretch thee, playing the harlot.
|  [2:21] Yet I as a choice vine had planted thee–
|    Sound was thy stock altogether;
|  But now art thou turned to be bitter,
|    Thou wild degenerate vine!
|  [2:22] For though thou shouldst wash thee with soda,
|    And take thee abundance of soap,
|  Yet the Lord, as He seeth thy guilt,
|    Shall declare it of deepest dye.
|  [2:23] How canst thou say, "All stainless am I,
|    I have not gone after the Baals"?
|  Look at thy way in the Valley,
|    And know what thou hast done.
|  A swift young camel art thou,
|    That courseth hither and thither,
|  [2:24] A heifer run wild in the desert,
|    Aglow with the heat of ther passion;
|  That snifeth the wind in her longing,
|    And who can turn her back?
|  No one need wearily seek her–
|    In her month she is sure to be found.
|  [2:25] Run not the shoes off thy feet,
|    And spare thy throat, lest it parch.
|  But thou saidst,"There is no hope – none:
|    For I am inlove with strangers,
|    And after them will I go."

##### The Impotence of the Gods solicited by Israel #####

|  [2:26] But Israel’s house shall be shamed
|    As a thief that is caught is ashamed–
|  They and their kings and their princes,
|    Their priests and their prophets together;
|  [2:27] That say to a stock, "My father,"
|    To a stone, "It is thou that hast borne me."
|  For unto Me they turned
|    Their backs and not their faces;
|  Yet in time of trouble they say,
|    "O rise Thou up and save us."
|  [2:28] But where are the gods thou didst make thee?
|    Let them arise, if they
|    Can save thee in time of trouble;
|  For as many as are thy cities,
|    So many thy gods, O Judah.
|  [2:29] Why do ye wrangle with Me?
|    For wicked ye are, every man of you;
|  Rebels are ye, saith Jehovah–
|    Rebels against Me, each man of you.
|  [2:30] In vain have I smitten your children,
|    They would not receive correction;
|  The sword hath devoured your prophets,
|    Like a lion that dealeth destruction,
|  [2:31] And yet ye are unafraid.
|    So hear ye the word of Jehovah:
|  Have I been a desert to Israel,
|    A dark and gloomy land?
|  Why then do ye say, "We are free,
|    We will come unto Thee nevermore?"
|  [2:32] Can a maid forget her ornaments,
|    Or a bride forget her sash?
|  Yet Me hath My people forgotten
|    Days and days without number.
|  [2:33] In quest of love how bravely
|    Thou trippest along thy way!
|  Small wonder thy deeds are so vile,
|    And thy way hath been all polluted.
|  [2:34] Yea, blood was found in thy skirts–
|    Of the lives of the innocent poor–
|  As though thou hadst caught them at theft!
|    For all this (I would therefore contend with thee);
|  [2:35] Yet thou hast said: "I am innocent,
|    Surely His anger is over."
|  But see, I will enter with thee into judgment,
|    Because thou dost claim to be sinless.
|  [2:36] Why runnest thou hither and thither
|    Witg so frivolous a heart?
|  Thou shalt yet reap shame from Egypt,
|    As thou has reaped shame from Assyria.
|  [2:37] Yea, thence shalt thou also go forth,
|    With thy hands upon thy head;
|    For those whom thou trustest Jehovah hath spurned,
|    And thou shalt not make good thine escape.

##### Judah the Faithless #####

 [Jeremiah 3] 

|  [3:1] If a man divorceth his wife,
|    And she goeth away from him
|  And becometh the wife of another,
|    Can she ever again be his?
|  Is such a woman as she
|    Not altogether polluted?
|  Bit thou hast played the harlot
|    With many and many a lover;
|  And canst thou dare to dream
|    Of returning to Me, saith Jehovah?
|  [3:2] Lift up thine eyes to the heights, and behold,
|    Where hast thou not been ravished?
|  Thou hast waited for them by the ways,
|    Like a Bedouin in the desert;
|  Thou hast stained the land by thy whoredoms,
|    And by thy wicked ways,
|  [3:3] And through thy many lovers
|    Thou hast let thysef be snared.
|  Thou hast a harlot’s forhead,
|    Refusing to be abashed,
|  [3:4] Yet but now has been calling Me Father
|    And Comrade of thy youth.
|  [3:5] "Can He keep His anger for ever,
|    Or cherished it to the end?
|  Yes, such were thy words; but they deeds
|    To the last degree were vile.

#### Judah’s Infidelity more Awful than Israel’s ####

[3:6] In the days of the King Josiah Jehovah said to me:"Hast thou seem what back-sliding Israel did? Shewent up on every high mountain and under every[3:7] green tree and ther she played the harlot. I hadhoped that, after all this, she would return to Me. Butno! she did not return. Her faithless sister Judah[3:8] saw that I had put back-sliding Israel away because ofher adultery, and that I had given her a bill of divorce;nevertheless faithless Judah was not at all afraid, but[3:9] she too went and played the harlot, defiling the landby her wanton whoredom, and committing adultery[3:10] with stones and stocks. Nevertheless, when faithlessJudah turned to Me, it was not with her whole heart,but only in pretence."

#### Offer of Pardon and Promise of Glory ####

[3:11] Then Jehovah said to me, "Backsliding Israel has[3:12] justified herself more than faithless Judah. Go andproclaim these words towards the north and say:O backsliding Israel, turn,
|    I will not look in anger upon thee;

|  For I am kind, saith Jehovah,
|    I keep not Mine anger for ever.
|  [3:13] But only acknowledge thy guilt–
|    That, disloyal to Jehovah thy God,
|  Thou hast lavished thy love upon strangers
|    Beneath every spreading tree,
|  And unto My voice, saith Jehovah,
|    Thou hast not inclined thine ear.

[3:14] Return, ye backsliding children, saith Jehovah,for I am your husband and lord; and I will takeone of you from each city and two from each clan,[3:15] and I will brring you to Zion, and give you rulers afterMy own mind, who shall tend you with wisdom and[3:16] skill. And when in those days you have grownnumerous and fruitful in the land, saith Jehovah, menshall speak no more of the ark of the covenant ofJehovah; it shall never enter their minds, they willneither think of it nor miss it, nor will they ever againmake another.

[3:17] At that time Jerusalem shall be called the Throneof Jehovah, and all the nations shall gather thereto;they shall follow no more the stubbornness of their[3:18] evil hearts. In those days the household of Judahshall join the household of Israel, and together theyshall come from the north land to the land that I gaveyour forefathers for an inheritance.

#### A Penitent Return will be met by the Divine Acceptance ####

|  [3:19] How glad, methought, shall I be
|    To give thee a place among sons,
|  To give thee a pleasant land,
|    An inheritance passing fair!
|  Me thought ye would call Me Father,
|    And follow Me evermore;
|  [3:20] But ye have been false unto Me,
|    As a woman is false to her lover.
|  [3:21] Hark! weeping is heard on the heights–
|    It is suppliant Israel crying,
|  Because they have walked perversely,
|    Forgetting Jehovah their God.
|  [3:22] "Return, ye backsliding I will heal."
|  "Behold, we are come unto Thee,
|    For Thou art Jehovah our God.
|  [3:23] The hills are but a dellusion,
|    And the orgies upon the mountains;
|  In Jehovah our God alone
|    Is Israel’s salvation.
|  [3:24] The Baal hath devoured the toil
|    Of our fathers from our youth–
|  Their sheep and their oxen together,
|    Their sons and their daughters together
|  [3:25] We would lay us down in our shame,
|    All covered with confusion;
|  For before our God we have sinned,
|    We and our fathers from youth
|    Even unto this very day;
|  And we have not hearkened at all
|  To the voice of Jehovah our God."

 [Jeremiah 4] 

|  [4:1] "O Israel, if thou wilt return," saith Jehovah,
|    If thou but return unto Me,
|  And put out of My sight those things that I loathe;
|    If thou raom not hither and thither;
|  [4:2] If sincerely and justly and truly
|    Thou swear, ’As Jehovah liveth,’
|  Then nations shall pray for a blessing like thine,
|    And in thee shall they make their boast.
|  [4:3] For thus saith Jehovah to the citizens of Judah,
|    And to them that dwell in Jerusalem:
|  Break up the ground that lies fallow,
|    And sow ye not among thorns;
|  [4:4] Circumcise ye your own selves to Jehovah,
|    Remove from your hearts the foreskin,
|  Ye citizens of Judah
|  And ye that dwell in Jerusalem;
|  Lest My fury go forth like fire
|    And blaze beyond all quenching,
|    Because of your evil doings."

#### The Impending Judgment to be Executed by a Foreign Invader ####

|  [4:5] Declare ye this message in Judah,
|    And publish it in Jerusalem;
|  Blow the trumpet throughout the land,
|    Cry aloud and say,
|  "Gather and let us betake ourselves
|    Into the fortified cities."
|  [4:6] Lift towards Zion a signal,
|    Flee ye for safety and stay out;
|  For disaster and fell destruction
|    I soon will bring out the north.
|  [4:7] A lion hath gone from his thicket;
|    The Devastator of nations
|  Hath left and gone forth from his place
|    To desolate the earth.
|  [4:8] Gird yourselves therefore with sackcloth,
|    Make ye lament and wail;
|    For the fierce glowing wrath of Jehovah
|    Doth turn not away nor leave us.
|  [4:9] The heart of the king and the princes
|    Shall fail int that day, saith Jehovah;
|  The priests shall be seized with horror,
|    And the prophets with amazement.
|  [4:10] They shall say "Ah, Lord Jehovah!
|  Ah! Surely Thou hast deluded
|    This people and Jerusalem,
|  Assuring us all would be well,
|    While the doth pierce to the soul."
|  [4:11] This message shall then be declared
|    To Jerusalem and this people:
|  A glowing wind from the desert
|    Cometh straight upon My people,
|  But not tp winnow or cleanse–
|  [4:12] Too keen is the blast for that.
|    So now I will utter My judgment upon them.
|  [4:13] Behold! he mounteth as clouds,
|    His chariots are like to the whirlwind,
|  His horses are swifter than eagles:
|    "Woe unto us! we are spoiled."
|  [4:14] Wash thy heart of wickedness,
|    Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved:
|  How long wilt thou harbour within thee
|    Thine evil imaginations?
|  [4:15] Hark! a message from Dan,
|    From Mount Ephraim, evil tidings;
|  [4:16] Procalaim it among the nations,
|    And publish it over Jerusalem.
|  Behold! leopards are coming
|    From a land that is far away,
|  They are raising loud their roar
|    Against the cities of Judah.
|  [4:17] Lying in wait in the fields,
|    They beset her round and round–
|  "Because," declareth Jehovah,
|    "She hath rebelled against Me."
|  [4:18] Thy doings and thy behaviour
|    Have brought these things upon thee;
|  This is the fruit of thy wickedness–
|    Bitter indeed it is,
|    It pierceth thy very heart.

#### The Prophet’s Anguish ####

|  [4:19] O the pain, the pain in my bosom,
|    The walls of my heart are athrob:
|  My heart is a tumuly within me,
|    I cannot hold my peace;
|  For the sound of the trumpet I hear,
|    The din and alarum of battle.
|  [4:20] Ruin doth break upon ruin,
|    For all the land is laid waste;
|  My tents of a sudden are spoiled,
|    Yea, all in a moment my curtains.
|  [4:21] How long must I look on the standard
|    And hear the sound of the trumpet?
|  [4:22] For foolish is my people,
|    And me they do not know;
|  Sottish children they are,
|    Devoid of understanding:
|  Wise are they to do evil,
|    But they know not how to do good.
|  [4:23] I looked at the earth, and behold! it was empty.
|    I looked at the heavens, and their light was gone,
|  [4:24] I looked at the mountains, and lo! they were trembling,
|    And all the hills moved to and fro.
|  [4:25] I looked and looked, but behold, there was no man,
|    And all the birds of the heaven had fled.
|  [4:26] I looked at the fruit-land: behold! it was desert,
|    And all the cities were fallen in ruins,
|    Laid waste by the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah.

#### The Irrevocable Doom ####

|  [4:27] For thus Jehovah hath said,
|    The land shall be all desolation.
|  [4:28] For this the earth shall mourn,
|    And the heavens above be black;
|  For I have not repented My words,
|    And I will not turn back from My purpose.
|  [4:29] At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen
|    The whole land taketh to flight;
|  They enter the thickets and caves,
|    They climb up on to the rocks.
|  Abandoned is very city,
|    And not a man dwelleth therein.
|  [4:30] Why, then, dost thou robe thee in scarlet,
|    And deck thee with jewels of gold,
|  And paintest thine eyes to enlarge them?
|    In vain dost thou make thyself fair.
|  They that doted on thee despite thee;
|    It is thy life that they seek.
|  [4:31] For a cry have I heard as of woman in travail,
|    A scream as of one bringing forth her first child.
|  Hark! ’tis the daughter of Zion
|    That gaspeth and spreadeth her hands,
|  Saying, "Ah! woe is me! I am faint,
|    I am sinking – the victim of muderers."

#### The Universal Corruption of the Nation ####

 [Jeremiah 5] 

|  [5:1] Run to tand fro through the streets of Jerusalem,
|    Look ye around and examine;
|  Search in her open spaces
|    If ye can find a man–
|  Any that acteth justly,
|    And seeketh after truth;
|  Then I – Jehovah declareth–
|    Will grant her My forgiveness.
|  [5:2] But even when they say, "By Jehovah,"
|    They are ready to swear to a lie.
|  [5:3] Dost Thou look then, Jehovah, on falsehood,
|    And not upon the truth?
|  To all Thy blows they were callous,
|    They refused to accept correction;
|  Their faces were harder than stone,
|    They refused to turn (and repent).
|  [5:4] "But these," thought I, "are the poor,
|    The people without understanding,
|  Who know not the way of Jehovah,
|    The ordinance of their God.
|  [5:5] I will get me unto the great men,
|    And unto them will I speak;
|  For they know the way of Jehovah,
|    The ordinance of their God."
|  But these very men have all broken the yoke,
|    And snapped the bonds asunder.
|  [5:6] Soon therefore shall they be slain
|    By a lion out of the forest;
|    A wolf from the steppes shal despoil them.
|  A leopard shall lurk by their cities,
|    And rend all that issue therefrom.
|  For many are their their transgressions,
|    And far they have turned away.
|  [5:7] How then for this can I pardon thee?
|    Thy children have forsaken Me,
|  Swearing by gods that are no gods;
|    And, when to the full I had fed them,
|  Adultery they committed,
|    They lodge in the houses of harlots.
|  [5:8] Well fed stallions were they,
|    Neighing each for his neighbour’s wife.
|  [5:9] And crimes like these, saith Jehovah,
|    Am I to leave unpunished?
|  Shall not My soul be avenged
|    On a nation such as this?

#### The Implacable Doom ####

|  [5:10] Get ye up to her vines and destroy them,
|    Make an utter end of them;
|  Take away her branches,
|    For they are not Jehova’s.
|  [5:11] For utterly faithless to Me
|    Are the households of Israel and Judah;
|  [5:12] They have denied Jehovah,
|    And said, "He will never do it;
|  No evil shall come upon us,
|    We shall see neither sword nor famine.
|  [5:13] The prophets are only wind,
|    The word is not in them:
|    So be it done unto them."
|  [5:14] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts:
|  Behold, MY word in thy mouth
|    I will make like a flaming fire,
|  And this people shall be as the fuel,
|    And it shall clean devour them.
|  [5:15] Behold, I am bringing against you,
|    O household of Israel, saith Jehovah,
|    A nation from afar,
|  An imperishable nation,
|    A very ancient nation,
|  A nation whose language thou knowest not,
|    Whose speech is strange unto thee.
|  [5:16] Like an open grave is their quiver,
|    And giants are they all:
|  [5:17] They shall eat up thy bread and thy harvest,
|    They shall eat up thy sons thy daughters,
|  They shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds,
|    They shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees,
|  They shall beat down the fortified cities,
|    Wherein thou didst trust, with the sword.
|  [5:18] But in those days, saith Jehovah,
|    I will not make a clean end of you.
|  [5:19] And in time to come, when ye say to Me,
|    "Why hath Jehovah our God
|  Done all these things unto us?"
|    Then shalt thou say unto them,
|  "As ye have forsaken Me,
|    And served alien gods in your land,
|  So ye shall be servants to strangers
|    In a land that is not your own."

#### The Utter Depravity of the People and their Religious Leaders ####

|  [5:20] Declare ye this in the household of Jacob,
|    And publish this message in Judah;
|  [5:21] Hear this, ye foolish and senseless people,
|    With eyes that see not, and ears that hear not.
|  [5:22] Fear ye not Me? saith Jehovah,
|    Tremble ye not at My presence,
|  Who hath set the sand as a bound for the sea,
|    As a barrier eternal which cannot be passed?
|  Its waters may toss, but they cannot prevail;
|    Its waves may roar, yet they cannot pass over it.
|  [5:23] But these people are stubborn, defiant in heart,
|    They are turned aside and gone.
|  [5:24] For they do bot say in their hearts,
|    "Let us fear Jehovah, our God,
|  Who giveth the rain in its season,
|    The early and latter rain,
|  And into us reseveth
|    the weeks appointed for harvest."
|  [5:25] This order your sins have disturbed,
|  Your crimes have withheld from you blessing.
|  [5:26] For among My people are knaves,
|    Who set snares and with traps catch men.
|  [5:27] Like a cage full of birds, so their houses
|    Are full of (the gains of) deceit;
|  And so they grow great and rich,
|    [5:28] They are waxen fat, they are sleek:
|    They run riot in deeds of wickedness.
|  They defend not the rights of the orphan,
|    Nor champion the cause of the needy.
|  [5:29] And things like these, saith Jehovah,
|    Am I to leave unpunished?
|  Shall not My soul be avenged
|    On a nation such as this?
|  [5:30] An appailing, a horrible thing
|    Is come to pass in the land.
|  [5:31] The prophets prphesy falsely,
|    And from them do the priests take their teaching,
|  And My people love it so;
|    But what will ye do in the end?

#### The Approach of the Invader ####

 [Jeremiah 6] 

|  [6:1] Flee ye for safety, ye Benjamites,
|    Forth from the midst of Jerusalem;
|  Blow ye the trump in Tekoa,
|    Raise a beacon on Beth-haccherem:
|  For out of the north there peereth
|    Disaster and fell destruction.
|  [6:2] As a fair and luxurious mead
|    Is the height of the daughter of Zion;
|  [6:3] But shepherds shall come to assail her,
|    They and their flocks together;
|  They shall pitch their tents around about her,
|    And graze on her, each were he camps.
|  [6:4] "Prepare ye war agaisnt her;
|    Up! let us storm her at noon-day."
|  "Alas! for the day declineth,
|    The shadows of evening are lengthening."
|  [6:5] "Then up! let us storm her by night,
|    And her palaces let us destroy."
|  [6:6] For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|  Hew ye down her trees,
|    And cast up a mound against her.
|  Woe to thee, City of Falsehood,
|    Within thee is nothing but tyranny.
|  [6:7] As a well keepeth fresh her waters,
|    She keepeth her wickedness fresh;
|  Within her are rapine and violence heard,
|    Sickness and wounds are for ever before Me.
|  [6:8] O Jerusalem, be admonished,
|    Lest My soul from thee be severed,
|  Lest I make thee a desolation,
|    An unihabited land.
|  [6:9] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts;
|  "Glean like a vine full thoroughly
|    Those that are left of Israel;
|  Set thy hand once more
|    As a vintager unto the branches."
|  [6:10] "But to whom shall I speak and bear witness
|    In such wise that they listen?
|  For see! their ear is uncircumcised,
|    Helpless are they to hearken.
|  To them is the word of Jehovah
|    Become an utter scorn;
|    They have no pleasure in it.
|  [6:11] I am filled with the wrath of Jehovah,
|    I am weary of holding it back:
|  On the child in the street I will pour it,
|    On youths, too, where’er they assemble;
|  It shall smite men and women alike,
|    And the aged, whose days are many.
|  [6:12] Their homes shall be turned unto others,
|    Their fields and their wives together;
|  For against those that dwell in the land
|    I will stretch out My hand, saith Jehovah."

#### The National Materialism and its Doom ####

|  [6:13] For great and small alike,
|    They are all of them greedy of gain;
|  Prophet and priest alike–
|    Every man of them practiseth falsehood.
|  [6:14] They would heal the hurt of My people,
|    As though it were but slight;
|    "It is well, it is well," they say,
|    "When it is anything but well."
|  [6:15] Are they at all abashed
|    At their deeds abominable?
|  Nay, they are unabashed,
|    They know not how to blush.
|  They shall therefore fall with the fallen;
|    In the hour of their visitation
|    They shall stumble, saith Jehovah.
|  [6:16] Thus did Jehovah say:
|  Stand in the ways and see,
|    And ask for the ancient paths;
|  Mark that which leadeth to happiness,
|    See that ye walk therein–
|  And ye shall find rest to your souls.
|    But they said, " We refuse to walk in it."
|  [6:17] And over you I set watchmen.
|    Saying "Hark for the sound of the trumpet."
|    But they said, "We refuse to hearken."
|  [6:18] Wherefore hearken, ye nations, and hear, O earth,
|    Take knowledge of that which is coming.
|  [6:19] Behold, I will bring on this people
|    Disaster, the fruits of their backsliding;
|  For they heeded not My words,
|    My instruction they rejected.
|  [6:20] Of what avail to Me
|    Is the incense that cometh from Sheba,
|    And sweet cane from a distant land?
|  I accept not yout burnt-offerings,
|    Your sacrifice pleaseth Me not.
|  [6:21] Therefore, thus saith Jehovah: Behold,
|    I will set on the way of this people
|  Stones over which they may stumble,
|    And over them stumble they shall,
|  Fathers and sons together–
|    And neighbour and friend shall perish.
|  [6:22] Thus saith Jehovah, Behold!
|    A people doth come from the north land,
|  A mighty nation is stirring
|    At the uttermost ends of the earth
|  [6:23] Bow they wield and javelin–
|    Cruel and pitiless they,
|  With a voice like the roar of the sea,
|    And they ride upon horses and chariots,
|  Arrayed, like one man, for the battle,
|    Against thee, O daughter of Zion.
|  [6:24] The rumour thereof we have heard,
|    And all unnerved are we:
|  Anguish hath seized upon us,
|    And pangs as of women in travail.
|  [6:25] Venture not forth to the open,
|    Go not abroad on the highway;
|  For there is the sword of the enemy–
|    Terror on every side.
|  [6:26] O daughter of My people,
|  Gird thee about with sackcloth
|    And sprinkle thee with ashes;
|  Make mourning and bitter lament,
|    As for an only son;
|  For suddenly shall come
|    The Devastator upon us.

#### Jeremiah as Assayer of the National Character ####

|  [6:27] I have set thee to test My people,
|    To discover and test their way.
|  [6:28] Refractory are the all,
|    They slander as they go;
|  They are all of them brass amd iron,
|    They are all of them corrupt.
|  [6:29] Fiercely the bellows blow,
|    The lead is consumed by the fire;
|  But in vain doth the smelter keep smelting,
|    The dross is not smelted away.
|  [6:30] Their name shall be refuse silver,
|    For them hath Jehovah as refuse rejected.

##### Messages from the Middle Period of Jeremiah’s Career #####

#### Salvation lies neither in Temple nor Ritual, but only in Repentance and Reform ####

 [Jeremiah 7] 

[7:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah:[7:2] Take thy stand at the gate of the Temple, and theremake the following proclamation. Say, Listen tothis message from Jehovah, all ye men of Judah that[7:3] enter these gates to worship Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your waysand your doings, and I will guarantee this place as your[7:4] permanent home. But put no trust in lying messen-gers, who say: "This is the Temple of Jehovah, the[7:5] Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah." For ifyou really amend your ways and your doings: ifyou really do justice as between man and man;[7:6] if you abstain from the oppression of the residentalien, the fatherless and the widow, from the shed-ding of innocent blood in this place, and from devotion[7:7] to other gods to your own hurt, then I will guaranteeyou a home here for all time in the land that I gaveyour forefathers.

[7:8] But see, you are putting your trust in doctrines that[7:9] are as profitless as they are false. What! you committheft, murder, adultery, perjury, you burn sacrificeto the Baal, you run after other gods that are[7:10] strange to you; and then you (have the hardihoodto) come and stand before me in this House which iscalled by My name, and say, "Now we are safe" – inorder, forsooth, to carry on all these abominations.[7:11] This House which bears My name you regard, do you,as nothing but a robbers’ cave? Make no mistake:I – saith Jehovah – I have not been blind to all this.

[7:12] I would ask you to visit My sanctuary in Shiloh,where I put My name at the first, and see what thewickedness of My people Israel constrained Me to do[7:13] to it. And so it will be now, saith Jehovah. Becauseyou have perpetrated all these anormities, in defianceof My most earnest and repeated words, and have[7:14] refused to respond to My call, therefore this Templein which you repose your trust – called by My namethough it be – and the place that I gave to you andyour forefathers, I will consign to the same fate as[7:15] overtook Shiloh; and I will hurl you out of My sightas I have hurled your brethren, the whole race ofEphraim.

[7:16] As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raiseno cry or prayer on their behalf, and make no inter-[7:17] cession to Me, for I will not listen to thee. Seest thounot what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in[7:18] the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood,the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough,to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pourout drink-offerings to other gods, in order to vex Me.[7:19] Is it I, then, saith Jehovah, whom they are vexing?is it not rather themselves, doomed as they are to[7:20] bring confusion upon their own faces/. Therefore,thus saith the Lord Jehovah, "My anger and Myfury shall be poured out upon this place, upon manand beast, upon trees of the field and fruit of the ground,and it shall blaze in unquenchable flame."

[7:21] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel,Put the flesh of your burnt-offerings and your(other) sacrifices together, and make a common meal[7:22] of them both alike; for on the day that I brought yourforefathers out of the land of Egypt, I gave them nocommandment nor did I utter a syllable with regard to[7:23] burnt offering or sacrifice. But the commandment Igave them was this: Listen, I said, to My voice, andthen I will be your God and you shall be My people,and take My commandments as the standard of all[7:24] your life – this is the way to prosperity. But, insteadof inclining their ear and listening, they followed thedictates of their own stubborn and wicked hearts; they[7:25] went backwards instead of forwards. Ever since yourforefathers came out of the land of Egypt, every day upto this very day I have been sending you early and late[7:26] all My servants the prophets. Instead, however,of inclining their ear, they stiffened their necks andbehaved worse than their forefathers.

[7:27] This, then, is the message thou art to address tothem, though they will not listen to thee, nor respond[7:28] to thy call – thy message is to be this:

|  This is the folk that refused to listen
|    To the voice of Jehovah their God–
|    That refused to accept correction.
|  Sincerity is vanished,
|    It is found on their lips no more.

#### The Fearful Judgment upon Idolatry ####

|  [7:29] Shear off thy locks – away with them–
|    Lift up a dirge on the heights:
|  For Jehovah hath spurned and forsaken
|    The race that hath roused Him to anger.

[7:30] The people of Judah, saith Jehovah, have done thething I abhor: the very House that bears My namethey have defiled by introducing into it their abomin-[7:31] able worship. They have built a sanctuary of Tophethin the Valley of the son of Hinnom, for the burning oftheir sons and daughters in the fire, though this wasno commandment of Mine – such a thing never enteredinto My mind.

[7:32] Mark this therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah,when it shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valleyof the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, andTopheth shall be used as a burial-place for want of[7:33] room (elsewhere). The dead bodies of this peopleshall be devoured by the birds of the air and the beasts[7:34] of the earth, and none shall scare them away. In thecities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem I willstill the voice of mirth and gladness, and the voice ofbridegroom and bride; for the land shall become a waste.

 [Jeremiah 8] 

[8:1] At the time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out oftheir graves the bones of the kings, the princes, thepriests, and the prophets, of Judah, and of the in-[8:2] habitants of Jerusalem, and they shall spread thembefore the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven,whom they loved and served and followed and soughtand worshipped; and they shall remain ungatheredand unburried, they shall be for dung on the face of the[8:3] ground. And in all places to which I have driven them,every man that is left of this evil family would chooserather death than life, saith Jehovah of Hosts.

#### The National Refusal to Repent and the Coming Retribution ####

|  [8:4] Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Doth not one who has fallen rise up again,
|    And one who hath wandered turn back again?
|  [8:5] Why, then, doth thy people keep turning
|    For ever and ever backward,
|  Clinging to ways deceitful,
|    Refusing to return?
|  [8:6] I have listened with ear intent–
|    And their words are utterly false.
|  Not a man repents of his wickedness
|    Or thinks upon what he has done:
|  But each rushes on in his course
|    As a war-horse rushes in battle.
|  [8:7] The very stork in the heavens
|    Doth know her appointed seasons;
|  The turtle, the swift, and the swallow,
|    Observe the time of their coming:
|  But the ordinance of Jehovah
|    My people doth not know.
|  [8:8] How can ye say, "We are wise,
|    And with us is the law of Jehovah"?
|  For see! the false pen of the sribes
|    Hath turned it into a falsehood.
|  [8:9] So the wise shall be put to shame,
|    Be dismayed and taken captive.
|  They have spurned the word of Jehovah–
|    What manner of wisdom have they?
|  [8:10] So their wives I will give unto others,
|    To conquerors their fields.
|  For, great and small alike,
|    They are all of them greedy of gain;
|  Prophet and priest alike–
|    Every man of them practiseth falsehood.
|  [8:11] They would heal the hurt of My people
|    As though it were but slight;
|    "It is well, it is well," they say,
|    "When it is anything but well."
|  [8:12] Are they at all abashed
|    At their deeds abominable?
|  Nay, they are unabashed,
|    They know not how to blush.
|  They shall therefore fall with the fallen;
|    In the hour of their visitation
|    They shall stumble, saith Jehovah.
|  [8:13] When I, saith Jehovah, would gather their fruit,
|    There is not a grape on the vine;
|  There is not a fig on the fig-tree,
|    All withered are the leaves.
|  [8:14] "Why are we sitting still?
|    Assemble yourselves together,
|  Let us enter the fortified cities,
|    And there let us meet our doom;
|  For Jehovah our God hath doomed us,
|    Hath given us gall to drink,
|    Because we have sinned against Him.
|  [8:15] We wait for peace, but no good cometh;
|    For a season of healing, but lo! dismay."
|  [8:16] From Dan is heard the snort of his steeds,
|  At the sound of his stallions neighing
|    All the land doth tremble.
|  They come and devour the land
|    And all that is therein,
|    The city and her inhabitants.
|  [8:17] For see! I will send amongst you
|    serpents of basilik order,
|  Which cannot be charmed at all;
|    And they, saith Jehovah, shall bite you.

#### Jeremiah’s Lament over the Sin and the Doom of his people ####

|  [8:18] Past healing is my sorrow,
|    My heart is heavy within me.
|  [8:19] Hark! a voice is calling
|    From the daughter of my people
|    From a land that is far away:
|  "Is not Jehovah in Zion?
|    Is not her King therein?"
|  "With their images why have they vexed Me–
|    With futile foreign gods?"
|  [8:20] "The harvest is past, the summer is ended,
|    And all unsaved are we."
|  [8:21] For the daughter of my people,
|    All broken, mine own heart is broken;
|  I go about in mourning,
|    With the clutch of horror upon me.
|  [8:22] Is there no balm in Gilead?
|    Is there no physician there?
|  Why cometh then no healing
|    To the daughter of my people?

 [Jeremiah 9] 

|  [9:1] O that my head were waters,
|    And mine eyes a fountain of tears,
|  That day and night I might weep
|    For the slain of the daughter of my people!
|  [9:2] O that I had in the desert
|    A spot such as travellers lodge in;
|  For then would I leave my people,
|    Yea, from them I would go;
|  For they be all adulterers,
|    A company of traitors,
|    That bend their tongue like a bow.
|  [9:3] It is not the true, but the false,
|    That has mastery in the land;
|  For they pass from evil to evil,
|    And they know not Me, saith Jehovah.
|  [9:4] Let each man beware of his neighbour,
|    And trust not any brother:
|  For brothers are tricksters, all of them,
|    And neighbours are slanderers all.
|  [9:5] They all deceive one another,
|    The truth they will not speak;
|  They have taught their tongue to lie,
|    They behave like knaves and fools.
|  [9:6] Oppression upon oppression,
|    Deceit upon deceit:
|    They refuse, saith Jehovah, to know Me.
|  [9:7] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    Behold I will smelt them and test them,
|  For alas! I must turn Mine eyes away
|    From the daughter of My people.
|  [9:8] Their tongue is a deadly arrow,
|    The words of their mouth are deceit;
|  They speak their neighbour fair,
|    But at heart they are laying a trap for him.
|  [9:9] And crimes like these, saith Jehovah,
|    Am I to leave unpunished?
|  Shall not My soul be avenged
|    On a nation such as this?
|  [9:10] Lift a lament for the mountains,
|    A dirge for the wilderness pastures;
|  For wasted they lie and untraversed,
|    No lowing of cattle they hear:
|  The birds of the air and the beasts
|    Are fled away and gone.
|  [9:11] I will make of Jerusalem ruins,
|    A place for jackals to haunt;
|  I will make of the cities of judah
|    An uninhabited waste.
|  [9:12] Where is the man that Jehovah
|    Himself hath communed with and charged
|  To declare why the land us a ruin,
|    Laid waste like the untravelled wilderness?
|  [9:13] And Jehovah said unto me:
|  Because they forsook My law
|    Which I had set before them,
|  And did not live thereby,
|    But disobeyed My voice,
|  [9:14] And followed their stubborn hearts,
|    And the Baals that their fathers had taught them:
|  [9:15] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    The God of Israel; Behold,
|  I will feed this people with wormwood,
|    And give them gall to drink.
|  [9:16] I will scatter them far among nations
|    To them and their fathers unknown;
|  The sword I will send to pursue them,
|    Until I have clean consumed them.
|  [9:17] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|  Now mark ye well and summon
|    The women that chant in dirges;
|  And send for the skillful women,
|    That they may come in haste,
|    [9:18] And lift up for us a lament;
|  That our eyes may run with tears,
|    And our eyelids gush with water.
|  [9:19] Hark! from Zion float sounds of wailing,
|    "Alas!how are we spoiled;
|  We are put to utter shame,
|    Because we have left the land,
|    And our homes are hurled to the ground."
|  [9:20] Hear then, ye women, the word of Jehovah,
|    Received with your ears the word of His mouth,
|  And teach this lament to your daughters,
|    Each one to her neighbour this dirge:
|  [9:21] "Death hath climbed up to our windows,
|    And into our palaces entered,
|  sweeping the child from the streets
|    And the youth from the broad open spaces.
|  [9:22] The corpses of men are fallen
|    Like dung on the face of the field;
|  Or like sheaves behind the reaper,
|    With none to gather them up."

#### The True Glory of a Man ####

|  [9:23] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Let the wise man not boast of his wisdom,
|    Let the strong man not boast of his strength;
|  Let the rich man not boast of his riches,

[9:24] But in this be the boaster’s boast–
|    In insight and knowledge of Me
|    As Jehovah, who over the earth

|  Doeth kindness and justice and right;
|    For these are the things that I love.

#### The Necessity for Circumcision of Heart ####

[9:25] Mark this well, saith Jehovah: days are comingwhen I will punish all those that, though circumcised[9:26] (in flesh) are uncircumcised (in heart) – Egypt, Judah,Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all those denizens of thewilderness that have the corners of their hair clipped;for while all the nations are uncircumcised, the wholehousehold of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.

#### The Approaching Doom of Exile ####

 [Jeremiah 10] 

|  [10:17] Take up thy pack from the ground,
|    (O Jerusalem), that sittest beleaguered.
|  [10:18] For thus saith Jehovah, Behold,
|  This time I will surely sling out
|    The inhabitants of the land,
|  And bring them into such straits
|    That they shall melt for fear.
|  [10:19] Ah! woe is me! I am broken,
|    And smitten very sore,
|  "Yes, this is a stroke indeed,"
|    Said I, "and I must bear it.
|  [10:20] My tent is despoiled and perished,
|    And all my cords are broken;
|    My flock is vanished clean.
|  There is none to stretch my tent,
|    Or to hang up my curtains more.
|  [10:21] For the shepherds are foolish grown,
|    And nothing they care for Jehovah;
|  For this cause they have not prospered,
|    And all their flock is scattered.
|  [10:22] Hark! a rumour! behold, it cometh,
|    A mighty uproar from the land of the north,
|  It shall make of the cities of Judah a waste,
|    A place to be haunted of jackals.

#### Prayer that Judgment may be Tempered with Mercy ####

|  [10:23] Well, O Jehovah, I know
|    That a man’s way lies not with himself;`
|  It is not in the power of man
|    To walk and direct his steps.
|  [10:24] When therefore Thou chastenest us,
|    Do Thou deal, O Jehovah, in measure,
|  And not in Thine indignation;
|    For so wouldst Thou bring us to nothing.
|  [10:25] Pour out Thy wrath on the heathen,
|    That have not cared for Thee–
|    And on tribes that invoke not Thy name;
|  For Jacob they have devoured,
|    They have desolated his dwelling.

#### The Folly of Fearing the Impotent and Unreal Gods of the Heathen ####

 [Jeremiah 10] 

|  [10:1] Listen, O household of Israel, to the word which Jehovah
|    [10:2] hath spoken to you. Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Learn not the ways of the heathen,
|    And be not dismayed at the signs in the sky,
|  As the heathen are dismayed;

[10:3] For heathen religion is vapour.

|  A tree is cut down in the forest
|    And fashioned by craftsman’s axe,
|  [10:4a] Adorned with silver and gold–

[10:9] With silver beat fine, brought from Tarshish,

|  And gold that cometh form Ophir–
|    And wrought by the craftsman and goldsmith,
|  And robed in blue and in purple–
|    The work of skilled men are they all–
|  [10:4b] And fastened with nails and hammers,
|    To keep them from toppling over.
|  [10:5] They are altogether dumb,
|    Like a scarecrow in garden of cucumbers;
|  Carried they must needs be,
|    For they cannot go of themselves.
|  Be not afraid of them, then,
|    For they have it not in their power
|    To do either good or harm.
|  [10:6] There is none like Thee, O Jehovah;
|    Thou art great, and great is Thy name in might.
|  [10:7] Who should not fear Thee, O King of the nations?
|    For Thee it becometh well;
|  For among the wise men of the nations all,
|    And among their kingdoms all,
|    There is none that is like unto Thee.
|  [10:8] One and all, they are senseless and silly,
|    Instructed of gods that are wooden.
|  [10:10] But Jehovah is God indeed,
|    A living God, and a King everlasting;
|  The earth at His wrath doth tremble,
|    His anger no nation can bear.
|  [10:12] He created the earth by His power,
|    He established the world by His wisdom,
|    He stretched out the heavens by His skill.
|  [10:13] When He uttereth His voice,
|    The waters roar in the heavens,
|  And He causeth vapour to rise
|    From the uttermost ends of the earth.
|  Lightnings He made for the rain,
|    And the wind He brings out of His storehouses.
|  [10:14] How foolish is man with his knowledge!
|    The goldsmith is shamed by his image;
|  His idols are delusion,
|  [10:15] They are an empty mockery,
|    In the hour of their trial they shall perish.
|  [10:16] Not such is the Portion of Jacob,
|    His God is the Framer of all things:
|    Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

#### Jeremiah Exhorts the People to be True to the Demands of the Deuteronomic Law ####

 [Jeremiah 11] 

[11:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah.

[11:2] "Listen to the words of this covenant, and declarethem to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of[11:3] Jerusalem. Say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the Godof Israel: Accursed be the man that refuses to listen[11:4] to the words of the covenant with which I charged yourforefathers on the day that I brought them out of thatiron furnace, the land of Egypt. I promised them thenthat, if they obeyed My voice, and conformed to allMy commandments, they should be My people and I[11:5] would be their God, and thus the oath would be estab-lished that swore to their forefathers – to give thema land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."Then I answered and said, "Amen, Jehovah."

[11:6] Jehovah then said to me, "Make this proclamationthroughout the cities of Judah and in the streets ofJerusalem: Listen to the words of this covenant and[11:7] act upon them. For early and late, ever since the daythat I brought your forefathers out of the land ofEgypt up to this day, I have been earnestly adjuring[11:8] them to listen to My voice; but instead of obedientlyinclining their ear, every man of them followed thedictates of his own wicked and stubborn heart; so Ibrought upon them all the threats of this covenantwhich I had charged them to observe, but which theyfailed to observe."

[11:9] Further Jehovah said to me, "The people of Judahand the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been engaged in[11:10] a manifest conspiracy (against Me). They havereverted to the sins of their forefathers who refused tolisten to My words, and they are actually indulging inthe worship of other gods: the households of Israeland Judah alike have broken the covenant I made with[11:11] their forefathers. Therefore thus saith Jehovah:Mark this – I will bring upon them a disaster which theyshall be powerless to escape; and when they cry to Me, U[11:12] will turn a deaf ear. Then the cities of Judah and theinhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods towhom they burn sacrifice; but no help shall they get[11:13] from them in the day of their calamity: for your gods,O Judah, are as numerous as your cities; and asnumerous as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars youhave set up for sacrifice in the scandalous worshipof the Baal.

[11:14] As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raiseno cry or prayer on their behalf; for I will not listedwhen they call to Me in the day of their calamity.

|  [11:15] What business hath My Beloved
|    In My house, after conduct so vile?
|  Shall vows and the sacred flesh
|    Avert from thee thy doom
|    Then mightest thou rejoice.
|  [11:16] A spreading, graceful olive
|    Jehovah had called thy name;
|  But to the roar of a mighty storm
|    He hath set it ablaze with lightning,
|    And the branches thereof are marred.

[11:17] For Jehovah of Hosts that planted thee hath pro-nounced evil against thee in requital for th evil in whichthe households of Israel and Judah have vexatiouslyindulged, by burning sacrifice to the Baal."

#### A Plot against Jeremiah’s Life ####

##### The plot #####

|  [11:18] I knew – for Jehovah had told me,
|    And revealed to me what they were doing:
|  [11:19] But I – like an innocent lamb
|    That is led to the slaughter was I.
|  Yea, all unconscious was I
|    Of the plots they were plotting against me–
|    To ruin the tree with its sap,
|  From the land of the living to root me
|    And banish my name out of mind.
|  [11:20] But Jehovah of Hosts, Thou righteous Judge,
|    Who mind and heart dost prove,
|  Let me see Thy vengeance upon them,
|    For on Thee have I rolled my cause.
|  [11:21] Therefore, thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of
|  Anathoth who seek thy life and threaten thee with
|  death at their hands, if thou preach in the name of
|  Jehovah:
|  [11:22] Therefore saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    Behold I will visit them sternly;
|  Their young men shall die by the sword,
|    Their sons and their daughters shall perish with hunger.
|  [11:23] Not one of them shall be left;
|    For over the men of Anathoth
|  Calamity I will bring
|    In the year of their visitation.

##### Jeremiah’s Persplexity and Prayer for Vengeance #####

 [Jeremiah 12] 

|  [12:1] "Righteous art thou, O Jehovah,
|    when I make my plaint unto Thee;
|    Yet the case I would reason with Thee.
|  Why do the wicked prosper?
|    And why do the faithless all flourish?
|  [12:2] Thou plantest them, yea, they take root;
|    They spread, yea, they bring forth fruit.
|  You are always on their lips,
|    But far, far away from their hearts.
|  [12:3] But Thou, O Jehovah, dost know me,
|    My heart towards Thee Thou hast proved.
|  Pull them out, then, like sheep for the slaughter,
|    To the day of slaughter devote them.
|  [12:4] How long must the land still mourn,
|    And the herbs of the fields be all withered?
|  Beast and bid are vanished,
|    Because of the sin of her people,
|    Who think God is blind to their ways."

##### The Divine Answer #####

|  [12:5] "If thy race with the footmen hath wearied thee,
|    How wilt thou vie with the horse?
|  If thou takest to flight in a land that is safe,
|    Then how wilt thou do on the jungle of Jordan?
|  [12:6] For thy father’s household, thine own very brethren,
|    Even they have played thee false.
|  They pursue thee with clamours loud:
|    Trust them not, when they speak thee fair."

#### Lament over the Havoc wrought upon Judah by her Neighbours ####

##### The Havoc #####

|  [12:7] My house I have forsaken,
|    My heritage I have cast off;
|  Into the hands of her foes
|    I have given the Beloved of My soul.
|  [12:8] My darling is grown to Me (fierce)
|    As a lion in the jungle;
|  She hath lifted her voice against Me,
|    And therefore I abhor her.
|  [12:9] Is My darling a speckled bird,
|    That the birds circle round and assail her?
|  Come, all ye beasts of the field,
|    Come hither to devour.
|  [12:10] Shepherds many have ruined My vineyard,
|    And trampled My ground under foot;
|  They have turned My pleasant inheritance
|    Into a desolate wilderness.
|  [12:11] They have made it a desolation,
|    It mourneth, ah me! all desolate.
|  Desolate all is the land,
|    But no one cares.
|  [12:12] Upon all the bare heights in the wilderness
|    Spoilers have descended;
|  For the sword of Jehovah devours
|    From one end of the land to another;
|    No peace is there for any.
|  [12:13] Wheat they have sown, but thorns they have reaped;
|    Their labour hath profited nothing;
|  Their harvest shall bring them to shame,
|    Because of Jehovah’s hot anger.
|  [12:14] This is the word of Jehovah,
|    To all Mine evil neighbours
|  That put forth a hand on the heritage
|    I gave to My people Israel.
|  Behold! I will pluck them away from their land,
|    And the household of Judah I pluck from the midst of them;
|  [12:15] But when thus I have plucked them away,
|    I will once more take pity upon them,
|  And bring each man back to his heritage,
|    Each to his own land again.
|  [12:16] And if ever they master the ways of My people,
|    To swear by My name, "As Jehovah liveth,"
|  As they once taught My people to swear by the Baal,
|    They shall then be built up in the midst of My people.
|  [12:17] But the nation that will not listen,
|    I will pluck clean away and destroy, saith Jehovah.

#### The Parable of the Waistcloth ####

 [Jeremiah 13] 

[13:1] Jehovah told me to go and buy a linen waistcloth andput it on my loins, taking care not to let it get into[13:2] water. So I bought a waistcloth, as Jehovah hadbidden me, and I put it on my loins.

[13:3] Then a second message from Jehovah came to me,[13:4] telling me to take the waistcloth I had bought, thatwas on my loins, and to proceed to Parah and bury it[13:5] there in a chink of the rock. So I went and burried it[13:6] at Parah, as Jehovah had charged me. Many daysafter, Jehovah told me to proceed to Parah and removethe waistcloth which He had charged me to bury there.[13:7] Then I went to Parah and dug out and took the linenwaistcloth from the place where I had buried it; andlo! the waistcloth was ruined – it was good fornothing.

[13:8] Then there came to me this word from Jehovah:[13:9] Thus saith Jehovah, Ruin like this I will bring upon the[13:10] soaring pride of Judah and Jerusalem. As for thesedepraved people who, refusing to listen to My words,follow the dictates of their own stubborn hearts andindulge in the worship and service of other gods – letthem become like this waistcloth, good for nothing.[13:11] For, as the waistcloth clings to a man’s loins, so wouldI have had the whole household of Israel and Judahcling unto Me, saith Jehovah, to be My people, asource of renown and praise and glory: but they wouldnot listen.

#### The Parable of the Jars ####

[13:12] Take to them therefore this message: Thus saithJehovah the God of Israel, "Every jar must be filled withwine." And if they say to thee, "Why, of course we[13:13] know that every jar must be filled with wine," then thisis what thou shalt say to them: Thus saith Jehovah:Soon-mark it well-I will fill with drunkenness allthe inhabitants of this land – the kings that sit uponthe throne of David, the priests, the prophets, and all[13:14] the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will dash them,saith Jehovah, one against another, fathers and sonstogether. I will neither spare nor pity: no compassionshall restrain Me from destroying them.

#### The Tender Solemn Warning ####

|  [13:15] O hear and give ear, be not haughty;
|    Jehovah hath spoken.
|  [13:16] To Jehovah your God give ye glory,
|    Before it grows dark,
|  And ere yet, on the mountains of twilight,
|    With feet that are stumbling,
|  Ye look for the light, which to gloom
|    And thick darkness He turneth.
|  [13:17] But should ye refuse to give heed,
|  Then in secret my soul shall weep,
|    Because of your pride:
|  And with tears that flow ever and ever
|    Mine eyes shall run down
|  For the flock of Jehovah, afar
|    To captivity taken.

#### Lament on the Approaching Fate of King Jehoiachin and the Queen Mother ####

|  [13:18] Say to the King and the Queen Mother,
|    Low ye be seated;
|  For down from your head hath been hurled
|    Your glorious crown.
|  [13:19] The towns in the south land are shut,
|    There is no one to open them;
|  All Judah is swept into exile,
|    Swept all into exile.

#### Lament over the Sin and the Doom of Jerusalem ####

|  [13:20] Jerusalem, lift up thine eyes and behold
|    How they come from the north.
|  Where is thy beautiful flock,
|    Even the sheep that were given thee?
|  [13:21] What wilt thou say when He calleth–
|    To lord over thee–
|  The men thou thyself didst instruct
|    To approach thee as lovers?
|  Shall anguish not clutch at thee hard
|    As of woman in travail?
|  [13:22] But if in thy heart thou shouldst say,
|    "Why is this come upon me?"
|  Thy manifold guilt is the cause
|    That thy skirts are stripped off
|    And thy modesty outraged.
|  [13:23] Can the African change his skin,
|    Or the leopard his spots?
|  Just as helpless art thou to do good
|    That art wont to do evil.
|  [13:24] And so to the winds of the desert
|    Like stubble that flies I will scatter them.
|  [13:25] This is thy lot, this the portion
|    I measure to thee, saith Jehovah;
|  Because thou forgattest Me,
|    And hast trusted in falsehood.
|  [13:26] Thy skirt I Myself will lift over thy face,
|    That thy shame may be seen.
|  [13:27] Thine adulteries and thy neighings,
|    Thy harlotry foul–
|  In the field, on the hills, I have seen–
|    Thy detestable doings.
|  Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem!
|  How long time yet must pass
|    Until thou be cleansed?

#### A Grievous Drought and the Thoughts it Awakened in the Prophet ####

##### The Distress of the Drought #####

 [Jeremiah 14] 

|  [14:1] The message which came from Jehovah to Jeremiah
|    with regard to the drought.
|  [14:2] Judah doth mourn, and the gates thereof languish;
|    (Her people) are sitting in black on the ground,
|    And a cry rises up from Jerusalem.
|  [14:3] Her nobles have sent their attendants for water;
|    They come to the cisterns, no water they find:
|  Back then they go with their pitches empty,
|    In shame and confusion they cover their heads.
|  [14:4] Dismayed are the men that till the ground,
|    Because on the land no rain hath fallen;
|    The ploughmen cover their heads in confusion.
|  [14:5] Yea, even the hind in the field forsaketh
|    The young that she bore, because grass there is none.
|  [14:6] And the wild asses stand on the bleak bare heights,
|    Panting for air, like the crocodile,
|  And the light dieth out of their eyes,
|    Because herbage there is none.

##### The Prophet’s Supplication #####

|  [14:7] And yet though our sins rise in witness against us,
|    Jehovah, O act, for Thine own name’s sake;
|  For many a time have we turned from Thee back,
|    And against Thee we have sinned.
|  [14:8] O Thou that art Israel’s Hope,
|    Her Saviour in time of trouble,
|  Why like a stranger art Thou in Thy land,
|    Like a traveller who turneth to lodge but a night?
|  [14:9] Why shouldst Thou be like a man fast asleep,
|    Like a warrior powerless to save?
|  Yet Thou, O Jehovah, art here in our midst,
|    By thy name we are called: O leave us not.

##### The Divine Answer #####

|  [14:10] Touching this people Jehovah thus answered:
|  Thus do they love to wander
|    With unrestrained feet,
|    But Jehovah cannot accept them:
|  Their guilt He now calleth to mind,
|    Their sins He will visit with chastisement.
|  [14:11] And Jehovah said to me: Offer no prayer for the
|  [14:12] welfare of this people. When they fast, I will be deaf
|  to their cry; when they offer burnt-offerings and
|  cereal offerings, I will not accept them. By sword,
|  by famine, by pestilence, I will consume them.

##### The Prophet’s Remonstrance #####

[14:13] To this I made answer: Oh! Lord Jehovah, see!The prophets are ceaselessly telling them that they willnever see the sword or suffer from famine, but thatThou wilt bestow upon them stable peace in this place.

##### The Divine Answer #####

[14:14] Then Jehovah said to me: The prophets are butpreaching lies in My name. I never sent them; theyhave no commission from Me; not a word have Ispoken to them. What thy preach to you is nothingbut a tissue of lying visions and idle divinations and[14:15] inventions of their own deceitful hearts. This there-fore is the message of Jehovah concerning thoseprophets who, without any commision from Me, areceaselessly preaching that this land will never sufferfrom sword or famine: by sword and famine shall[14:16] those very prophets themselves be consumed, and thepeople they preach to shall be flung out in the streetsof Jerusalem as victims of sword and famine, and theyshall lie unburied – themselves, their wives, their sons,their daughters; for I will pour their wickedness overthem.

##### The Prophet’s Lament and Confession #####

[14:17] This is the word thou shalt speak to them:

|  Mine eyes run down with tears
|    By night and day unceasing;
|  For the daughters of my people
|    Is broken, grievously broken,
|    With a wound exceeding sore.
|  [14:18] If to the field I go forth,
|    Lo, the slain of the sword lie there;
|  And if into the city I go,
|    Lo, there lie the victims of famine:
|  Yea, prophet and priest alike,
|    All wiltless, lie crouched on the ground,
|  [14:19] Hast Thou utterly cast away Judah?
|    Is Zion grown loathsome to Thee?
|  Why hast Thou smitten us so,
|    That we can find no healing?
|  We look for peace, but no good cometh:
|    For a season of healing, but lo! dismay.
|  [14:20] We acknowledge, Jehovah, our wickedness,
|    The guilt of our fathers also;
|    For we have sinned against Thee.
|  [14:21] For Thy name’s sake, O spurn us not,
|    O shame not Thy glorious throne:
|    O remember and break out Thy covenant with us.
|  [14:22] Of the worthless gods of the heathen
|    Is there one that can bring down rain?
|    Can the sky give showers of itself?
|  Is it not Thou alone that canst do this–
|    Jehovah, our God, whom we wait for?
|    Yea, these things are all Thy creation.

##### The Divine Answer – Rejection and Doom #####

 [Jeremiah 15] 

|  [15:1] Then Jehovah said to me:
|  Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me,
|  Yet no learning of heart could I have for this people;
|    Away with them out of My sight – let them go.
|  [15:2] When they ask thee where they shall go,
|    Then say to them, Thus saith Jehovah:
|  To death, those destined to death;
|    To the sword, those doomed to the sword;
|  To famine, those destined to famine,
|    To exile, those destined to exile.
|  [15:3] And I, saith Jehovah, will set over them four kinds
|  (of destroyers) – the sword to slay, the dogs to tear,
|  the birds of the air to devour, and the beasts of the
|  [15:4] earth to destroy; and I will make them an object of
|  Consternation to every kingdom in the world, in return
|  for all the evil wrought in Jerusalem by Manasseh,
|  the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
|  [15:5] O Jerusalem, who will then pity thee?
|    Who will commiserate thee?
|  Who will go out of his way
|    To enquire how it fareth with thee?
|  [15:6] Thou hast cast Me off, saith Jehovah,
|    Thou ever wentest backward;
|  So, weary at length of relenting,
|    I stretch out My hand to destroy thee.
|  [15:7] With winnowing-fork I will winnow thee,
|    In every gate of the land.
|  I will make My people childless,
|    And destroy them because of their wickedness,
|  [15:8c] A destroyer I will bring
|    Upon mother and suckling at noon-day;
|  I will bring of a sudden upon her
|    Agitation and dismay.
|  [15:9] The mother of seven shall languish,
|    And she shall swoon away;
|  Her sun shall go down in the day-time,
|    Ashamed and abashed shall she be.
|  [15:8a] Their widows are more in number
|    [15:b] Than the sand of all the seas,
|  [15:9e] And the rest of them I will deliver
|    [15:f] To the sword in the face of their foes.

##### The Prophet’s Passionate Lament #####

|  [15:10] Alas for me! mother of mine, that bore me
|    To strive and to struggle with all the world.
|  Never lender nor borrower was I,
|    Yet one and all they curse me.
|  [15:11] To their curses be "Amen, Jehovah,"
|    If ever I failed to entreat Thee
|  For a blessing upon my foes
|    In their time of distress and disaster.
|  [15:12] Is the arm in my shoulder of iron?
|    Or is my brow of brass?
|  [15:15] O Jehovah, remember and visit me,
|    Avenge me of my tormentors;
|  Let not Thine anger tarry.
|    Bethink Thee – it is in Thy cause
|  That I have been laden with insult.

[15:16] They spurn Thy words – every man of them.

|  But to me is Thy word a delight,
|    The very joy of my heart;
|  For I have been called by Thy name,
|    O Jehovah, Thou God of Hosts.
|  [15:17] No happy seat was mine
|    At gatherings of the merry;
|  But lonely I sat, for Thy hand was upon me:
|    With (holy) wrath Thou hast filled me.
|  [15:18] Oh why is my pain unceasing?
|    And why is this wound of mine cureless?
|  Like a treacherous brook wilt Thou be unto me,
|    Like waters that are unsure?

##### The Divine Answer #####

|  [15:19] Thus therefore saith Jehovah:
|  If thou turn again, I will restore thee,
|    And thou shalt be My servant.
|  Let thy speech but be noble, not petty,
|    And so thou shalt be My mouthpiece;
|  They then may turn unto thee,
|    But thou shalt not turn unto them.
|  [15:20] And unto this folk I will make thee
|    A fortified wall of bronze.
|  They will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor;
|    For I will be with thee to save thee,
|    And rescue thee – thus saith Jehovah.
|  [15:21] Yes, I from the land of the wicked will rescue thee,
|    I from the clutch of the cruel will redeem thee.

#### Predictions of Coming Disaster ####

##### The Prophet’s Unutterable Loneliness #####

 [Jeremiah 16] 

|  [16:1] There came to me this message from Jehovah:
|  [16:2] Thou shalt not take thee a wife,
|    Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel;
|  Nor shalt thou have any sons
|    Or daughters in this place.
|  [16:3] For thus Jehovah saith
|    Concerning the sons and the daughters
|    That in this place are born,
|  And concerning the mothers that bore them,
|    And the fathers that begat them:
|  [16:4] "A grievous death shall they die,
|    Unburied, unlamented;
|  Like dung on the face of the field shall they be,
|    They shall perish by sword and famine;
|  By the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth
|    Shall their corpses be devoured."

##### The National Doom #####

|  [16:5] For thus Jehovah saith:
|    Do not enter the house of grief,
|  Nor go to make lament,
|    And raise for them no wailing;
|  Because from this (My) people
|    I have taken away My peace.
|  [16:6] Both great and small in this land shall die,
|    They shall be unburried, unmourned;
|  Not a man shall gash his body,
|    Or shear his hair for them.
|  [16:7] No bread shall be broken for mourners,
|    To comfort them for the dead;
|  Nor shall cup of consolation
|    Be given for father or mother.
|  [16:8] Do not enter the house of feasting,
|    To sit with them, eating and drinking.
|  [16:9] For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    The God of Israel:
|  Mark this – ye shall live to see it–
|    This place I will bring to silence,
|  The voice of mirth and gladness,
|    The voice of bridegroom and bride.

##### The Infidelity which Justifies the Doom #####

[16:10] After thou hast delivered this message to the people,they will ask thee why Jehovah has doomed them to allthis misery. "What is our guilt," they will say, "andwhat is the sin we have committed against Jehovah our[16:11] God?" Tell them then, "Jehovah doth solemnlydeclare: it is because your fathers abandoned Mefor the worship and the service of other gods; yes,[16:12] they abandoned Me and neglected My law. Andyour own behaviour has been worse than that of yourfathers. See how every man of you is following theimpulses of his own wicked and stubborn heart and[16:13] refusing to listen to Me. For this, then, I will hurl youout of this land into a land that is strange to you andyour fathers; and there, day and night, ye shall serveother gods; for no favour shall ye have from Me."

##### The Doom #####

|  [16:16] Behold, I will send many fishers,
|    And them they shall fish, saith Jehovah;
|  And then will I send many hunters,
|    And they shall hunt them down
|  From every mountain and hill
|    And out of the clefts of the rocks.
|  [16:17] For Mine eyes are all their ways,
|    From My face they are not concealed,
|    And their guilt is not hid from Mine eyes.
|  [16:18] I will therefore requite them double
|    For all their guilt and sin,
|  In profaning My land with the carcases
|    Of their detestable idols,
|  And filling Mine inheritance
|    With their abominations.
|  [16:21] See then! I wil give them to feel–
|    This once I will give them to feel–
|  The weight of My mighty hand:
|    And then shall they know that My name is Jehovah.

##### Ultimate Recognition by the Heathen of Jehovah as the True God #####

|  [16:19] O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold,
|    My refuge in time of trouble,
|  To Thee from the ends of the earth
|    Shall nations come and say,
|  "Only lies have our fathers inherited,
|    Empty and useless (idols)."
|  [16:20] Shall a man make gods for himself,
|    Which yet are no gods at all?

##### The Doom #####

 [Jeremiah 17] 

|  [17:1] The sin of Judah is written
|    With pencil of iron;
|  With diamond point it is graven
|    On the tablet of their heart,
|  On the horns of their altars,

[17:2] On every green tree,

|  On every high hill,

[17:3] On the heights in the field.

|  Thy substance and all thy treasures
|    As spoil I will give,
|  In requital for all the sins
|    That pervaded thy borders.
|  [17:4] And then thou shalt slack thy hold
|    Of the land that I gave thee:
|  I will make thee the slave of thy foes
|    In a land that is strange to thee;
|  For a fire in Mine anger is kindled
|    That burneth for ever.

#### The Joy and Wisdom of Trust ####

|  [17:5] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Accursed the man that trusteth in man,
|    And maketh flesh his arm,
|    While his heart is estranged from Jehovah.
|  [17:6] Like a bare desert shrub shall he be,
|    No destiny fair shall be his;
|  His home is the scorching wilderness,
|    A salt uninhabited land.
|  [17:7] But blessed the man that trusteth Jehovah,
|    That maketh Jehovah his confidence;
|  [17:8] Like a tree shall he be, by the waters planted,
|    That stretcheth its roots out towards the stream,
|  And is never afraid for the coming of heat,
|    But its leaves are for ever green–
|  In the year of drought untroubled–
|    And it yeildeth fruit without ceasing.
|  [17:11] Like a patridge that sitteth on eggs
|    That it hath not laid,
|  Is the man that getteth him riches
|    In ways unjust.
|  In the midst of his days he must leave them,
|    His end shall declare him a fool.
|  [17:12] A glorious throne, set on high from of old,
|    Is the site where standeth our holy place.
|  [17:13] O Jehovah, Thou Hope of Israel,
|    Put to shame shall all be that forsake Thee;
|  Yea, they that prove faithless to Thee
|    In the land shall be put to confussion;
|  Because they have forsaken
|    The Fountain of Living Water.

#### The Prophet’s Prayer ####

|  [17:9] "The heart is most treacherous of all things,
|    And sick beyond cure: who cah know it?"
|  [17:10] "I, Jehovah, am Searcher of hearts,
|    And Tester of thoughts am I,
|  To give each what his doings have earned,
|    To let each reap the fruit of his deeds."
|  [17:14] "Heal me, Jehovah, and I shall be healed;
|    Save me, and I shall be saved indeed:
|    For Thou art my Praise.
|  [17:15] Mark how they say to me ceaselessly
|    ’Where is the word of Jehovah?
|    Pray, now, let it come to pass.’
|  [17:16] Yet never for this did I urge Thee
|    To bring on the evil day,
|  Nor ever have longed in my heart
|    For the day of disaster – Thou knowest.
|  The words that came forth from my lips
|    Lie open before Thy face.
|  [17:17] O be not a terror to me,
|    Thou Refuge of mine in the day of evil.
|  [17:18] Confusion on them that torment me–
|    On them, but not on me:
|  Be dire dismay upon them–
|    On them, but not on me;
|  Bring the day of disaster upon them,
|    With two-fold destruction destroy them."

#### The Sanctity of the Sabbath ####

[17:19] Jehovah commanded me to go and take my stand atthe Benjamin gate, through which the kings of Judah[17:20] go in and out, and at all the gates of Jerusalem, andthere He charged me to address them as follows: "Yekings of Judah, and all ye citizens of Judah and[17:21] Jerusalem that pass through these gates, Thus saithJehovah: As ye value you lives, be very careful notto carry a burden or to bring anything of the kindthrough the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day;[17:22] also to carry no load out of your houses on theSabbath day, and to do no work of any kind, but to keepthe Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers.[17:23] But instead of obediently inclining their ear, theystiffened their neck; they would have nothing to[17:24] do with obedience or discipline. If you, however,will give earnest heed to Me, saith Jehovah, andrefrain from bringing loads through the city gates on theSabbath day, if you keep the Sabbath day holy and[17:25] abstain from work of every kind, then kings thatsit upon the throne of David shall enter the gates ofthis city riding on chariots and horses, accompaniedby their princes, the men of Judah, and the citizens ofJerusalem; and the city shall be inhabited for ever.[17:26] From the cities of Judah, the neighbourhood ofJerusalem, and the district of Benjamin, from the low-land, the hill country, and the south, men shall cometo the Temple with burnt-offerings and sacrifices,[17:27] oblations and frankincense, and praise-offerings. If,however, you refuse to give heed to Me and to keep theSabbath day holy by refraining from carrying burdensthrough the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,then I will kindle in her gates a fire unquenchable, thatshall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

#### The Lesson of the Potter and the Clay ####

 [Jeremiah 18] 

[18:1] Jeremiah received from Jehovah the message which[18:2] follows: "Rise and go down to the potter’s house–I have somewhat to say to thee, which I will com-[18:3] municate to thee there." So I went down to thepotter’s house: and there he was-engaged on a[18:4] piece of work at the wheel. Now, if the thing he wasmaking was spoiled in his hands, he would just shapethe material over again into another such vessel as hehad decided to make.

[18:5] Thereupon there flashed upon me this message from[18:6] Jehovah. "Cannot I," He said, "deal with you,O household of Israel, like this potter? You arein My hand just like the clay in the potter’s hand.[18:7] At one moment I may decide to pluck up or break[18:8] down and destroy some nation of kingdom; butif the nation whose fate I have decreed turn from itswickedness, then I relent and do not execute the doom[18:9] I had planned for it. At another moment I maydecide to build up or to plant some nation of kingdom;[18:10] but if its behaviour displeases Me, if it refuses to listento My voice, then I will retract the favours I hadintended to confer upon it.

[18:11] Now, therefore, make this announcement to the menof Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, Thus saithJehovah: Beware! I am shaping calamity for you, Iam fashioning plans for your discomfiture. Turn, then,every man of you, from your evil ways, and amend your[18:12] life and behaviour." But they will say, "No, thereis no hope of that: rather will we follow devices of ourown and yeild, every man of us, to the impulses of ourwicked and stubborn hearts."[18:13] Thus therefore saith Jehovah:

|  Ask any heathen man
|    If he ever heard aught like this?
|  An utterly horrible thing
|    Hath been wrought by the Virgin of Israel.
|  [18:14] Doth the white snow vanish from Sirion’s crags?
|    Do the rills that flow cold from the hills ever dry?
|  [18:15] Yet Me hath My people forgotten;
|    The gods that they worship are phantoms.
|  They have stumbled upon the way
|    Ordained for them of old,
|  And turned into bypaths
|    That never were truly laid.
|  [18:16] So their land shall be made a horror–
|    An everlasting scorn.
|  It shall fill every traveller with horror–
|    Thereat he will shake his head,
|  [18:17] I will scatter them like the sirocco
|    Before the face of their foes.
|  Not My face, but My back, will I show them,
|    In the day of their calamity.

#### Plots against Jeremiah ####

##### The Plots #####

|  [18:18] Then said they, "Come, let us forge
|    A plot against Jeremiah.
|  For the priests will not lack for instruction to offer,
|    Nor the wise men for counsel to render,
|    Nor the prophet for words to declare.
|  Come, with the tongue let us smite him,
|    Let us watch him in all that he says."

##### Jeremiah’s Prayer #####

|  [18:19] O Jehovah, give heed unto me,
|    And hearken to my contention.
|  [18:20] Shall evil be rendered for good
|    That a pit they have dug for my life?
|  Call to mind how I stood before Thee,
|    To utter a prayer for their welfare,
|    And to turn Thy fury from them.
|  [18:21] Abandon Thou therefore their children to famine,
|    Deliver them up to the sword;
|  Let their wives become childless widows,
|    Let their men be slain of death,
|    And their youths may the sword smite in battle.
|  [18:22] Let a cry ring out from their houses,
|    When swiftly Thou bringest the raiders upon them;
|  For a pit they have dug to take me,
|    And snares they have hid for my feet.
|  [18:23] For well, O Jehovah, Thou knowest
|    How they plotted against me to slay me.
|  O pardon not their guilt,
|    And blot not their sin from Thy sight.
|  Let them prostrate be hurled before Thee;
|    Deal Thou with them in the time of Thine anger.

#### The Lesson of the Broken Flask and its Consequences for Jeremiah ####

 [Jeremiah 19] 

##### The Breaking of the Flask Symbolical of the Shattering of the Nation #####

[19:1] Then Jehovah commanded me to go and buy apotter’s earthenware flask, and, accompanied by a few[19:2] elders of the people and a few priests, to proceedto the Valley of the son of Hinnom by the entry of thePotsherd gate, and there announce the message with[19:3] which He would charge me. And the message wasthis: "Listen, ye kings of Judah, and ye citizens ofJerusalem, to what Jehovah is about to say: Thussaith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Markthis well. I will soon bring such a catastrophe uponthis place as will make the ears of all who hear of it[19:4] tingle; because they have forsaken Me and de-nationalised this place by their burnt-offerings to othergods, strange alike to them and their forefathers;and the kings of Judah have filled this place with the[19:5] blood of innocent men. They have built Baalsanctuaries to burn their sons in the fire as offerings toBaal, though this was no commandment of Mine – such[19:6] a thing never entered into My mind. Mark this,therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah, when thisplace shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valleyof the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter;[19:7] and I will spill upon the ground the wisdom of Judahand Jerusalem in this place. I will lay them low bythe sword of their enemies and by the hands of thosethat seek their life: their dead bodies I will give to thebirds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour.[19:8] And I will make this city a horror and a scorn; allthat pass by her shall be filled with horror and with[19:9] scorn at all the blows that I shall rain upon her. Iwill drive them to eat the flesh of their sons anddaughters: in the stress of the siege to which they shallbe reduced by their enemies and by those that seektheir life, they will devour one another.

[19:10] Then thou shalt break the flask in the presence of[19:11] the men that accompany thee, and thou shalt say tothem, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: This is how I willshatter this people and this city, just as a potter’sjar is shattered beyond all possibility of repair; andTopheth shall be used as a burying-place for want of[19:12] room (elsewhere). This is how I will deal, saithJehovah, with this place and its inhabitants – I will[19:13] make this city like Topheth; and the houses ofJerusalem and of the kings of Judah shall be, like theplace of Topheth, defiled – all the houses, that is,from whose roofs the smoke of sacrifice has ascendedto the host of heaven, and drink-offerings have beenpoured out to other gods.

##### Jeremiah Put in the Stocks for his Preaching #####

[19:14] Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth to whichJehovah had sent him on his prophetic errand; and,taking his stand in the Temple court he thus addressed[19:15] the assembled people: "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,the God of Israel, Mark this well; soon I will bringupon this city and upon all her villages the full measureof disaster with which I have threatened her, becausethey have stiffened their necks and refused to listento My words."

 [Jeremiah 20] 

[20:1] Now when Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest,who had the general supervision of the Temple, heard[20:2] this prophetic utterance of Jeremiah’s, he beat himand put him in the stocks that were at the upper[20:3] Benjamin gate in the Temple. Next day, afterPashhur had released Jeremiah from the stocks,Jeremiah said to him, "Thy name is (henceforth)[20:4] changed from Pashhur to Terror. For thus saithJehovah: See! I will make thee a terror to thyselfand to all thy friends. They shall fall by the enemy’ssword, and thou shalt see it with thine own eyes. Iwill give the whole of Judah into the hands of theking of Babylon, and he shall carry them to exile in[20:5] Babylon and slay them with the sword. And all theresources of this city, all her wealth, all that she prizes,all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will deliverinto the hands of their enemies, who shall despoil them[20:6] and carry them off to Babylon. As for thee, Pashhur,thou and all who share thy home shall be swept intocaptivity. To Babylon thou shalt come; therethou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried – thouand all the friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies."

#### Jeremiah’s Irresistible Impulse to Preach ####

##### What it Cost #####

|  [20:7] O Jehovah, Thou hast beguiled me,
|    And I let myself be beguiled;
|  Too strong for me art Thou,
|    And Thou hast won the victory.
|  All the day long am I ridiculed,
|    Every one mocketh at me.
|  [20:8] Every word that I utter is laughed at;
|    "Wronged" and "despoiled" must I cry.
|  For to me is the word of Jehovah
|    An endless reproach and derision.
|  [20:9] When I vow to put it out my mind
|    And to speak in His name no more,
|  It doth burn in my heart like a fire
|    Shut up within my bones;
|  I am weary of enduring,
|    and I can bear it no more.
|  [20:10] For I hear their many whispers–
|    A terror on every side–
|  "Denounce him." "Yes, we will denounce him."
|    "All ye his familiar friends,
|  Keep a narrow watch for his stumbling,
|    Perchance he will be beguiled,
|  And we shall prevail against him,
|    And take our vengeance upon him."

##### The Prophet’s Sense of Divine Support #####

|  [20:11] But Jehovah Himself is with me,
|    As a mighty One and a terrible;
|  So my persecutors shall stumble,
|    And they shall not prevail;
|  But because they have dealt unwisely,
|    They shall come to utter shame,
|  To perpetual confusion,
|    Which never shall be forgotten.
|  [20:12] O Jehovah that triest the righteous,
|    That mind and heart dost behold,
|  Let me see Thy vengeance upon them;
|    For on Thee have I rolled my cause.
|  [20:13] Sing to Jehovah, sing praise to Jehovah:
|    For He hath delivered the soul of the needy
|    From the hand of evil-doers.

##### The Prophet’s Despair #####

|  [20:14] A curse on the day whereon I was born,
|    Unblest be the day that my mother bore me.
|  [20:15] A curse on the man who announced to my father
|    "A man child is born to thee" – making him glad.
|  [20:16] Let the fate of that man be the fate of the cities
|    O’erthrown by Jehovah in pitiless anger;
|  Let him hear in the morning a cry (of distress)
|    And at noon the alarum of war:
|  [20:17] That he slew me not in the womb,
|    So my mother had been my grave,
|  And her womb had been great for ever.

[20:18] O why came I forth from the womb

|  To behold but labour and sorrow,
|    That my days should be wasted with shame?

#### Jeremiah Warns King Zedekiah that the Babylonians will Capture Jerusalem ####

 [Jeremiah 21] 

[21:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,when King Zedekiah sent the following request to himthrough Pashhur, the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah,[21:2] the son of Maaseiah the priest. "Be good enough," theysaid, "to enquire of Jehovah on our behalf: forNebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon is fighting againstus. Perhaps Jehovah will so deal with us in His ownwonderful way that the siege will be raised."

[21:3] To the deputation Jeremiah replied: "Take this[21:4] answer back to Zedekiah. Thus saith Jehovah, theGod of Israel: Now you are able to fight outside thewall with the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans whoare besieging you; but soon I will drive you with the[21:5] weapons you handle inside this city. And I myselfwill fight against you with outstretched hand andmighty arm – in anger, in fury, and in towering wrath.[21:6] Yes, I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man[21:7] and beast, with a great and deadly pestilence. There-after, saith Jehovah, Zedekiah, king of Judah and hisministers and the people in this city that survive thepestilence, sword and famine, I will deliver into thehands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and intothe hands of their enemies, and into the hands of thosethat seek their life; and they shall smite them withthe edge of the sword without mercy, compassion, orpity.

[21:8] To the people thy message shall be this. Thus saithJehovah: See! I set before you the way of life and the[21:9] way of death. Whoever remains in this city shall dieby sword, famine, or pestilence; but whoever goes outand surrenders to the Chaldeans that besiege you shallbe spared, though he shall escape with nothing but[21:10] his life. For, saith Jehovah, I have set My face againstthis city for evil and not for good; into the hands of theking of Babylon it shall be given, and he shall burn itwith fire.

[21:11] To the royal house of Judah thy message shall bethis.Hear ye the word of Jehovah.

[21:12] O household of David, thus saith Jehovah:In the morning give righteous judgment,
|    Deliver the man that is plundered
|    From the clutch of his oppressor:

|  Lest My fury break forth like fire
|    And blaze unquenchably,
|    Because of your evil doings.
|  [21:13] Behold, I am against thee,
|    Thou denizen of the vale
|    And the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah:
|  Ye who say, ’Who can come down against us
|    And find his way into our lairs?’
|  [21:14] I will punish you, saith Jehovah;
|    The fruit of your deeds ye shall reap:
|  I will kindle a fire in her forest
|    Which round and round will devour."

#### Jeremiah’s Judgment on the Kings of Judah ####

##### Solemn Warning #####

 [Jeremiah 22] 

[22:1] Jehovah commanded me to go down to the palaceof the king of Judah and there deliver the following[22:2] message: O king of Judah that sittest on the throne ofDavid, listen to the word of Jehovah – thou and thyministers and thy people who enter these gates.[22:3] Thus saith Jehovah: Conduct your administration onprinciples of justice and right, deliver the victimsof exploitation from the clutch of the oppressor, refrainfrom all wrong and violence to the resident alien, thefatherless and the widow, and shed no innocent blood[22:4] in this place. If you carry out this policy faithfully,then kings upon the throne of David shall pass through tthe gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses[22:5] –they, their ministers and their people. But if youignore this message (of Mine), then, saith Jehovah, Isolemnly swear that this house shall be laid in ruins.

[22:6] For thus saith Jehovah concerning the palace of theking of Judah:Though thou art to Me as Gilead,
|    Or the (thick-wooded) summit of Lebanon,

|  I will turn thee into a desert,
|    An unihabited city.
|  [22:7] I will dedicate men to destroy thee,
|    Every one with his weapons;
|  They shall fell thy choicest cedars,
|    And hurl them into the fire.

[22:8] The people of many nations, as they pass by this city,shall ask one another why Jehovah has dealt thus with[22:9] this great city, and they shall answer: It is becausethey abandoned their convenant with Jehovah theirGod and gave themselves up to the worship and serviceof other gods.

##### On Jehoahaz #####

|  [22:10] Weep not for him that is dead,
|    And mourn not for him;
|  But weep rather for him that is gone,
|    For he cometh no more:
|  And the land of his birth he shall see
|    Nevermore.

[22:11] For this is the word of Jehovah concerning Shallum,the son of Josiah, king of Judah, the successor of hisfather Josiah, who went forth from this place: "He[22:12] shall never come back to it again; but in the land ofexile to which they have carried him he shall die, andthis land he shall see no more."

##### On Jehoiakim #####

|  [22:13] Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
|    And his chambers by injustice,
|  That serveth himself of his neighbour for nothing,
|    And giveth him not his wages–
|  [22:14] That saith, "I will build me a spacious house,
|    And roomy chambers and windows broad,
|  With panels of cedar, and painted vermilion,"

[22:15] Do great cedar palaces make thee a king?

|  Did not thy father eat and drink,
|    And enjoy his measure of good things?
|  Yet justice and right did he also dispense
|  [22:16] And he cared for the cause of the poor and the needy.
|    Is not that true knowledge of Me, saith Jehovah?
|  [22:17] But thou hast neither eyes nor heart
|    For aught save thine own mean profit,
|  The shedding of innocent blood,
|    And the practice of wrong and oppression.
|  [22:18] This, therefore, is the message of Jehovah to Jehoia-
|  kim, the son Josiah, king of Judah:
|    Woe unto this man Jehoiakim!
|  No one for him shall lament
|    " O brother of mine," "O sister."
|  No one for him shall lament
|    "An lord!" "Alas for his glory."
|  [22:19] But burial like that of an ass shall be his–
|    Dragged along and flung forth
|    Beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

##### On Jehoiachin #####

|  [22:20] Get thee up tp Lebanon and cry,
|    And lift up thy voice in Bashan;
|  Cry from the hills of Abarim.
|    For all that thou lovest is shattered.
|  [22:21] In the days of good fortune I spoke to thee,
|    But thou didst refuse to listen;
|  And such hath thy way been from youth,
|    To my voice thou hast never hearkened.
|  [22:22] All thy shepherds like sheep by the wind shall be driven,
|    And those whom thou lovest shall captive depart;
|  Shame and confusion shall then be thy doom,
|    In requital for all thy wickedness.
|  [22:23] O thou that inhabitest Lebanon,
|    Nestled amongst the cedars,
|  How wilt thou groan when thy pangs come upon thee,
|    Thy pain as of woman in travail!

[22:24] As truly as I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah,the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet-ring on thy right hand, yet I would tear him off

[22:25] Yea, I will delilver thee into the hands of those thatseek thy life, and into the hands of those thou dreadest,into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,[22:26] and into the hands of the Chaldeans. Yea, thee andthe mother that bore thee I will hurl into another landthan the land thou wast born in, and there thou shalt[22:27] die. Nevermore shall they return to the land to whichthey long to return.[22:28] Hath this man Coniah become
|    Like a figure one smasheth in scorn,
|    Or a vessel that no man doth care for?

|  Why hath he been cast forth,
|    And hurled to a land that was strange to him?
|  [22:29] O land, land, land,
|    Hear thou the word of Jehovah.
|  [22:30] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Write this man down as childless;
|    For none of his seed shall be honoured
|  To sit on the throne of David
|    Or rule any more over Judah.

##### Unfaithful Rulers to be Succeeded by those that are Faithful #####

 [Jeremiah 23] 

|  [23:1] Woe to the shepherds that ruin and scatter
|    The flock that was theirs to pasture.
|  [23:2] Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel,
|    Concerning the shepherds that tend my people:
|  Ye have scattered My flock and driven them away,
|    And ye have not visited them;
|  I therefore will visit you
|    For the wickedness of your doings.
|  [23:3] I will gather My flock that is left
|    From the countries to which I have driven them;
|  I will bring them back to their homesteads,
|    And they shall be fruitful and multiply.
|  [23:4] I will raise up shepherds to tend to them:
|    No fear or dismay or terror
|    Shall they know any more, saith Jehovah.

##### Promise of the Ideal King, or Messiah #####

|  [23:5] Behold, saith Jehovah, in the days that are coming
|    I will raise up to David a righteous shoot,
|  Who shall reign as King, and behave with wisdom,
|    And execute justice and right in the land.
|  [23:6] In his days shall Judah be crowned with salvation,
|    And Israel in safety shall dwell;
|  And this is the name men shall call him–
|    "Our Champion is Jehovah."

[23:7] Therefore, behold, saith Jehovah, days are comingwhen men shall no more say, "As surely as Jehovahliveth who brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt,"[23:8] but "As surely as Jehovah liveth who brought the raceof the household of Israel from the north country andfrom all the countries to which He had driven them";and they shall dwell in their own land.

#### Jeremiah’s Judgment on the Prophets ####

##### The Character and Fate of the False Prophets #####

[23:9] Concerning the prophets.

|  My heart within me is broken,
|    My bones are all grown soft;
|  Like a drunken man am I,
|    Like a man overcome of wine,
|  By reason of Jehovah
|    And of His glorious majesty.
|  [23:10] For the land is full of adulterers
|    Who run an evil course,
|    And whose might is not of right.
|  [23:11] For prophet and priest are profane:
|    Their wickedness I have witnessed
|    In Mine own very house, saith Jehovah.
|  [23:12] The way they must tread shall be therefore
|    As slippery ground in the darkness,
|    Whereon they are thrust till they fall:
|  For I will bring evil upon them–
|    The year of their visitation.
|  [23:13] In samaria’s prophets I witnessed
|    Behaviour that was revolting;
|  They prophesied by the Baal
|    And seduced My people Israel.
|  [23:14] But a horrible thing have I seen
|    In the prophets of Jerusalem–
|  Adultery, walking in falsehood,
|    And strengthening the hands of the wicked,
|    That no man doth turn from his wickedness.
|  They are all of them grown like Sodom,
|    And her citizens like Gomorrah.
|  [23:15] Thus therefore concerning the prophets
|    Declareth Jehovah of Hosts:
|  Behold! I will feed them with wormwood,
|    And gall will I give them to drink;
|  For from Jerusalem’s prophets there spreadeth
|    Impiety over the land.

##### The Promises are False, because the Prophets are not Divinely Inspired #####

|  [23:16] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|    Hearken not to the words of the prophets;
|  They fill you with hopes that are vain.
|    ’Tis their own heart’s vision they utter,
|    And not what Jehovah hath spoken.
|  [23:17] They assure thos who mock at the word of Jehovah
|    That all with them shall be well.
|  They assure those who follow their own stubborn hearts
|    That no evil shall come upon them.
|  [23:18] But which of them ever hath stood and looked on
|    In the council of Jehovah?
|  Or which of them ever hath listened
|    And heard any word of His?
|  [23:21] I sent not the prophets, and yet they ran;
|    Notwithstanding I spoke not to them, yet they prophesied.
|  [23:22] But if ever they truly had stood in My council
|    And heard any word that was Mine,
|  My people they would have turned
|    From their evil ways and behaviour.

##### Inescapable Doom of the False Prophets #####

|  [23:23] Am I, saith Jehovah, a God that is nigh,
|    And not a God afar?
|  [23:24] Can any man hide, saith Jehovah,
|    In secret, where I cannot see him?
|    Do not I fill heaven and earth?
|  [23:25] I have heard what the prophets say,
|    That prophesy lies in My name;
|    "I have dreamed, I have dreamed, I have dreamed."
|  [23:26] Will the heart of the prophets not turn
|    That prophesy lies, and that prophesy
|  Nought but their own heart’s delusions,

[23:27] And think to drive My name

|  Clean out of the minds of My people
|    By the dreams that they tell one another,
|  As erst by the Baal My name
|    Was driven from the mind of their fathers?
|  [23:28] The prophet that hath a dream–
|    Let him declare his dream:
|  And he that hath My word–
|    Let him faithfully utter My word.
|  What hath straw, saith Jehovah, to do with the wheat?
|  [23:29] Is not My word like a fire,
|    Like a hammer that shatters the rocks?

[23:30] Mark this, therefore, saith Jehovah, I am againstthe prophets that steal My words from one another.[23:31] I am against the prophets who take their tongues[23:32] and immediately reel off an oracle. I am against theprophets that prophesy living dreams, seducing Mypeople by their lies and their windy boasts. They havenot been sent by Me, nor have they any commissionfrom Me, and to this people they bring no sort of gainwhatever.

##### The "Burden" of the Lord No More #####

[23:33] When a layman or a prophet or a priest asketh theewhat is the burden of Jehovah, tell them, "You"saith Jehovah, "are the burden, and I will cast you off.[23:34] As for the prophet, the priest, or the layman, whospeaks any more of Jehovah’s ’burden,’, that man and[23:35] his household I will visit with judgment. You mustsay to one another, ’What is Jehovah’s answer?’ or[23:36] ’What is Jehovah’s message?’ But you are not tomake mention to the burden of Jehovah any more.Every man’s own (uninspired) word shall be hisburden; for you have perverted the words of the[23:38] living God, Jehovah of Hosts, our God. If, however,you persist in speaking of ’the burden of Jehovah,’Jehovah pronounces this word of doom: Because youpersist in using this expression ’burden of Jehovah,’despite My explicit command to you not to use it,[23:39] I will lift you up and cast you out of My sight – you[23:40] and the city I gave to you and your fathers, and Iwill lay upon you everlasting reproach and unendingdisgrace which shall never be forgotten."

#### The Baskets of Figs and their Meaning ####

 [Jeremiah 24] 

[24:1] After Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,with the princes, the craftsmen and the smiths, had beencarried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar, king ofBabylon, into exile in Babylon, Jehovah in a visionshowed me two baskets of figs set down in front of[24:2] Jehovah’s Temple. One basket contained excellentfigs, like the figs that are first ripe: the figs in the otherwere very bad, so bad that they could not be eaten."

[24:3] Then Jehovah said to me, "What seest thou, Jere-miah?" And I answered, "Figs – the good figs verygood, and the bad very bad, so bad that they cannot beeaten."

[24:4] Thereupon this message came to me from Jehovah,

[24:5] "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: As with thesegood figs, so will I regard with favour the exiles ofJudah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land[24:6] of the Chaldeans. I will set Mine eyes upon them forgood, and bring them back to this land. I will not pullthem down, but I will build them; I will not pluck themup, but I will plant them; and I will give them a heartto understand me, that I am Jehovah. They shall beMy people and I will be their God, if they turn to Mewith all their heart.

[24:8] As for the figs that were too bad to eat, Thus saithJehovah: They are symbolic of the fate of Zedekiah,king of Judah, and his princes, and the survivors ofJerusalem that are left in this land, and those whose[24:9] home is in the land of Egypt. For I will make theman object of consternation among every kingdom inthe world, a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and acurse, in every place to which I shall drive them;[24:10] and I will send among them sword, famine and pesti-lence, till they perish from the land that I gave to themand their forefathers.

#### The Divine Judgment to be Executed by the Babylonians ####
upon Judah, upon the Neighbouring Nations, and upon the World at Large

##### Prophetic Warning Disregarded by the People #####

 [Jeremiah 25] 

[25:1] The message which came to Jeremiah concerning allthe people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,the son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first[25:2] year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon – the mes-sage he delivered to all the people of Judah and allthe citizens of Jerusalem:

[25:3] For twenty-three years – from the thirteenth yearof Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, up to thisday – the message of Jehovah has been coming to me,and I have declared it to you early and late, but you[25:4] have not listened. And early and late Jehovah hasbeen sending to you all His servants the prophets,through you have not listened nor inclined an attentive[25:5] ear. My message was this: "If you abandon, everyman of you, your wicked ways and your evil behaviour,then you shall dwell for ever in the land which Jehovah,gave in the ancient time to you and your forefathers.[25:6] But do not indulge in the worship or service of othergods, and do not provoke Jehovah with the fabri-cations of your own hands: this can only injure your-[25:7] selves." But you have not listened to me.

##### Judgment upon Judah and Her Neighbours #####

[25:8] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Because[25:9] ye have not listened to My words, I will send andfetch a clan from the north, and I will bring themagainst this land and its inhabitants and against thesorrounding nation. I will devote them to destruc-tion so appalling that men shall hiss and revile them[25:10] for ever; and I will banish form them the voice of mirthand gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, thesound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.[25:11] This whole land shall be a waste and a horror, andthese nations shall serve the king of Babylon for seventyyears.

[25:12] When, however, seventy years are completed, I will punishthe king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for theirguilt, and also the land of the Chaldeans, which I will make[25:13] desolate for ever; and I will bring upon that land all the wordsI have pronounced against it – everything prophesied byJeremiah against all the nations, that is recorded in this Book.[25:14] They, yes they, shall be reduced to slavery at the hands ofmany nations and of great kings, and I will give them the rewardthat their acts and deeds deserve.

##### The Cup of Jehovah’s Fury to be Drunk by all Nations #####

[25:15] For thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, to me,"Take from My hand this wine-cup of wrath, and giveit to all the nations to whom I send thee to drink from;[25:16] and let them drink and reel in madness because of the[25:17] sword that I will send among them." So I took thecup from the hand of Jehovah, and I gave it to all thenations to whom Jehovah had sent me, to drink from–[25:18] Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with her kings andprinces, to be made a desolation, a horror, a scorn,[25:19] and a curse; Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with his[25:20] ministers, his princes, and all his people, and allthe foreign folk; all the kings of the land of Uz, andall the kings of the land of the Philistines – Ashkelon,[25:21] Gaza, Ekron, and the survivors of Ashdod; Edom,[25:22] Moab, and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and sidon;and the kings of the coast-land across the sea;[25:23] Dedan and Tema and Buz, and all those that have the[25:24] corners of their hair clipped; all the kings of NorthernArabia, and all the kings of the north, far and near,one with another, and all the kingdoms on the face ofthe earth; and after them shall the king of Sheshachdrink.

[25:27] Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,the God of Israel: Drink yourselves drunk till ye fall inyour vomit, to rise no more, because of the sword that I[25:28] shall send among you. If they refuse to take the cup fromthy hand to drink, then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith[25:29] Jehovah of Hosts: Drink it you shall; for, if the citywhich is called by Mine own name is the first to feel theweight of My displeasure, how can you expect to goutterly unpunished? Nay, verily, ye shall not escape;for I am summoning the sword upon all the inhabitantsof the earth, saith Jehovah of Hosts.

[25:30] As for thee, let thy prophetic message to them bethis:Jehovah will roar from on high,
|    He will utter His voice from His holy abode;

|  Against His own fold He will mightily roar,
|    He will lift a "hurrah" like the men at the vintage
|    Against those that dwell on the earth, every one.
|  [25:31] Then din shall reach to the end of the earth,
|    For Jehovah doth hold a dispute with the nations;
|  Yeah, He with all flesh will contend in judgment,
|    And those that are base He will give to the sword.
|  [25:32] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|    See! misery spreadeth from nation to nation;
|  From the uttermost corners of earth
|    There stirreth a mighty tempest.
|  [25:33] That day the slain of Jehovah shall lie
|    From one end of the earth to the other,
|  Unmourned, ungathered, unburied,
|    As dung on the face of the ground.
|  [25:34] Howl, ye shepherds, and cry,
|    And roll you in ashes, ye lords of the flock;
|  For the days are ripe for your slaughter,
|    Like lambs that are doomed shall ye fall.
|  [25:35] No escape shall be left for the shepherds,
|    No flight for the lords of the flock;
|  [25:36] O hark to the cry of the shepherds,
|    The howl of the lords of the flock;
|    For Jehovah destroyeth their pasture.
|  [25:37] The meadows, so peaceful, are hushed
|    At the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah.
|  [25:38] The lions have left their covert,
|    For the land is become a desert,
|  Because of the cruel sword,
|    And because of His fierce hot anger.

#### Jeremiah on Trial for his life ####

 [Jeremiah 26] 

[26:1] In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son ofJosiah, king of Judah, the message which follows came[26:2] (to Jeremiah) from Jehovah: Thus saith Jehovah,Take thy stand in the Temple court, and declare with-out reservation to all the people of Judah who are cometo worship in the Temple, the whole message that I[26:3] have commissioned thee to declare. It may be thatthey will listen and severally abandon their wickedways: if they do, I will relent and not bring upon themthe calamity I am planning as penalty for their evil[26:4] behaviour. This, then, is what thou art to say tothem, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye refuse to obey Me–to live in accordance with the law that I have set before[26:5] you, and to listen, as ye have never yet listened, to thewords of My servants the prophets, whom early and[26:6] late I have been sending to you – then I will make thisTemple like Shiloh, and as for this city, I will turn itinto an object of execration to every nation in the world.

[26:7] Now the audience that listened to this message ofJeremiah’s in the Temple included not only the wholebody of the people, but the priests and the prophets[26:8] as well. So when he had concluded the message whichJehovah had commissioned him to declare to the whole[26:9] people, the priests and the prophets seized him. "Youmust die," they exclaimed; "for how dare youdeliver in the name of Jehovah such a message as this,that this Temple will meet the fate of Shiloh, and thatthis city shall become an inhabited desolation?"At this juncture all the people began to crowd roundJeremiah in the Temple.

[26:10] Now echoes of this tumult having reached the earsof the countries of Judah, they proceeded from thepalace up to the Temple; and after they had takentheir seats at the entrance to the new gate of the Temple,[26:11] the priests and the prophets addressed themselves tothe countries and the whole body of the people. "Thisman." they said, "is guilty of a capital offence; forhe has solemnly declared that this city is doomed–[26:12] you have heard him with your own ears. ThenJeremiah in his turn addressed himself to the courtiersand to the whole body of the people. "It is JehovahHimself," he said, "that has sent me to proclaim uponthis Temple and city the doom which you have just[26:13] heard. If, however, you amend your life and con-duct, and listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, thenHe will relent and cancel His threat of catastrophe.[26:14] As for myself, I am in your hands: deal with me as[26:15] you think right and proper. But be very sure of this,that, if you put me to death, you will only be bringinginnocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, andupon her people; for it is the simple truth that Jehovahhas sent me to deliver this message in your hearing."[26:16] Thereupon, the courtiers and all the people said to thepriests and the prophets, "This man is not guilty ofany capital offence; for his message to us has behindit the authority of Jehovah our God."

[26:17] Them some of the elders, rising to their feet, thus ad-[26:18] dressed the people assembled: "In the days of Hezekiah,king of Judah," they said, "Micah of Moresheth wasprophesying; and this is what he said to all the peopleof Judah:Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:Like a field shall Zion be ploughed,
|    And Jerusalem levelled to ruins;

|  And the Temple Mount shall become
|    Like a thickly wooded height.

[26:19] Did Hezekiah the king or the people of Judah dreamof putting him to death? Rather were they not so over-come by godly fear that they sued for the favour ofJehovah, with the result that He relented and cancelledHis threat of catastrophe? But look at us! Why, we areon the verge of involving ourselves in a great calamity."

[26:24] Jeremiah, however, had (also) the support of Ahikam,the son of Shaphan, who saved him from being deliveredto the people for execution.

##### The Fate of Urijah #####

[26:20] There was another case of a man who deliveredprophetic messages in the name of Jehovah – Uriah,the son of Shemaiah, who belonged to Kiriath-jearim.Quite in the manner of Jeremiah, he too had pronounced[26:21] the doom of this city and land. His message havingreached the ears of King Jehoiakim, with all the courtand the military officials, the king took steps to havehim put to death. Urijah, however, got wind of hispurpose, and in terror he took to flight, finally reaching[26:22] Egypt; but King Jehoiakim despatched commis-sioners to Egypt – Elnathan the son of Achbor, and a few[26:23] others – who removed him from Egypt and broughthim back to the presence of King Jehoiakim, whohad him slain with the sword, and his dead body flunginto the public burying-ground.

##### No Hope of Speedy Release from Babylon #####

#### The Babylonian Yoke will not be soon or easily Broken ####

 [Jeremiah 27] 

[27:1] In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the sonof Josiah, king of Judah, Jeremiah received from[27:2] Jehovah the message which follows. Thus spokeJehovah: Make thongs and bars and put them on[27:3] thy neck, and send a message to the kings of Edom,Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon, through their am-bassadors who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah,[27:4] king of Judah, and bid them say to their masters,"Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:[27:5] Convey this message to your masters. I have madethe earth, with man and beast on the face of it,by My great power and outstretched arm, and I give it[27:6] to whomsoever I please. At the moment I have givenall these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, kingof Babylon, My servant; the beasts of the field alsohave I given him to serve him.

[27:7] All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson,till the time of his own land shall come – then many nationsand great kings shall make him serve.

[27:8] The nation and the kingdom which refuses to serveNebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and to put theirnecks to the yoke of the king of Babylon – that nation,saith Jehovah, I will punish with sword, famine andpestilence, till I have delivered them into his hands.

[27:9] As for yourselves, do not listen to your prophets,diviners, dreamers, soothsayers, or sorcerers, whoassure you that you will not be subject to the king of[27:10] Babylon. It is a lie that they preach to you, and itwill end in your removal from your own land; for I[27:11] will indeed drive you away and ye shall perish. Butthe nation that brings its neck to the yoke of the king ofBabylon and serves him, I will leave on their own soil,which they shall continue to till and occupy."

[27:12] A similar message I gave to zedekiah, king of Judah,"If,’ said I, "you bring your neck to the yoke of theking of Babylon, and serve him and his people, you will[27:13] be spared. Why should you and your people die by thesword, famine and pestilence, with which Jehovah hasthreatened the nation that refuses to serve the king of[27:14] Babylon? Do not listen to the prophets when they tellyou that you will not be subject to the king of Babylon:[27:15] they are preaching to you a lie. I have not sent them,saith Jehovah: it is a lie that they are preaching to youin My name, and it can only end in your being drivenout and perishing – you and the prophets that preachto you."

[27:16] And the message that I gave to the priests and to allthis people was this: "Thus saith Jehovah: Do notlisten to the prophets when they tell you that the vesselsof the Temple will soon be brought back from Babylon.[27:17] They are preaching to you a lie: do not listen to them.Serve the king of Babylon and you will be spared:[27:18] why should this city become a ruin? But if they arereal prophets with a real message from Jehovah, letthem entreat Jehovah of Hosts not to allow the vesselsthat are left in the Temple and in the royal palace at[27:19] Jerusalem, to be taken to Babylon. For thus saithJehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars and the seaand the stands and the rest of the vessels that are left[27:20] in this city, which were not taken by Nebuchadnezzar,king of Babylon, when he carried Jeconiah, the son ofJehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the nobles of Judah[27:21] and Jerusalem, from Jerusalem to Babylon. Yes,thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, con-cerning the vessels that are left in the Temple and in[27:22] the royal palace and at Jerusalem; To Babylonthey shall be brought, and there they shall remain tillthe day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then I willbring them up and restore them to this place."

#### The Clash between the False Prophet and the True ####

 [Jeremiah 28] 

[28:1] The same year, at the beginning of the reign ofZedekiah, king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourthyear, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, whobelonged to Gibeon, addressed me as follows in theTemple in the presence of the priests and of all the[28:2] people. "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God ofIsrael: ’I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.[28:3] Within two years’ time I will bring back to this place allthe Temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, king ofBabylon took from this place and carried to Babylon;[28:4] and Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, andall the exiles of Judah that have gone to Babylon, Iwill bring back to this place, saith Jehovah; for I willbreak the yoke of the king of Babylon.’"

[28:5] Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to Hananiah theprophet in the presence of the priests and of all thepeople that were standing in the Temple; and Jeremiah[28:6] the prophet said, "Amen! Jehovah do so! MayJohevah fulfil your prophecy and bring back the Templevessels and all the exiles from Babylon to this place![28:7] I ask you, however to listen to this word that I amabout to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all[28:8] the people. From the beginning the prophets who pre-ceded you and me in their messages concerning many[28:9] lands and mighty kingdoms, prophesied war. If aprophet prophesies peace, it is only when his word hasbeen fulfilled that you can be sure that he has had a real[28:10] commission from Jehovah." Then Hananiah took the[28:11] bar off Jeremiah’s neck, broke it, and declared in thepresence of all the people, "Thus saith Jehovah:’Within two years’ time, I will similarly break theyoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, off thenecks of all the nations.’" Then Jeremiah the prophetwent away.

[28:12] But after Hananiah had broken the bar off Jeremiah’sneck, there came to Jeremiah this message from[28:13] Jehovah: "Go and say to Hananiah, Thus saithJehovah, The wooden bar you have indeed broken,but[28:14] I will replace it with a bar of iron. For thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The yoke that Iwill put on the necks of all these nations will be madeof iron – a yoke of service to Nebuchadnezzar, king ofBabylon: for serve him they shall. I have also given[28:15] him the beasts of the field." Then Jeremiah said toHananiah, "Listen, Hananiah. You have no com-[28:16] mission from Jehovah: you are making this peopletrust a lie. Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ’Mark thiswell: I will dismiss thee from the face of the earth.This very year thou shalt die; for thy words are a[28:17] disloyalty to Jehovah.’" And that very year, in theseventh month, the prophet Hananaiah died.

#### Jeremiah Exhorts the Exiles to settle down in Babylon ####

 [Jeremiah 29] 

[29:1] The following is a copy of the letter sent fromJerusalem by Jeremiah the prophet to the elders, thepriests, the prophets, and all the people, who had beencarried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to exile in[29:2] Babylon – after the surrender of Jeconiah the king,and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princesof Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and smiths–[29:3] the letter being sent by the hands of Eleasah the son ofShaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, who hadbeen despatched to Babylon to Nebuchanezzar, king ofBabylon, by Zedekiah, king of Judah:

[29:4] "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, toall the exiles whom I have carried from Jerusalem to[29:5] Babylon: Build houses and settle; plant gardensand eat the fruit of them; take wives and rear families;[29:6] take wives also for your sons and give your daughtersto husbands, that they may have sons and daughters;increase your numbers and do not let them diminish.[29:7] And strive for the welfare of the country to which Ihave brought you as exiles. Pray for it to Jehovah;for your own welfare and hers are bound up together.[29:8] For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Do not let yourselves be beguiled by the prophets anddiviners in your midst, and do not listen to the dreams[29:9] they dream; for it is a lie that they preach to you inMy name – they have no commission from Me, saithJehovah.

[29:10] For thus saith Jehovah: As soon as Babylon’sseventy years are accomplished, I will visit you andbring you back to this place, in fulfilment of the garcious[29:11] promise I made you. For I know the thoughts I cherishtowards you – thoughts of weal and not of woe – to[29:12] bestow upon you a future and a hope. When youcall, I will answer you, and I will listen to your[29:13] prayer. If ye seek Me ye shall find Me. If ye seek[29:14] Me with all your heart, I will reveal Myself to you,saith Jehovah; and I will restore your fortunes and gather youfrom all the nations and places to which I have driven you,saith Jehovah, and I will bring you back to the place fromwhich I carried you into exile.

[29:16] For thus saith Jehovah concerning the king who sits onthe throne of David, and concerning all the people whose homeis in this city – those brethren of yours who have not had to[29:17] accompany you into exile. Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: See! Iwill send the sword, the famine and the pestilence among them,and I will make them like figs that are too horribly bad to eat.[29:18] I will hunt them with sword, famine, and pestilence and I willmake them an object of consternation to every kingdom in theworld, and object of execration and horror, of scorn and insult[29:19] among all the nations to which I have driven them; because,saith Jehovah, they refused to listen to the messages I sent themearly and late through My servants the prophets – yes, they[29:20] refused to listen, saith Jehovah. See, then, that ye listen toJehovah’s message, all of you exiles whom I have sent fromJerusalem to Babylon.[29:15] But Jehovah, you say, has raised up for you prophets[29:21] in Babylon. Well, thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, theGod of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah andZedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who preach to you a liein My name. Mark this: I will deliver them into thehands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and he[29:22] will slay them before your eyes; and their fate shall beadopted by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon as amodel for imprecation. "Jehovah make thee," theywill say, "like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of[29:23] Babylon roasted in the fire," because they wroughtimpious folly in Israel, in committing adultery withtheir neighbours’ wives and delivering in My namelying messages which I never gave them. Well Iknow it, saith Jehovah, and I am witness."

[29:24] Touching the message of Jehovah of Hosts, theGod of Israel, to be delivered by Jeremiah concerning[29:25] Shemaiah of Nehelam. This is the man who sent aletter in his own name to Zephaniah, the son of[29:26] Maaseiah the priest. "Jehovah," he wrote, "hasmade you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,to exercise an oversight in the Temple over all that playthe mad prophet and the ecstatic, and to put all such[29:27] in the stocks and in the iron collar. Why then did younot rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth, who has been playing[29:28] the mad prophet among you? For he has sent amessage to us in Babylon, maintaining that the exilewould be long, and urging us to build houses and settle,and to plant gardens and eat the fruit of them."[29:29] Now Zephaniah the priest read the letter in the hearingof Jeremiah the prophet.

[29:30] Then there came to Jeremiah this message from[29:31] Jehovah: Send to all the exiles and say, Thus saithJehovah concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Shemaiahhas been prophesying to you without any commission[29:32] from Me and has made you trust in a lie. For thisreason, therefore– thus saith Jehovah – I will punishShemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants: not aman shall he have among you who will ever see the goodfortune I will bring you, saith Jehovah: for his wordsare a disloyalty to Jehovah.

##### The Glorious Future #####

#### The Restoration of Israel and Judah ####

##### Promise of Deliverance in the Day of Distress #####

 [Jeremiah 30] 

[30:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah:[30:2] Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Write all the[30:3] words I have spoken to thee in a book. For mark!the days are coming, saith Jehovah, when I will restorethe fortunes of My people Israel and Judah, and re-establish them in possession of the land I gave theirforefathers.

[30:4] Now these are the words Jehovah hath spoken[30:5] concerning Israel and Judah. Yea, thus saith Jehovah:

|  We have heard a cry of terror,
|    Of horror and dispeace.
|  [30:6] Ask ye now and see
|    If a man doth travail with child.
|  What meaneth them this sight–
|    Every man with his hands on his loins?
|  And what mean all these faces
|    Turned to a deathly pallor?
|  [30:7] Alas! for great is this day,
|    No day is like unto it;
|  A time of distress for Jacob–
|    Yet out of it he shall be saved.
|  [30:8] On that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    I will break the yoke from their necks;
|  I will snap their bonds asunder,
|    And strangers no more shall they serve.
|  [30:9] But Jehovah their God they shall serve.
|    And David also, their king,
|    Whom I will raise up unto them.
|  [30:10] So fear thou not, O Jacob My servant,
|    O Israel, be not dismayed, saith Jehovah.
|  For see! I will save both thee and thine offspring
|    From the far distant land where captive ye lie.
|  And Jacob once more shall have quite and ease
|    In his own land, with no one make him afraid;

[30:11] For I, saith Jehovah, am with thee to save thee.

|  An end I will make of the nations–
|    Of each, among whom I have scattered thee;
|  But of thee I will not make an end.
|    I will not leave thee wholly unpunished,
|    But in measure I will chastise thee.

##### Promise of Healing #####

|  [30:12] For thus saith Jehovah:
|    Thou art wounded past all healing,
|    And smitten very sore.
|  [30:13] There is no one to plead thy cause;
|    No healing for thy wound,
|    Thy scars remain unclosed.
|  [30:14] Thy lovers have all forgotten thee,
|    They care for thee no more.
|  I have struck thee as foemen strike,
|    With chastisement unpitying,
|  Because of thy manifold guilt
|    And thy sins` that are grown so mighty.
|  [30:15] Why criest thou over thy wound,
|    That thy pain is past all healing?
|  ’Tis because of thy manifold guilt
|    And thy sins that are grown so mighty,
|    I have done these things unto thee.
|  [30:16] Devoured shall be therefore all those that devour thee,
|    Thine enemies all shall go into captivity;
|  Those that despoil thee themselves shall be spoiled,
|    And thy plunders I will consign to be plundered.
|  [30:17] I will cause new flesh to grow over thy wound,
|    I will heal thy scars, saith Jehovah;
|  For men have called thee an outcast,
|    "Our quarry" – for whom none careth.

##### The Happy City, with her Native Prince #####

|  [30:18] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  The tents that were Jacob’s I yet will restore,
|    On the sites that were his I will show My compassion;
|  On her own proper mound shall the city be built,
|    And the place shall stand on its rightful site.
|  [30:19] And out of them songs of praise shall float,
|    And the voices of them that make merry;
|  I will add to their numbers till many they be,
|    I will crown them with glory, and they shall be honoured.
|  [30:20] Their children shall be as in days of old,
|    And their sacred assembly safe under My care;
|    I will punish all those that oppress them.
|  [30:21] Their prince shall be one of themselves,
|    And their ruler shall come from among them.
|  I will let him draw nigh and approach Me,
|    For where is the man, saith Jehovah,
|    That else had the courage to face Me?
|  [30:22] And ye shall be My people,
|    And I will be your God.

##### Judgment shall Break upon the Wicked #####

|  [30:23] Hark! ’tis Jehovah’s tempest,
|  It goeth forth with fury–
|  A whirling temptest that whirleth
|    Full straight for the heads of the wicked.
|  [30:24] The glowing wrath of Jehovah
|    Shall not be backward turned,
|  Until He have fully accomplished
|    The purpose of His heart.
|    At the end of the days ye shall know what this meaneth.

##### Israel’s Happy Return form Exile #####

 [Jeremiah 31] 

|  [31:1] At that time, saith Jehovah,
|    I will be God indeed
|  Unto all the families of Israel,
|    And they shall be My people.
|  [31:2] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  The people escaped from the sword
|    shall most surely find grace in the wilderness.
|  When Israel seeketh for rest,

[31:3] From afar will Jehovah appear to him.

|  I have loved thee with love everlasting.
|    And so I with kindness have drawn thee.
|  [31:4] Once more, O virgin of Israel,
|    I will build thee up securely:
|  Once more shalt thou deck thee with timbrels,
|    And step in the merry dance;
|  [31:5] Once more on the hills of Samaria
|    Shall vineyards be planted by thee,
|    And the planters shall eat what they planted.
|  [31:6] For a day shall come when the watchers
|    On Ephraim’s highlands shall cry,
|    "Arise, let us pilgrim to Zion,
|    Where dwelleth Jehovah our God."
|  [31:7] For thus saith Jehovah to Jacob,
|    Ring out a cry of joy;
|  Shout on the top of the mountains,
|    Publish, and praise, and say,
|  "Jehovah hath saved His people,
|    The remnant of Israel."
|  [31:8] Behold, from the north land I bring them,
|    And out of earth’s uttermost parts I will gather them–
|  Among them the blind and the lame,
|    And the women with child, with those soon to be mothers;
|    Hither again they shall come – a great company.
|  [31:9] Forth they went with tears,
|    But their homeward way I will comfort;
|  I will lead them to streams of water,
|    On a level way without stumbling;
|  For I am a Father to Israel,
|    And Ephraim is My first-born.
|  [31:10] Hear, O ye nations, the word of Jehovah,
|    Declare it to far distant islands and say,
|  "He that scattered Israel shall gather him,
|    And keep him as shepherd his flock."
|  [31:11] For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob,
|    And redeemed him from hands that were stronger than his.
|  [31:12] They shall come, they shall sing on the heights of Zion,
|    All radiant with joy at the gifts of Jehovah–
|  The corn and the wine and the oil,
|    And the young of the flock and the herd;
|  Their soul like a well-watered garden shall be,
|    And they shall pine no more.
|  [31:13] Then the maids shall rejoice in the dance,
|    And the young and the old shall be merry;
|  I will turn their mourning to joy,
|    I will comfort and gladden them after their sorrow.
|  [31:14] The priests I will satisfy richly,
|    My folk shall be filled with My bounty.

##### Mother Rachel’s Sorrow for her Exiled Children #####

|  [31:15] Hark! there echoes through Ramah,
|    Lament and bitter weeping:
|  ’Tis Rachel bewailing her children,
|    And refusing to be comforted,
|    Because they are no more.
|  [31:16] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Restrain thy voice from weeping,
|    And keep thine eyes from tears;
|  For thy work shall have its reward,
|    From the land of the foe shall thy children return.
|  [31:17] There is hope for thy coming days,
|    Thy children shall return.

##### Israel’s Penitence, Return and Welcome Home #####

|  [31:18] Truly I heard the voice
|    Of Ephraim thus lamenting,
|  "Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened;
|  Like a calf unbroken was I.
|    Bring me back, and let me return,
|    For Thou art Jehovah my God.
|  [31:19] Mine exile hath led me to penitence;
|    Chastened, I smote on my beasts.
|  Put to shame and confusion am I,
|    For I bear the reproach of my youth."
|  [31:20] Is not Ephraim my dear, dear son?
|    Is he not a darling child?
|  For let Me but utter his name,
|    And My mind keeps resting upon him.
|  So My heart for him doth yearn,
|    And pity him I must.
|  [31:21] Set way-marks, and make thee guide-posts;
|  Bethink thee of the highway,;
|    The road by which thou didst travel.
|  Return, O virgin of Israel,
|    Return to these thy cities.
|  [31:22] How long, O backsliding daughter,
|    Wilt thou remain irresolute?
|  For on earth hath Jehovah created a new thing,
|    A woman shall into a man be transformed.

##### The Restoration of Judah #####

|  [31:23] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|    Once more shall this speech be used
|  In the land and the cities of Judah,
|    When I have restored their fortunes:
|  "Jehovah grant thee His blessing,
|    Thou sacred Mountain, where righteousness dwelleth."
|  [31:24] Yea, Judah shall dwell therein,
|    And all her cities together–
|  The men that plough the land,
|    And the shepherds that wander with flocks.
|  [31:25] For the weary soul I refresh,
|    And each soul that doth pine I replenish.
|  [31:26] Thereupon I awoke and gazed,
|    For my sleep had been sweet unto me.
|  [31:27] Behold, saith Jehovah, the days are coming,
|    When I will sow the households of Israel and Judah
|    With the seed of men and the seed of cattle.
|  [31:28] And as once I was awakeful to pluck them up,
|    To break down, to afflict, overthrow and destroy them,
|  So now I will watch over them (once more,
|    But this time) to build up and to plant, saith Jehovah.
|  [31:29] In those days men shall say no more,
|  "The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
|    And the children’s teeth are on edge;"

[31:30] But each for his own sin shall die.

|  And the man that hath eaten sour grapes
|    Shall find his own teeth set on edge.

#### The New Covenant ####

|  [31:31] Behold the days are coming,
|    When I, saith Jehovah, will make a new covenant
|    With the households of Israel and Judah–
|  [31:32] But unlike the covenant I made with their fathers,
|    The day, when I took their hand in Mine,
|    To bring them out of the land of Egypt–
|  The covenant they themselves did break,
|    So that I, on My part, was constrained to abhor them.
|  [31:33] But this, saith Jehovah, is the covenant I will make
|    With the household of Israel after those days:
|  I will set My law in their bosom,
|    And write it upon their heart,
|  And I will be their God,
|      And they shall be My people.
|  [31:24] No more need any teach
|    His fellow to know Jehovah;
|  For one and all shall know Me,
|    The small and the great alike;
|  For I will pardon their guilt,
|    And their sin will remember no more.

##### Perpetuity of Israel #####

|  [31:35] Thus declareth Jehovah,
|  Who giveth the sun for a light by day,
|    The moon and the stars for a light by night,
|  Who stirreth the sea that the waves thereof roar–
|    Jehovah of Hosts is His name:
|  [31:36] Not until those fixed orbs shall vanish
|    Clean out of My sight, saith Jehovah,
|  Shall Israel’s race cease to be
|    A nation before Me for ever.
|  [31:37] Not till the heavens above can be measured,
|    And earth’s foundations be searched out beneath,
|  Shall I ever cast off the race of Israel
|    For all they have done, saith Jehovah.

##### Expansion of Jerusalem’s Ancient Boundary #####

[31:38] Be assured, saith Jehovah, the days are coming, whenthe city shall again be built up for Jehovah from the

|  [31:39] tower of Hananel to the gate at the corner, and theline of the wall shall pass straight on to the hill Gareb,
|  [31:40] where it will turn round to Goah. Further, the entirevalley (of Hinnom) with its corpses and ashes andthe whole locality as far as the valley of Kidron upto the corner of the horse-gate on the east, shall beconsecrated to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up orthrown down again for ever.

##### The Purchase #####

 [Jeremiah 32] 

[32:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovahin the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which[32:2] was in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At thattime the forces of the king of Babylon were investingJerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined to[32:3] the guard-house of the royal palace, where Zedekiah theking had shut him up on account of his propheticpreaching. "What do you mean," he had demanded,"by an announcement of this kind: ’Thus saithJehovah, Depend upon it, I will give this city into thehands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.[32:4] Nor shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape the hands ofthe Chaldeans; he will assuredly be delivered into thehands of the king of Babylon. He shall speak to him[32:5] face to face, and see him eye to eye; and he shall bringZedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain till I visithim. Though you fight with the Chaldeans you shallhave no success.’"

[32:6] Now there came to Jeremiah the following message[32:7] from Jehovah: "Hanamel, the son of thine uncleShallum, is about to pay thee a visit, to request thee tobuy the land he holds at Anathoth; and he will urgethat, as thou art the next of kin, it is thy privilege and[32:8] duty to receive it." And so it happened: my cousinHanamel paid me in the guard-house the visit Jehovahhad intimated, and said: "I want you to buy the landI possess at Anathoth; for you are the legal heir, andit is your duty to secure it – so buy it for yourself."Then I recognised that the message I had received was[32:9] really from Jehovah. So I bought the land at Anathothfrom my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the money[32:10] to him – seventeen silver shekels. Then I signed thedeed and sealed it, took witnesses, and paid him the[32:11] money in full. I then took the purchase-deed–the one which was sealed and the one which was open–[32:12] and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son ofMachesiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, andof the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deed[32:13] and of all the Jews in the guard-house. In theirpresence I then gave these instructions to Baruch:[32:14] "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Take these deeds – this purchase deed which is sealedand this deed which is open – and put them in anearthenware jar, so that they may be preserved for a[32:15] long time to come. For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,the God of Israel: A time is coming when houses andfields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land."

##### The Prophet’s Prayer #####

[32:16] Now, after I had given the purchase-deed to Baruch,the son of Neriah, I prayed in these words to Jehovah:[32:17] "Ah, Lord Jehovah! Thou, by Thy mighty power andoutstretched arm, hast made the heavens and the earth,[32:18] and nothing is too hard for Thee. Kindness Thoushowest to thousands, and retribution for the guilt ofthe fathers thou bringest home to their children after[32:19] them, Thou great and mighty God, great in purpose andmighty in action, whose eyes are open to all the ways ofmen, giving to each his deserts and the fruit of his deeds.[32:20] In the land of Egypt Thou didst set in Israel andamong (other) men signs and wonders (which arecommemorated) unto this day, and so didst win for[32:21] Thyself the renown that is Thine to-day; and Thoudidst bring Thy people Israel out of the land of Egyptby signs and wonders, with mighty hand out-[32:22] stretched arm and terrors great; and Thou gavest themthis land which Thou didst swear to their fathers togive them – a land flowing with milk and honey – and[32:23] they came in and took possession of it. But they wouldnot listen to Thy voice, nor live in accordance with Thylaw; they have left undone all that Thou didst com-mand them to do; and so Thou hast brought all thismisery upon them.

[32:24] Behold how the siege-mounds for storming the cityare already close upon it, and under the stress ofsword, famine and pestilence, the city is already as goodas given into the hands of the Chaldeans that are assail-ing it. What Thou hast threatened has come, as[32:25] Thou Thyself seest. And it was Thou Thyself, OLord Jehovah, who didst command me to buy the land;(and this I have done), writing and sealing the deedand calling witnesses, though all the while the city isalready as good as delivered into the hands of theChaldeans."

##### The Divine Answer: First, Judgment for Sin #####

[32:26] Then there came to Jeremiah the following message[32:27] from Jehovah: I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is[32:28] there anything too hard for Me? Therefore thus saithJehovah: Behold! I am about to deliver this city intothe hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadrezzar,[32:29] king of Babylon, and he shall take it. Yes, theChaldeans that are assailing this city shall come and setthis city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whoseroofs they have provoked Me by burning sacrifice tothe Baal and by offering drink-offerings to other[32:30] gods; for, ever since their youth the people of Israeland Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight.[32:31] From the day it was built up to this day, this city hasprovoked Me to remove it, in wrath and fury, out of[32:32] My sight, for all the evil that the people of Israel andJudah have wrought to vex Me – themselves, with theirkings, princes, priests and prophets, with the men of[32:33] Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. They haveturned their backs to Me instead of their faces; andthough I taught them early and late, they would never[32:34] listen or accept correction. The very House thatbears My name they have defiled by introducing[32:35] into it their abominable worship. They have builtBaal sanctuaries in the Valley of the son of Hinnomfor the (fiery) consecration of their sons and daughtersto Molech, though this was no commandment ofMine – it never entered into My mind that they shoulddo this abomination, and thus involve Judah in sin.

##### Thereafter, Promise of Restoration #####

[32:36] Now, therefore, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel,concerning the city of which ye say that hunger,famine and pestilence have already as good as delivered[32:37] it into the hands of the king of Babylon: See! I willgather them out of all the lands to which, in My greatwrath, anger, and fury, I have driven them, for I willbring them back to this place and settle them here[32:38] securely; and they shall be My people, and I will be[32:39] their God. A single heart I will give them, and a singleway (will I set before them), that they may hold Mein reverence for ever, and that they and their children[32:40] after them may prosper; and I will make with theman everlasting covenant to follow them ceaselesslywith My blessing, and I will put the fear of Me in theirhearts, that they may follow Me without swerving.[32:41] It will also be a joy to Me to do them good; andfaithfully, with all My heart and soul, I will plant them inthis land.

[32:42] For thus saith Jehovah, As surely as I have broughtupon this people all this mass of misery, so surely will Ibring upon them all the blessings I promise them.[32:43] In this land that ye call a desolation, forsaken of manand beast and delivered into the hands of the Chal-[32:44] deans, fields shall be bought once more. Yes, menshall buy fields for money, subscribing and sealing thedeeds, and taking witnesses, in the district of Benjaminand the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and the cities ofJudah, in the cities of the hill country, the lowland,and the south. For I will restore their fortunes, saithJehovah.

#### Renewed Promises of Restoration ####

##### Jerusalem and Judah will be Pardoned, Restored, Made Glad and Renowned #####

 [Jeremiah 33] 

[33:1] A second message from Jehovah came to Jeremiah[33:2] while he was still confined in the guard-house. Itwas this: Thus saith Jehovah, who created the earthand formed it to stand fast – Jehovah is His name:

[33:3] "Call to Me, and in answer I will tell thee great andhidden things, of which thou art unaware."

[33:4] Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerningthe houses of this city and the royal palaces of Judahwhich have been demolished to make a defence against[33:5] the siege-mounds and the sword. The Chaldeans arecoming to fight and to fill them with the dead bodiesof the men whom I have slain in Mine anger and fury,and whose manifold wickedness has constrained Me[33:6] to hide My face from them. Nevertheless, I will closeup the city’s wounds and heal her completely, and Iwill unveil to them treasures of peace and stability.[33:7] The fortunes of Judah and Israel I will restore; and I[33:8] will build them up as of old. I will cleanse them of allthe guilt of their sin against Me, and I will forgive all[33:9] the guilt of their sin and rebellion against Me. Andshe shall be to Me a source of delight, of praise, and ofglory among all the nations of the earth, when they hearof all the happiness that I shall achieve for them; andthey shall fear and tremble at all the happiness and allthe prosperity that I shall provide for them.

[33:10] Thus saith Jehovah: In this place that you call adesolation, forsaken of man and beast, in the cities ofJudah and on the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate,[33:11] forsaken of man and beast, there shall once again beheard the voice of mirth and gladness, the voice ofbridegroom and bride, the voice of those that say, as theybring their thank-offerings into the House of Jehovah,
|    Give thanks to Jehovah of Hosts,
|    For Jehovah is gracious,
|    His kindness endureth for ever.For I will restore the fortunes of the land, saith[33:12] Jehovah, as in the olden time. Thus saith Jehovah ofHosts: In this place which is desolate, forsaken ofman and beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shallagain be homesteads of shepherds with flocks reclining.[33:13] In the cities of the hill country, the lowland, and thesouth, in the district of Benjamin, the neighbourhood ofJerusalem, and the cities of Judah, flocks shall oncemore file past, to be counted under the hands (of theshepherds), saith Jehovah.

##### Promise of the Ideal King or Messiah #####

[33:14] Mark this, saith Jehovah; the days are coming when I willperform My gracious promise to the households of Israel and[33:15] Judah. In those days and at that timeI will raise up for David a righteous shoot,
|    Who shall execute justice and right in the land.

|  [33:16] In those days shall Judah be crowned with salvation,
|    And Jerusalem in safety shall dwell:
|  And this is the name men shall call her,
|    "Our champion is Jehovah."

##### Promise of the Perpetuity of the Davidic Dynasty and the Levitical Priesthood #####

[33:17] For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit[33:18] upon the throne of the house of Israel; neither shall theLevitical priests ever, for all time to come, want a man tooffer burnt-offerings in My presence or to burn oblations or todo sacrifice.

[33:19] Further, there came to Jeremiah this message from Jehovah,[33:20] Thus saith Jehovah: Not until ye can annul My covenant withDay and Night, so that Day and Night shall come no more at[33:21] their appointed time – not until then shall My covenant beannulled with David My servant, that a son od his should reignupon his throne; or My covenant with the Levitical priests,[33:22] My ministers. Numberless as the host of heaven, measurelessas the sand of the sea, shall I multiply the descendants ofDavid, My servant, and the Levitical priests, My ministers.

[33:23] Jeremiah received this further message from Jehovah: Hast[33:24] thou observed what this people has been saying? They havesaid that Jehovah has cast off the two families of His choice,and in contempt for His people has ordained that they shall no[33:25] longer exist as a nation before Him? Well, thus saithJehovah: As surely as I have created Day and Night and[33:26] determined the order of heaven and earth, so surely will I nevercast off the descendants of Jacob and of David My servant,or fail to select his descendants as rulers over the race ofAbraham, Isaac and Jacob; for I will have compassion uponthem and restore their fortunes.

#### Incidents of the Siege of Jerusalem ####

##### Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah of the Folly of Resisting Babylon #####

 [Jeremiah 34] 

[34:1] This message came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, whenNebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army,and all the kingdoms and nations of the earth thatwere under his dominion were fighting against[34:2] Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah: Thus saithJehovah, the God of Israel, Go to Zedekiah, king ofJudah, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: I amabout to deliver this city into the hands of the king of[34:3] Babylon, who will burn it with fire. As for thee, thoushalt not escape out of his hands: thou wilt assuredlybe seized and into his hands delivered: thou shalt seethe king of Babylon eye to eye, and speak to him face[34:4] to face, and to Babylon thou shalt go. But listen,Zedekiah, king of Judah, to the message of Jehovah:Thus saith Jehovah concerning thee: Thou shalt not[34:5] die by the sword, but thou shalt die in peace. (Sweetspices) shall be burned for thee, as for thine ancerstorsbefore thee, and lamentations shall be made for theewith "Ah! Lord," for I, saith Jehovah, have spokenthe word.

[34:6] Then Jeremiah the prophet delivered this message to[34:7] Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, when the armyof the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem,and all the cities of Judah that were left, and Lachishand Azekah – the only cities of Judah that remained asfortified cities.

##### Dishonest Attitude of the Jews to the Liberation of their #####

Slaves: To be Punished by the Liberation of Disaster upon Themselves

[34:8] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,after the King Zedekiah had covenanted with all the people[34:9] in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty – eachman to set free his Hebrew slave, wether male orfemale, so that no one of Jewish descent should serve[34:10] as slave any longer. Now all the princes and all thepeople kept the covenant they had entered into toliberate their several male and female slaves and totreat them as slaves no longer: they kept it and set[34:11] them free. Afterwards, however, they turned andforced back into slavery the male and female slaveswhom they had liberated.

[34:12] Then there came to Jeremiah this message from[34:13] Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel:When I brought your forefathers out of the land ofEgypt, that house of slavery, I Myself made this[34:14] covenant that at the end of six years they were torelease any Hebrew brother who had sold himself tothem-after six years of service, they were to set himfree: your forefathers, however, would not listen[34:15] or incline their ear to Me. But you have in these daysacted in a very different spirit; you have done whatI desired in each proclaiming liberty to his (enslaved)neighbour; in My presence you made a covenant[34:16] in the House that is called by My name. Now,however, you have turned round and dishonoured Myname by forcing back again into slavery the severalmale and female slaves you had set free to dispose ofthemselves as they would.

[34:17] Therefore thus saith Jehovah: You have disobeyedMy injunction to make a proclamation of liberty, each ofyou to his (enslaved) neighbour. Well, then, saithJehovah: You shall have your proclamation of libertyfrom Me – (liberty) to the sword, pestilence andfamine – and I will make you an object of consternation[34:18] to every kingdom in the world. As for the menthat broke the covenant they had made in My presence,when they passed between the pieces of the calf they[34:19] had cut in two – I mean the princes of Judah andJerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests and all the people ofthe land who passed between the pieces of the calf[34:20] they had cut in two – I will deliver them into the handsof their enemies and of those that seek their life, andtheir dead bodies shall be devoured by the birds of the[34:21] air and the beasts of the earth. Further, Zedekiah,king of Judah, and his princes, I will deliver into thehands of their enemies and of those that seek their life,and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylonwhich (for the moment) has raised the siege and left you.

[34:22] Mark this well, saith Jehovah, I will issue My word ofcommand and bring them back to this city; theyshall assault it and take it and burn it with fire, and thecities of Judah I will turn into an uninhabited desolation.

#### The Fidelity of the Rechabites contrasted with the Disobedience of the Jews ####

 [Jeremiah 35] 

[35:1] In the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king ofJudah, Jeremiah received the following message from[35:2] Jehovah: Go to the clan of the Rechabites, talk withthem, bring them into one of the chambers (of the[35:3] Temple) and offer them wine to drink. So I tookJaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaz-ziniah, with his brothers and all his sons and the whole[35:4] Rechabite clan, and brought them into the Templechamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, the son ofYigdaliah, the man of God, that was adjacent to thechamber of the princes, above the chamber ofMaaseiah, the son of Shallum, the Keeper of the[35:5] Threshold. I then set before the Rechabites bowls[35:6] full of wine and cups and told them to drink. "No,"they said, "we will drink no wine; for Jonadab, theson of Rechab, our ancestor, laid a charge upon us and[35:7] our children to drink no wine, to build no houses, to sowno seed, to plant and possess no vineyard for ever, but tospend all our days in tents, so that we might live long on[35:8] the land where as strangers we dwell. In full obedience,therefore, to this charge of Jonadab, the son of Rechab,our ancestor, we have drunk no wine all our life long,neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our[35:9] daughters. We have built no houses to live in, we[35:10] have owned neither vineyard, field, nor seed, butwe have lived in tents and faithfully fulfilled all the[35:11] instructions of our ancestors Jonadab. It was onlywhen the land was invaded by Nebuchadrezzar, kingof Babylon, that we decided to come to Jerusalem, toescape the Babylonian and Aramean armies; that iswhy we are (now) living in Jerusalem."

[35:12] Then there came to Jeremiah this message from[35:13] Jehovah: "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel:Go and say to the men of Judah and the citizens ofJerusalem: Should this not be a lesson to you to obey[35:14] My words, saith Jehovah? The injunction thatJonadab the son of Rechab laid upon his sons todrink no wine has been steadily observed: in obedienceto that ancestral charge they have abstained to this day.But when I spoke to you early and late, you refused[35:15] to listen. Early and late I sent you all My servants theprophets with the message to each man of you that, ifyou would abandon your wicked ways, amend yourconduct, and no longer indulge in the service of othergods, you should continue in the land that I gave yourforefathers; but you would not incline your ear or[35:16] listen to Me. Unlike the descendants of Jonadab theson of Rechab, who have steadily observed the in-junctions of their ancestor, this people has refused to[35:17] listen to Me. Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,the God of Israel: See! I am about to bring uponJudah and upon all the citizens of Jerusalem all themisery with which I have threatened them, becausethey refused to listen to My words or respond to My[35:18] call." But to the clan of the Rechabites Jeremiah said,"Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:Because you have obeyed the injunction of yourancestor Jonadab, keeping all his commandments and[35:19] fulfiling all his instructions, Jonadab, the son of Rechabshall never want a man to minister to Me, while theearth stands.

#### Jeremiah’s Prophecies Committed to Writing, Publicly Read in the Temple, ####
and Contemptuously Burned by King Jehoiakim

 [Jeremiah 36] 

[36:1] In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah,king of Judah, Jeremiah received the following message[36:2] from Jehovah: Take a book-roll, and write on it allthe messages I have communicated to thee with regardto Israel and Judah and all nations, from My firstmessage to thee in the days of Josiah right on to the[36:3] present day. It may be that, when the people ofJudah hear of all the misery I am planning to bringupon them, they will severally abandon their wickedways, and receive at My hands pardon for their guiltand sin.

[36:4] Then Jeremiah summoned Baruch, the son of Neriah,who wrote down on a book-roll to Jeremiah’s dic-tation all the messages Jehovah had communicated to[36:5] him. Thereafter Jeremiah gave instructions toBaruch in the following terms: "Seeing that I ampersonally under restraint and debarred from access[36:6] to the Temple, do you go and, on the day appointedfor fasting, read aloud in the Temple the messages ofJehovah in the hearing of the people from the rollwhich you have written to my dictation; read themalso in the hearing of the Judeans who come from their[36:7] respective country towns. It may be that they willhumbly supplicate Jehovah, and severally abandontheir wicked ways: for great is the anger and fury[36:8] with which Jehovah has threatened this people." Inaccordance, therefore with his instructions fromJeremiah the prophet, Baruch read aloud from thebook the words of Jehovah in the Temple.

[36:9] Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakimthe son of Josiah, king of Judah, a sacred fast wasproclaimed by all the people resident in Jerusalem,and all those also present from the country towns of[36:10] Judah. Then in the hearing of all the people Baruchread from the book the messages of Jeremiah from theroom that belonged to Gemariah, the son of Shaphanthe Secretary of State, which was situated in the upper[36:11] court at the entrance to the new Temple gate. Nowwhen Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son ofShaphan, had heard the messages of Jehovah as they[36:12] were read from the book, he went down to the palaceto the room of the Secretary of State, and there he foundthe whole court seated – Elishama, the Secretary andDelaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elanthan, theson of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, andZedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and indeed the whole[36:13] court. Micaiah proceeded to inform them of all thewords he had heard Baruch read out of the book in the[36:14] hearing of the people. The whole court accordinglydespatched a messenger to Baruch, namely one Jehudi,the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son ofCushi, with instructions to Baruch to appear, bring-ing with him the roll from which he had read in thehearing of the people. So Baruch, the son of Neriah,appeared before them with the roll in his hand.

[36:15] Then they told him to sit down and read it in their[36:16] hearing; so Baruch read while they listened. Whenthey had heard it all, they turned to one another inconsternation, exclaiming to Baruch that they were[36:17] bound to inform the king of all this. They thenasked Baruch to explain how he had written all these[36:18] words. Baruch replied that Jeremiah had dictatedthem all to him, and he had written them down with[36:19] ink in the book. "Well, then," said the princes toBaruch, "go into hiding, you and Jeremiah, and let[36:20] nobody know where you are." After they haddeposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama theSecretary, they visited the king in his apartment,and reported the whole matter to him.

[36:21] The king then despatched Jehudi to fetch the roll;and, when he had brought it form Elishama’s chamber,he read it in the hearing of the king and of all the[36:22] courtiers who were in attendance upon him. Nowthe king was sitting in the winter house, and the[36:23] fire on the brazier was burning before him; andevery three or four columns that Jehudi read, the kingwould cut up with his penknife and fling into the firethat was on the brazier, till the whole roll was con-[36:24] sumed in the fire that was on the brazier. But therewas no sense of horror either on the part of the kingor of any of his ministers as they listened to all these[36:25] words, nor did they rend their garments. Elnathan,Delaiah, and Gemariah, however, had entreated theking not to burn the roll, but he would not listen to[36:26] them. Then the king commanded the royal princeJerachmeel, and seraiah, the son of Azriel, andShelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribeand Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah kept them inconcealment.

[36:27] After the king had burned the roll containing thewords written by Baruch to Jeremiah’s dictation,[36:28] Jeremiah received this message from Jehovah, "Oncemore take another roll, and write on it all the wordsthat were on the first roll that was consigned to the[36:29] flames by Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Thus saithJehovah: Thou hast taken it upon thee to burn thisroll and to demand my reason for recording the threatthat the king of Babylon would assuredly come and[36:30] destroy this land, and clear it of man and beast. There-fore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king ofJudah: Never a man shall he have to sit upon thethrone of David; his dead body shall be flung out and[36:31] exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night. Iwill punish him, his descendants, and his ministers, fortheir sins; and I will bring upon them and upon thecitizens of Jerusalem all the misery with which Ithreatened them in vain."

[36:32] Then Jeremiah took another roll and gave it toBaruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on itto Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the book thathad been burned by Jehoiakim; and it was supple-mented by many messages of a similar kind.

##### Experiences of Jeremiah During the Siege and at the Capture of Jerusalem #####

#### Jeremiah Warns King Zedekiah of the Impending Fate of Jerusalem ####

 [Jeremiah 37] 

[37:1] Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah was reigning in placeof Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, having been set uponthe throne of Judah by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Baby-[37:2] lon; but neither he nor his ministers nor the peopleof the land gave any heed to the messages Jehovah[37:3] had delivered by the prophet Jeremiah. KingZedekiah, however, sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah,and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest toJeremiah, with the request that he would pray for[37:4] them to Jehovah their God. Now Jeremiah, who hadnot yet been put in prison, was still coming andgoing among the people.

[37:5] The Chaledeans who were engaged in the siege ofJerusalem, having received a report that Pharaoh’sarmy was advancing from Egypt, abandoned the siege.[37:6] Then there came to Jeremiah this message from[37:7] Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah: Tell the king ofJudah who hath sent thee to consult Me, thatPharaoh’s army which is advancing to your aid[37:8] shall return to Egypt to their own land; and theChaldeans will come back and assault this city[37:9] and take it and burn it with fire. Thus saith Jehovah:Do not delude yourselves with the idea that the Chal-deans will leave you for good: they will do nothing of[37:10] the kind. For even if you defeated the wholeChaldean army that is fighting against you, so com-pletely that the only survivors were wounded men – aman to a tent– even they would rise up and burn thiscity with fire.

#### Jeremiah Arrested and Imprisoned ####

[37:11] When, in view of the advance of Pharoah’s army,the Chaldean forces had abandoned the siege of[37:12] Jerusalem, Jeremiah made a journey from Jerusalemto the district of Benjamin to receive his inheritance[37:13] among the people. He had just reached the Benjamingate when he was apprehended there by a sentrynamed Jirijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son ofHananiah, who called out, "You are deserting to the[37:14] Chaldeans." "It is false, said Jeremiah, "I amnot deserting to the Chaldeans." But Jirijah, refusingto listen, apprehended Jeremiah and brought him[37:15] before the courtiers, who in their exasperation hadJeremiah flogged and put in the house of Jonathan,the Secretary of State, which they had turned into a[37:16] prison. So Jeremiah found himself in the cells of thedungeon, where he remained for a considerable time.

[37:17] Then King Zedekiah sent for him and questionedhim secretly in his house whether there was any com-munication from Jehovah. "There is," said Jeremiah;"you will be delivered into the hands of the king of[37:18] Babylon. Further," said Jeremiah to the king,"what is my crime against you or your ministers or[37:19] this people that you have put me in prison? Whereare your prophets (now) that assured you that the king[37:20] of Babylon would never invade this country? Andnow I beseech your Majesty to listen with favour to mysupplication, and not to allow me to be taken backto the house of Jonathan the Secretary, where I am[37:21] likely to perish." Jeremiah was accordingly committedby royal command to the guard-court, and furnishedwith a loaf of bread a day from the Baker’s Street, tillall the bread in the city was consumed. So Jeremiahremained in the guard-court.

#### Jeremiah Accused of Treason, is Put into a Dungeon, from which he is ####
Rescued by Ebedmelech, a Foreigner

 [Jeremiah 38] 

[38:1] Now Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, theson of Pashhur, and Juca, the son of Shelemiah, andPashhur, the son of Malchiah, ahd heard Jeremiah[38:2] addressing all the people in words like these: "Thussaith Jehovah: Whoever remains in this city shall dieby sword, famine and perstilence; but whoever goesover to the Chaldeans shall be spared, though he shall[38:3] escape with nothing but his life." Also, "Thus saithJehovah, This city shall most assuredly be deliveredinto the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, and[38:4] it shall be captured." Whereupon those courtierssaid to the king, "We petition you to have this fellowput to death: this sort of talk is unnerving all thepeople and the soldiers left in the city. This fellow[38:5] does not want to help the city, but to ruin it." "Heis in your power," said the king; for he was helpless[38:6] against them. So they took Jeremiah and, loweringhim with ropes, they threw him into the cistern of theroyal prince Malchiah, that was in the guard-court.There was no water in the cistern, but only mud;and Jeremiah sank in the mud.

[38:7] Now it came to the ears of Ebedmelech, an Ethiopianeunuch attached to the palace, that they had put[38:8] Jeremiah in the cistern. Ebedmelech accordingly leftthe palace for the Benjamin gate where the kinghappened to be sitting at the time, and thus he[38:9] addressed him: "Your Majesty, these men havebehaved most wrongfully in their treatment of Jeremiahthe prophet; they have flung him into the cistern andhe will die of hunger on the spot, for there is no more[38:10] bread in the city." At once the king orderedEbedmelech to take with him three me and pullJeremiah out of the cistern before he perished.[38:11] Ebedmelech, accordingly, taking the men with him,went to the palace, and secured form (a lumber room)underneath the treasury some torn and tattered rags,and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah into the[38:12] cistern. Then he told Jeremiah to put the torn andtattered rags under his armpits beneath the ropes;[38:13] and Jeremiah did so. Then they drew him up with theropes and pulled him out of the cistern; and Jeremiahremained in the guard-court.

#### Zedekiah Secretly Consults Jeremiah ####

[38:14] King Zedekiah afterwards sent and had Jeremiahbrought to him at the third entry that leads into theTemple; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am goingto ask you a question which you are to answer me[38:15] unreservedly." "If I tell you," said Jeremiah, "areyou not certain to put me to death? besides, any advice[38:16] I give you, you will simply disregard." Then, in secret,the king swore the following oath to Jeremiah, "AsJehovah liveth, who created this life of ours, I assureyou solemnly that I will neither put you to death nordeliver you into the hands of those men that are seek-[38:17] ing your life." Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah,"Thus saith Jehovah, If you surrender voluntarily tothe officers of the king of Babylon, your life will bespared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, but[38:18] you and your family will be spared. If, however, yourefuse to surrender, then this city shall be deliveredinto the handso of the Chaldeans, who will burn it withfire; and you shall not escape from their hands."[38:19] Then the king said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of theJews who have gone over to them and subjected to violence."[38:20] "No," said Jeremiah, "you will not be handed over.But I entreat you to listen to what I say – it is thevoice of Jehovah: your happiness and your life depend[38:21] upon it. But if you refuse to surrender, then this isthe message revealed to me in a vision by Jehovah[38:22] –mark it well; (I saw) all the women that are left inthe palace of the king of Judah brought out to the chiefofficers of the king of Babylon, chanting the while thissong:

|  Thy most excellent friends have beguiled
|    And prevailed over thee,
|  Thy feet they have thrust in the mire,
|    And thus sinking have left thee.

[38:23] All your wives and children they shall bring out tothe Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape; youwill be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon; andthis city shall be burned with fire."

[38:24] "Well, then," said the king to him, "let nobodyknow anything of this conversation, or else you are a dead[38:25] man. If the courtiers hear that I have been talkingwith you, and come and ask you to tell them un-reservedly, on pain of death, what you have been saying[38:26] to the king and the king to you, then just tell them thatyou were presenting a petition to the king that youshould not be taken back to Jonathan’s house, where[38:27] you were in danger of perishing." In point of fact, thecourtiers did all come to Jeremiah and question him;and the story he told them was in entire accordancewith the king’s instructions. So they said no more tohim, for no part of the conversation had been heard.[38:28a] Jeremiah accordingly remained in the guard-courttill the day Jerusalem was taken.

#### Provision made for Jeremiah’s safety after the Capture of Jerusalem ####

[38:28b] When Jerusalem was taken, all the chief officers of

 [Jeremiah 39] 

[39:3] the king of Babylon came and took their seatsin the middle gate – Nergalsharezer the Rab-mag,Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and all the rest of the[39:14] Officers of the king of Babylon. They sent and hadJeremiah brought from the guard-court, and deliveredhim to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son ofShaphan, to be taken to his own home; so he stayedamong the people.

#### The Capture of Jerusalem ####

[39:1] In the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah,king of Judah, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon camewith all his forces against Jerusalem and laid siege to[39:2] it. On the ninth day of the fourth month of theeleventh year of Zedekiah a breach was made in the[39:4] city. On observing this, Zedekiah, king of Judah, andall the soldiers took to flight, leaving the city during thenight by way of the royal garden, by the gate betweenthe two walls, and they made for the Jordan valley.[39:5] But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtookZedekiah in the steppes of Jericho. They seized himand brought him to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath, and he[39:6] pronounced judgment upon them. At Riblah theking of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before hiseyes, and all the noblemen of Judah also did the king[39:7] of Babylon slay. He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes,and loaded him with chains to carry him to Babylon.[39:8] The palace and the houses of the people the Chaldeansburned with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem they[39:9] demolished. The rest of the people that were left in thecity, and the deserters who had gonve over to him, andthose that werer left of the artificers, Nebuzaradan, thecommander of the guard, carried to exile in Babylon.[39:10] Some of the poor people who had nothing were left byNebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, in the landof Judah, and presented at the same time with vine-yards and fields.

[39:11] With regard to Jeremiah, Nebuchadrezzar, king ofBabylon, had instructed Nebuzardan, the commander[39:12] of the guard, to do him no harm, but to take and lookwell afer him and treat him according to his own[39:13] instructions. So a messenger was despatched fromNebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, andNebuzaradan, the Rab-saris, and Nergalsharezer, theRab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king ofBabylon.

#### Jeremiah’s Gracious Promise to Ebedmelech ####

[39:15] During Jeremiah’s detention in the guard-court,there had come to him this message from Jehovah:[39:16] Go and say to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: I will bring uponthis city all that I have said – for evil and not for good,and in that day it will be accomplished before thine[39:17] eyes. But, saith Jehovah, I will deliver thee on thatday, and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the[39:18] men thou dreadest. I will save thee without fail;thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thou shalt escapewith thy life, because, saith Jehovah, thou hast putthy trust in Me.

##### Experiences of Jeremiah After the Capture of Jerusalem #####

#### Jeremiah Elects to Remain in Palestine ####

 [Jeremiah 40] 

[40:1] The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovahafter he had been released from Ramah by Nebuzar-adan, the commander of the guard, who had found himthere in chains among the captives of Jerusalem andJudah, who were being carried to exile in Babylon.

[40:2] The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and saidto him: "Jehovah, your God, pronounced this doom[40:3] upon this place, and He has kept His word. Youhave sinned against Him and refused to listen to His[40:4] voice, and so this thing is come upon you. But see now,I will release you at once from the chains on your hands.If you are disposed to accompany me to Babyloncome and I will look well after you; but if not, thenleave it alone. The whole land is before you; go[40:5] wherever you choose and prefer. Go back to Gedaliah,the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the kingof Babylon has appointed Governor of the cities ofJudah: stay with him among the people or go whereveryou choose." Then the commander of the guarddismissed him with a gift of provisions and a present.[40:6] So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah at Mizpah, where hestayed with him among the people left in the land.

#### Assassination of Gedaliah the Governor of Judah ####

[40:7] When all the commanders of the forces in the openfield, together with their men, heard that the king ofBabylon had appointed Gedaliah Governor of the land,and charged him with the oversight of the men, womenand children, and of the poorest of the land, such as[40:8] had not been carried to exile in Babylon, they camewith their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah – Ishmael theson of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons ofKareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons ofEphai of Netophah, and Jezaniah, the son of the[40:9] Maacathite. And Gedaliah gave his oath to them andtheir men: "Don’t be afraid," he said, "of theChaldean officials. You will prosper if you stay in the[40:10] land and serve the king of Babylon. As for myself,I will reside at Mizpah, to represent your interestswhen the Chaldean (officials) visit us; and you cangather wine, fruit, and oil, and store them up and live[40:11] in the towns you take possession of." Further, all theJews that were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, or elsewhere,when they heard that the king of Babylon had grantedpermission to some to remain in Judah and had ap-[40:12] pointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Governor, theyall returned to Judah from all the places to which theyhad been driven – to Gedaliah at Mizpah – and theygathered immense stores of wine and fruit.

[40:13] Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the com-manders of the forces in the open field came to Gedaliah[40:14] at Mizpah, and asked him whether he was awarethat Baalis king of Ammon had sent Ishmael the son ofNethaniah to assasiante him. But Gedaliah would[40:15] not believe it. Then Johanan, in a secret audience withGedaliah at Mizpah, said to him: "I beseech you toallow me to go and slay Ishmael. Nobody need know.Why should he take your life? that will mean thescattering of all the Jews that have gathered round[40:16] you, and the ruin of all that is left of Judah." "No,"said Gedaliah to Johanan, "do nothing of the kind:what you say of Ishmael is not true."

 [Jeremiah 41] 

[41:1] In the seventh month, however, Ishamael, the sonof Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, a member of theroyal family, accompanied by one of the chief officers ofthe king and ten (other) men, paid a visit to Gedaliah[41:2] at Mizpah. While they were all dining together there,Ishmael and the ten men who accompanied him roseand with the sword smote and slew Gedaliah, whom theking of Babylon had appointed Governor of the land,[41:3] together with all the Jews who were with him inMizpah and all the Chaldean soldiers who happenedto be there.

#### Murder of Pilgrims and Flight of Gedaliah’s Assasin ####

[41:4] The day after the murder of Gedaliah, of which no[41:5] one was yet aware, eighty pilgrims from Shechem,Shiloh, and Samaria, with beards shaven, clothes rentand gashes (on their bodies), came with vegetable offer-ings and frankincense in their hand to present them at[41:6] the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went out from Mizpahto meet them, and they were weeping as they wentalong. When he meet them, he invited them to come to[41:7] Gedaliah; but when they were well within the town,he and the men who accompanied him slew them at[41:8] the cistern. Ten of their number, however, entreatedIshmael not to kill them: "for we have stores ofwheat," they said, "and barley, oil, and honey, buriedin the ground." So he let them alone and did not[41:9] consign them to the doom of their brethren. Nowthe cistern into which Ishmael had cast all the corpsesof the men he had slain was the great cistern whichhad been constructed by king Asa in his war againstBaasha, king of Israel; and this Ishmael filled with theslain.

[41:10] Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of thepeople that were at Mizpah, the princesses and all thepeople left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the com-mander of the guard, had committed to the charge ofGedaliah, the son of Ahikam; and he started across to[41:11] Ammon. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, andall the commanders of the forces that were with him,[41:12] heard of all the atrocities perpetrated by Ishmael, theytook all their men and set out to attack him; and they[41:13a] found him by the great waters of Gibeon. All the[41:14a] people with Ishmael – all that he had carried captive[41:13b] from Mizpah – when they saw Johanan and the com-manders of the forces that were with him, were filled[41:14b] with joy; and turning about, they came back and[41:15] joined Johanan. But Ishmael, escaping with eightmen, repaired to Ammon.

[41:16] Then Johanan and all the commanders of the forcesthat were with him, tool all the rest of the people whomIshmael had carried away captive from Mizpah, afterhis assassination of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam – men,women, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from[41:17] Gibeon. Then they took their journey and stayedawhile at the sheepfolds of Chimham in the neighbour-hood of Bethlehem, from which they intended to[41:18] travel to Egypt; for they were in terror of theChaldeans, because Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah,whom the king of Babylon had appointed Governor ofthe land.

#### Migration of the Jews to Egypt in Defiance of Jeremiah’s Counsel ####

 [Jeremiah 42] 

[42:1] Then all the commanders of the forces, togetherwith Johanan, and Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and[42:2] all the people great and small, approached Jeremiahthe prophet with a petition, which they commended tohis most favourable consideration, that he would prayfor them, remnant as they were, to Jehovah his God."We are left," they said, "but a few out of many, as[42:3] you see with your own eyes. Let Jehovah your Godtell us the way we should go and the things we should do."[42:4] Jeremiah replied, "I have heard you; I promise topray to Jehovah our God, as you request; and what-ever be Jehovah’s answer I will tell you unreservedly."[42:5] Whereupon they said to Jeremiah, "Jehovah be ourtrue and faithful Witness that we will act entirely inaccordance with any message that Jehovah your God[42:6] may send us. We have sent you to Jehovah our God;and, be it welcome or unwelcome, we will obey Hisvoice, and so enjoy the prosperity that comes fromobedience to the voice of Jehovah our God."

[42:7] After an interval of ten days, Jeremiah received a[42:8] message from Jehovah. He accordingly summonedJohanan and all the commanders of the forces thatwere with him, and all the people, small and great,[42:9] and thus he addressed them. "Thus saith Jehovah,the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your[42:10] supplication: If you remain quitely in this land, I willbuild you up and not throw you down; I will plant youand not pluck you up: for I am grieved at the misery[42:11] I have brought upon you. You are afraid of the king ofBabylon, but do not be afraid of him, saith Jehovah;do not be afraid of him, for I will be with you, to save[42:12] you and to deliver you from his hand. I will havepity upon you and inspire him with pity for you, sothat he will allow you to remain in your own land.[42:13] You may, however, disregard the voice of Jehovah your[42:14] God, and refuse to remain in this land: you may say,’No; we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shallsee no war and hear no sound of trumpet and neversuffer for lack of bread – and there we shall make our[42:15] home.’ In that case I call upon you that are left ofJudah to listen to the message of Jehovah. Thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you are reallydetermined to proceed to Egypt, and if you go and settle[42:16] there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake youthere in the land of Egypt, and the hunger that youdread shall cling to your heels there in Egypt, and there[42:17] ye shall die; and all the men that were determinedto go and settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, famine,and pestilence; not one shall survive or escape the dis-[42:18] aster that I will bring upon them. For thus saithJehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine angerand fury have been poured out upon the inhabitants ofJerusalem, so shall My fury be poured out upon youwhen ye enter Egypt; and ye shall be an object ofexecration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and yeshall see this place no more.

[42:19] This is Jehovah’s message to you that are left ofJudah: ’Do not go to Egypt.’ But now be very sure[42:20] of this – I this day lay witness against you; you havedone yourselves a grievous wrong. You have sentme to Jehovah your God with the request that I shouldpray for you to Jehovah, and promising to act inentire accordance with the will of Jehovah when I[42:21] declared it to you; but when I did declare it this day,you refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah in respect[42:22] of any part of my commission. Now therefore be verysure of this, that ye shall die by the sword, famine,and pestilence, in the land where it is your desire togo and settle."

 [Jeremiah 43] 

[43:1] When Jeremiah had finished addressing to theassembled people all these words with which Jehovah[43:2] had commissioned him, Azariah, the son of Hoshaniah,and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the defiant andinsolent men exclaimed to Jeremiah, "You are a liar;you have no commission to us from Jehovah to warn[43:3] us against going and settling in Egypt; but it is Baruchthe son of Neriah who is setting you on against us withthe object of delivering us into the hands of theChaldeans, to be killed or transported to Babylon."[43:4] So Johanan and all the commanders of the forces andall the people refused to listen to the voice of Jehovahwhich urged them to remain in the land of Judah.[43:5] Accordingly Johanan and all the commanders of theforces took all that were now left of Judah – those thathad come back from all the nations to which they had[43:6] been driven, to settle in the land of Judah – the men,the women, the princesses, and all the persons whomNebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had leftin the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the sonof Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch[43:7] the son of Neriah; and, disregarding the voice ofJehovah, they went to Egypt and arrived at Daphnae.

#### Jeremiah Predicts the Conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadrezzar ####

[43:8] In Daphnae Jeremiah received the following message[43:9] from Jehovah: "Take large stones in thy hand andhide them away in secret at the porch of Pharaoh’sresidence in Daphnae in the presence of a few of the[43:10] men of Judah, and say to them, Thus saith Jehovah:Mark this well – I will send and bring Nebuchadrezzarthe king of Babylon My servant, who shall set histhrone above these stones thou hast buried and spread[43:11] his glistening tapestry over them. He shall come andsmite the land of Egypt, devoting to death thosedoomed to death, to captivity those doomed to captivity,[43:12] to the sword those doomed to the sword. He shallkindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, he shallclear the land of Egypt, as a shepherd clears his mantleof vermin, and then he shall depart from it in comfort.[43:13] Also he will shatter the obelisks of Bethshemesh, in theland of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt hewill burn with fire.

#### Jeremiah Denounces the Jews in Egypt for their Idolatrous Worship of the Queen of Heaven ####

 [Jeremiah 44] 

[44:1] Concerning all the Jews whose home was in Egypt–at Migdol, Daphnae, Memphis, and in upper Egypt–[44:2] Jeremiah received the following message: "Thussaith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Ye haveseen with your own eyes all the misery that I havewrought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities ofJudah. Ye see what they are to-day – desolate and[44:3] uninhabited – as a consequence of their wicked be-haviour which provoked Mine indignation; for theywent and burned sacrifice in the service of other gods,unknown alike to them or to you or your forefathers;[44:4] and that, though early and late I had been sending to youMy servants the prophets to warn you against these[44:5] abominable practices that I detest. But they refusedto listen or incline their ear: they would no abandon[44:6] their wickedness or cease sacrificing to other gods. Andso Mine anger and fury were poured forth: it blazed inthe cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, sothat they became the waste and the desolation thatthey are to-day.

[44:7] Now, therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts,the God of Israel: Why are ye doing yourselves thisgreat wrong, which can only end in the utter extermin-ation of Judah, man and woman, child and babe?[44:8] Why are ye vexing Me with the fabrications of yourhands, burning sacrifice to other gods in the land ofEgypt, where ye have come to settle? All thiscan only end in your extermination and in your beingcursed and scorned by every nation in the world.[44:9] Have you forgotten the crimes of your forefathers andof the kings and princes of Judah, the crimes, too,your own wives committed in the land of Judah and on[44:10] the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they haveremained unhumbled and unafraid. They have notlived in accordance with My law or with the statutesI set before you and your forefathers.[44:11] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God ofIsrael: Mark this – I will set My face against you for[44:12] Evil, to exterminate Judah utterly. I will take theremnant of Judah that were determined to come andsettle in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Egyptthey shall all be consumed; they shall fall by the swordand by famine; small and great, they shall die by thesword and by famine, and they shall be an object of[44:13] execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and,as I have punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, andpestilence, so will I punish those that have made Egypt[44:14] their home, that not a man of the remnant of Judahwhich has come to settel in Egypt shall escape orsurvive to return to the land of Egypt for whichthey shall yearn; for none but a fugitive or twoshall return."

[44:15] Then the great gathering, composed of all the menwho were aware that their wives burned sacrifice toother gods, and all the women that were standing by,[44:16] replied to Jeremiah thus: "We refuse to listen to thismessage of yours that you have communicated to us in[44:17] the name of Jehovah: but we will most assuredlykeep our solemn oath to burn sacrifice to the Queenof Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in herhonour as we used to do – we and our fathers, ourkings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and on thestreets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we[44:18] lived well and were untouched by misfortune. Butever since the day we ceased burning sacrifice to theQueen of Heaven and pouring out drink-offerings inher honour, we have been utterly destitute, and sword[44:19] and famine have consumed us. Yes," said the women,"as for our offering of sacrifice to the Queen of Heavenand pouring out drink-offerings in her honour – havewe not had the approval of our husbands in making cakesfor her stamped with her image, and in pouring herout drink-offerings?"

[44:20] Such was the answer of all the people, men andwomen. Then Jeremiah addressed them as follows:[44:21] "Yes, you did indeed burn your sacrifices in the cities ofJudah and on the streets of Jerusalem – you and yourfathers, your kings and your princes and commons;and is it not precisely this that rankled in the mind and[44:22] heart of Jehovah, till He could bear your wicked andabominable conduct no longer, with the result that yourcountry is become the uninhabited desolation, the[44:23] horror, the curse that it is to-day? It is because youhave offered such sacrifces, sinning against Jehovah, dis-obeying the voice of Jehovah, refusing to live inaccordance with His laws. His statutes, His expressedwill: that is why the misery of to-day is come uponyou."

[44:24] Further, Jeremiah said to the people and the womenassembled: "Listen to the message of Jehovah, all ye[44:25] Jews that are in the land of Egypt. Thus saith Jehovahof Hosts, the God of Israel: Verily you womenhave indeed carried out your solemn resolve faithfullyto perform the vows you have taken upon you, to burnsacrifice to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in her honour. Well, then, keep your word[44:26] and perform your vows. But listen now to the world ofJehovah, all ye Jews who have made Egypt your home.Mark this well: I have sworn, saith Jehovah, by Mygreat name, that never again in all the land of Egyptshall My name be uttered by the lips of any man ofJudah in the oath ’As truly as the Lord Jehovah[44:27] liveth.’ Mark! I am watching over them for eviland not for good; and every man of Judah in theland of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by[44:28] famine, until there be an end of them. Some whoescape the sword in Egypt shall return to Judah, butthey shall be few in number; and then all the remnantof Judah that have some to settle in Egypt shall knowwhose word it is that stands – Mine or theirs.

[44:29] And this, saith Jehovah, shall be to you the signthat I will punish you in this place, to teach you thatMy threats of disaster shall be confirmed upon you.[44:30] Thus saith Jehovah: I will give Pharaoh Hophra, kingof Egypt, into the hands of his enemies and of those thatseek his life, as I gave Zedekiah, king of Judah, intothe hands of Nebuchadrezzar. king of Babylon, hisenemy that sought his life."

#### Words of Mingled Rebuke and Promise Addressed to Baruch ####

 [Jeremiah 45] 

[45:1] This is the message that Jeremiah the prophetdelivered to Baruch the son of Neriah, after he hadwritten these words in a book to Jeremiah’s dictationin the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king[45:2] of Judah. "This, Baruch, is the message to thee fromJehovah, the God of Israel.[45:3] Thou hast said, ’Woe is me! for Jehovah
|    to my pain hath added sorrow;

|  With groaning I am weary,
|    And I have found no rest.’

[45:4] Let this be thy message to him, Thus saith Jehovah:When I must destroy what I built,
|    And when I must uproot what I planted,

[45:5] Shalt thou seek great things for thyself?
|    Seek them not; for, behold, I will bring

|    Nor the strong man escape:
|  North by the banks of Euphrates
|    They stumble and fall.
|  [46:7] Who is that rose up like the Nile,
|    Whose waters toss like floods?
|  [46:8] It is Egypt that rose like the Nile,
|    Whose waters toll like floods.
|  " I will rise, I will cover the earth,
|    And destroy," said he, "her inhabitants.
|  [46:9] Up, steeds; rage, ye chariots;
|    And forth, ye warriors, march–
|  Cush and Put, that handle the shield,
|    And ye Ludim, that bend the bow."
|  [46:10] But that day is the Lord Jehovah’s–
|    A day of revenge on His foes,
|  When the sword shall devour to its fill,
|    And be drunken with their blood.
|  For Jehovah of Hosts hath a sacrifice
|    In the northern land, by Euphrates.
|  [46:11] Up to Gilead, fetch thee balsam.
|    O virgin daughter of Egypt;
|  In vain dost thou multiply medicines,
|    No healing is there for thee.
|  [46:12] The nations have heard thy wail,
|    And the earth is full of thy cry;
|  For warrior stumbles on warrior,
|    Both are fallen together.
|  [46:13] The message of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, that
|  Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and
|  smite the land of Egypt.
|  [46:14] Tell it Migdol,
|    Publish it in Memphis:
|  Say, "Take thy stand and prepare,
|    For the sword hath devoured round about thee."
|  [46:15] Wherefore is Apus fled?
|    Thy mighty one held not his ground,
|    Because down he was thrust by Jehovah.
|  [46:16] The strangers amonf thee are fallen,
|    And prostate, they say each to other,
|  "Let us flee from the muderous sword,
|    Let us rise and go back to our people,
|    To the land wherein we were born."
|  [46:17] Call Pharaoh of Egypt "Blusterer,
|    Who hath let ht hour go by."
|  [46:18] As live, saith the King, whose name
|    Is Jehovah of Hosts: One shall come
|  Like Tabor among the mountains,
|    Or Carmel by the sea.
|  [46:19] O daughter that dwellest in Egypt,
|    Prepare thee to go into exile;
|  For Noph is become like a desert,
|    An uninhabited waste.
|  [46:20] A graceful heifer is Egypt,
|    But a wasp from the north hath assailed her.
|  [46:21e] For the day of disaster hath reached her,
|    [46:f] The time of her visitation.
|  [46:a] The warriors, too, that she hired,
|    [46:b] Were like unto fatted calves:
|  [46:c] As for them, together they turned
|    [46:d] And fled, without making a stand.
|  [46:22a] She hisseth like a serpent
|    [46:b] Against the advancing hosts;
|  [46:23c] For more are they than locusts,
|    [46:d] So many they cannot be counted.
|  [46:22c] Against her they come with axes,
|    Like men that hew down trees,
|  [46:23a] "Fell, saith Jehovah, "her forest,
|    [46:b] For it is impenetrable,"
|  [46:24] Put to shame is the daughter of Egypt,
|    To men from the north given over.
|  [46:25] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    The God of Israel:
|  See! Amon of Thebes I will punish,
|    And Pharaoh and those that trust him;
|  [46:26] An I will deliver them over
|    To those that seek their life,
|  To the hands of Nebuchadrezzar,
|    King of Babylon, and his servants.
|  But afterwards she shall be peopled
|    As in days of old, saith Jehovah.
|  [46:27] So fear them not, O Jacob My Servant;
|    O Israel, be not dismayed, saith Jehovah.
|  For see! I will save both thee and thine offspring
|    From the far distant land where captive ye lie.
|  And Jacob once more shall have quite and ease
|  In his own land, with no one to make him afraid;
|  [46:28] So fear thou not, O Jacob My Servant,
|    For I, saith Jehovah, am with thee (to save thee).
|  An end I will make of the nations–
|    Of each, among whom I have driven thee;
|  But of thee I will not make an end.
|    I will not leave wholly unpunished,
|    But in measure I will chastise thee.

#### Oracle on the Philistines ####

 [Jeremiah 47] 

[47:1] The message concerning the Philistines whichJeremiah the prophet received from Jehovah, beforePharaoh smote Gaza. Thus saith Jehovah:

|  [47:2] From the north, see! waters are rising,
|    They swell to a raging torrent:
|  They will sweep o’er the land and its fulness,
|    The city and (all) her inhabitants.
|  Men shall utter a cry,
|    Those that dwell in the land shall howl.
|  [47:3] At the noise of the hoofs of his galloping steeds,
|    At the rush of his chariots, the roar of his wheels,
|  The father shall not look behind for the children;
|    For all unnerved shall they be–
|  [47:4] Because of the day of destruction
|    That cometh on all the Philistines,
|  Sweeping from Tyre and Sidon
|    All helpers that yet remain;
|  For Jehovah shall work destruction
|    On all that are left in the coast-land.
|  [47:5] Baldness is come upon Gaza,
|    Ashkelon is destroyed.
|  O ye that are left of the Anakim,
|    How long must ye gash yourselves yet?
|  [47:6] "Ah! Sword of Jehovah!
|    How long will it be ere thou rest?
|  Into thy scabbard get thee,
|    And keep thee quiet and still."
|  [47:7] But how can it be quiet,
|    Since Jehovah hath given it a charge?
|  He hath destined it for Ashkelon,
|    And for the shore washed by the sea.

#### Oracle on Moab ####

 [Jeremiah 48] 

|  [48:1] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:
|  Alas for the ruin of Nebo!
|    Kiriathaim is taken,
|    Misgab is shamed and dismayed.
|  [48:2] The renown of Moab is vanished,
|    In Heshbon they plotted her ruin:
|  "Come, let us blot out the nation;
|  Thou, Madmen, shalt be silenced,
|    The sword shall follow thee hard."
|  [48:3] Hark! a shriek from Horonaim–
|    Havoc and fell destruction.
|  [48:4] Moab is destroyed,
|    The shriek can be heard far as Zoar,
|  [48:5] They climb the ascent to Luhith,
|    Weeping the while as they go;
|  For the path that leads down to Horonaim
|    Is ringing with cries of destruction.
|  [48:6] Fly, escape for your lives,
|    Though like bare desert shrub shall ye be.
|  [48:7] Thou hast trusted in thy strongholds,
|    And therefore art thou taken:
|  Chemosh shall pass into exile,
|    His priests and his princes together.
|  [48:8] Upon every city the spoiler shall come,
|    No city shall escape;
|  The valleys shall also perish,
|    And the table-land be destroyed,
|    In accord with the word of Jehovah.
|  [48:9] Give ye wings unto Moab,
|    For fain would she fly away
|  From her cities that shll be desolate
|    And empty altogether.
|  [48:10] Cursed be he that doeth
|    The work of Jehovah remissly;
|  And cursed be he that keepeth
|    His sword from (shedding) blood.
|  [48:11] From his youth Moab been at ease,
|    On his lees he hath quitely rested–
|  Not emptied from vessel to vessel,
|    Nor ever to exile borne;
|  so his taste remaineth in him,
|    And his scent is all unchanged.
|  [48:12] Therefore days, saith Jehovah, are coming,
|    When tilters I will send;
|  And they shall tilt him over
|    And empty out his vessels,
|    And dash his jars in pieces.
|  [48:13] And the hopes of Moab in Chemosh
|    Shall be utterly disappointed,
|  As Israel was disappointed,
|    In Bethel, wherein she trusted.
|  [48:14] How can ye claim to be heroes
|    And mighty men of war,
|  [48:15] When the spoiler of Moab is come up against her,
|    And the flower of her youth is gone down to the slaughter?
|    Saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.
|  [48:16] The ruin of Moab is night at hand,
|    Her misery hasteth swiftly.
|  [48:17] Bemoan her, all ye her neighbours,
|    All ye that know her name:
|  say, "How is the strong staff broken,
|    The rod that was so fair!"
|  [48:18] Come down from thy splendour and sit in the mire,
|    Thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon;
|  For the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee,
|    Thy fortress he hath destroyed.
|  [48:19] Stand by the way and spy,
|    O thou that dwellest in Aroer;
|  Ask of the fugitive men
|    And the women that flee, "What hath chanced?"
|  [48:20] "Moab is put to shame:
|    She is broken; howl ye and cry."
|  [48:21] Tell it by the Arnon that Moab is laid waste. Judg-
|    ment is come upon the table-land – upon Holon,
|  [48:22] Jahzah, and Mephaath, upon Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-
|  [48:23] diblathaim, upon Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-
|  [48:24] meon, upon Keriyyoth and Bozrah, and all the citiesof the land of Moab, far and near.
|  [48:25] Hewn off is the horn of Moab,
|    And her arm is broken, saith Jehovah.
|  [48:26] Make ye her drunken, for she
|    Hath been insolent towards Jehovah.
|  Yeah, Moab hath clapped her hands,
|    And in turn shall she, too, be derided.

[48:27] For didst thou hold Israel in derision? Hathshe then been detected in the company of thieves, thatthou shakest thy head so, every time thou speakest ofher?

|  [48:28] Leave the cities and dwell in the crags,
|    Ye inhabitants of Moab;
|  And be like to the dove that nesteth
|    In the holes of the rocks of the precipice.
|  [48:29] We have heard of the pride of Moab–
|    How very proud is she–
|  of her crafty and arrogant pride,
|    And the haughtiness of her heart.
|  [48:30] Well I know her arrogance,
|    The falseness of her boasting,
|    And the falseness of her behaviour.
|  [48:31] There shall therfore be wailing in Moab,
|    Yea, shrieks from all quarters of Moab,
|    And moans for the men of Kir-heres.
|  [48:32] For thee, O vine of Sibmah,
|    Shall be weeping as men weep for Jazer.
|  Thy branches passed over the sea,
|    They reached as far as Jazer;
|  On thy summmer fruits and their vintage
|    Is the despoiler fallen.
|  [48:33] Gladness and mirth are vanished
|    From Moab’s garden-land;
|  No wine is trod in the presses,
|    The merry shout I have stilled,
|    And the shout that is raised is of battle.
|  [48:34] Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
|    And their voice doth reach unto Jahaz,
|  From Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyyah;
|    For the waters of Nimrim shall also be desolate.
|  [48:25] I will cause, saith Jehovah, to vanish from Moab
|    Him that offereth in the high place,
|    And doth sacrifice to his god.
|  [48:36] So my heart like a flute maketh moaning for Moab,
|    My heart maketh moan for the men of Kir-heres;
|    For the gain they had gotten is perished.
|  [48:37] For every head is bald,
|    And every beard is clipped:
|  On every hand are gashes,
|    On every loin is sackcloth.
|  [48:38] On Moab’s roofs and squares
|    Is universal wailing;
|  For Moab I have shattered
|    Like a vessel that one despiseth.
|  [48:39] How broken is Moab! howl ye.
|    How she turneth her back in shame!
|  Her neighbours shall all behold her
|    With horror and derision.
|  [48:40] For thus saith Jehovah, Behold,
|  One like a vulture shall swoop,
|    And spread out his swings against Moab.
|  [48:41] Keriyyoth is taken, the strongholds are seized.
|  That day shall the heart of the warriors of Moab
|    Be like to the heart of a woman in anguish.
|  [48:42] As a nation, Moab shall perish
|    For his insolence towards Jehovah.
|  [48:43] Trap, terror, and pit are before you,
|    All ye that dwell in Moab.
|  [48:44] He that flies from the terror shall fall down the pit,
|    He that creeps from the pit shall be caught in the trap.
|  Yea, this I will bring upon Moab
|    In the year of her visitation.
|  [48:45] In the shadow of Heshbon stand fugitives–
|    All their strength now gone;
|  For a fire is gone forth from Heshbon,
|    A flame from the house of Sihon,
|  Devouring the temples of Moab’s head,
|    And the crown of the head of the sons of tumult.
|  [48:46] Woe unto thee, O Moab!
|    The people of Chemosh is perished;
|  Thy sons are taken captive,
|    Thy daughters are led to captivity.
|  Yet Moab I will restore.
|    In the latter days, saith Jehovah.
|  Thus far is the judgment upon Moab.

#### Oracle on Ammon ####

 [Jeremiah 49] 

|  [49:1] Thus saith Jehovah:
|  Hath Israel no sons, no heirs?
|    Why then hath Milcom seized Gad,
|    And his people inhabit her cities?
|  [49:2] Therefore days, saith Jehovah, are coming,
|    When over Rabbah of Ammon
|    I will bring the alarum of war.
|  A desolate mound shall she be,
|    And with fire shall her daughters be burned;
|  And Israel shall hold once more
|    The land from which she was driven.
|  [49:3] Howl, ye children of Ammon,
|    Your capital is ruined;
|  And cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
|    Gird you with sackcloth and wail,
|    And wander about in mourning;
|  For Milcom is gone into exile,
|    His priests and his princes together,
|  [49:4] Why gloriest thou in thy valley,
|    Thou daughter that livest at ease;
|  And trustest in thy reserves,
|    Thinking no one shall ever assail thee.
|  [49:5] Behold, I will bring on thee terror,
|    Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts,
|    From all that are round about thee;
|  Ye shall all be driven headlong,
|    And the wanderers none shall rally.
|  [49:6] But afterwards, saith Jehovah,
|    The Ammonites I will restore.

#### Oracle on Edom ####

|  [49:7] On Edom.
|  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|    Is wisdom no more in Teman?
|  Is the wit of the prudent perished,
|    Their wisdom vanished clean?
|  [49:8] Turn, fly to retreats inaccessible,
|    Ye that dwell in Dedan;
|  For I bring upon Esau his doom,
|    The time of his visitation.
|  [49:9] Gleaners are come upon thee,
|    Who will leave not a grape to glean;
|  Yea, thieves in the night are come,
|    Who will wreck to their heart’s content.
|  [49:10] For I have stripped Esau bare,
|    And his lurking-place uncovered,
|    So that hide himself he cannot.
|  Destroyed is he to a man
|    By the arm of his brethen and neighbours.
|  [49:11] Leave thine orphans, and I will preserve them;
|    Let thy widows trust in Me.

[49:12] For thus saith Jehovah: If those who did notdeserve to drink the cup must drink it nevertheless,how canst thou expect to go utterly unpunished?Nay, verily, thou shalt no escape, but drink it thou

|  [49:13] shalt. For I have most solemnly sworn, saith Jehovah,that Bozrah shall be a horror, a scorn, and a curse,and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.
|  [49:14] Jehovah hath sent me tidings
|    Of an envoy despatched to the nations,
|  To bid them gather against her,
|    And rise up to do battle.
|  [49:15] For small in the eyes of the nations,
|    Yea, scorned among men, will I make thee.
|  [49:16] O how thou then wilt shudder!
|    The pride of thy heart hath beguiled thee,
|  Thou that hauntest the clefts of the crags,
|    That holdest the heights of the hills.
|  Though thou buildest thine eyrie as high as the eagle,
|    Even thence to the ground will I bring thee.
|  [49:17] And Edom shall be a horror;
|    Yea, horror-struck, all that pass by her
|    Shall hiss at her many wounds.
|  [49:18] As when Sodom was overthrown,
|    And Gomorrah and her neighbours,
|  No man shall dwell therein,
|    No mortal shall sojourn there.
|  [49:19] Behold, as a lion comes up
|    To the pastures of sheep from the jungle of Jordan,
|  Even so will I chase them away, in a moment,
|    And visit with vengeance their choicest rams.
|  Who is like Me? who will challenge Me?
|    What shepherd is there that will face Me?
|  [49:20] Therefore hear what Jehovah hath planned against Edom,
|    And purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
|  The young shepherd lads shall be dragged away,
|    And their homestead assuredly smitten with horror.
|  [49:21] At the sound of their fall the earth doth tremble,
|    And far as the Red Sea their cry shall be heard.
|  [49:22] See! one like a vulture shall swoop,
|    And spread out his wings against Bozrah.
|  That day shall the heart of the warriors of Edom
|    Be like to the heart of a woman in anguish.

#### Oracle on Damascus ####

|  [49:23] Hamath and Arpad are shamed,
|    For tidings of evil hath reached them;
|  They melt for very care,
|    They are restless, like the sea.
|  [49:24] Damascus is all unstrung,
|    She betaketh herself to flight.
|  Trembling hath seized upon her,
|    Anguish hath taken hold of her,
|    And sorrow like that of a woman in travail.
|  [49:25] How forlon is the famous city,
|    The city of wondrous charm!
|  [49:26] In her squares shall her young men lie fallen;
|    Her warriors all shall be silenced

|    And the palaces of Benhadad it shall devour.

[49:28] On Kedar and the kingdom of Hazor, whichNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote.Thus saith Jehovah:Arise, get ye up unto Kedar,
|    Despoil the sons of the East,

|  [49:29] Their tents and their flocks shall be taken,
|    Their hangings and all their vessels;
|  (The foe) shall seize their camels,
|    And shout at them "Terrors encircle you."
|  [49:30] Turn, fly to retreats inaccessible,
|    Ye that dwell in Hazor;
|  For Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon
|    Hath purposed and planned to destroy you.
|  [49:31] "Arise and assail the nation
|    That liveth in ease and security,
|  Strangers to gates and bars,
|    And dwelling apart by themselves."
|  [49:32] Their camels shall fall a prey,
|    And the throng of their herds shall be plundered;
|  And those whose temples are clipped
|    I will scatter to all the winds;
|  And I, saith Jehovah, will bring on them
|    Ruin from every side.
|  [49:33] A haunt of jackals shall Hazor become,
|    A perpetual desolation:
|  No man shall dwell therein,
|    No mortal shall sojourn there.

|  [49:35] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|  I will break the bow of Elam,
|    Chief weapon of their might.
|  [49:36] I will bring four winds upon them
|    From the four ends of the heavens,
|    And to all these winds will I scatter them.
|  No nation shall there be
|    Where the outcasts of Elam shall come not.
|  [49:37] I will fill them with dismay
|    In the presence of their foes
|    And of those that seek their life.
|  And I will bring evil upon them,
|    My glowing indignation;
|  I will send the sword to pursue them,
|    Until I have consumed them.
|  [49:38] I will set My throne in Elam,
|    And thence will I destroy
|    The king and the princes together.
|  But Elam I will restore
|    In the latter days, saith Jehovah.

#### Oracle on Babylon ####

 [Jeremiah 50] 

[50:1] The message concerning Babylon and the land of theChaldeans that Jehovah communicated to Jeremiahthe prophet.

|  [50:2] Tell ye the nations and publish it,
|    Publish it unreservedly,
|  That Babylon is taken,
|    Bel shamed, and Marduk dismayed.
|  Her images are shamed,
|    Her idol-blocks are dismayed;
|  [50:3] For a folk from the north hath assailed her
|    That shall desolate her land,
|  So that none may dwell therein–
|    Man, beast, are fled and gone.
|  [50:4] In those days, at the time, saith Jehovah,
|    The children of Israel shall come
|    With the children of Judah together;
|  They shall go on their way with weeping,
|    And seek Jehovah their God.
|  [50:5] For Zion shall they ask,
|    With faces hitherward turned,
|  Saying, "Come, let us join Jehovah
|    In a covenant everlasting,
|  That never shall be forgotten."
|  [50:6] Lost sheep have My people been,
|    Their shepherds have led them astray,
|    They have turned them away on the mountains;
|  From mountain to hill they have wandered,
|    Forgetful of the fold.
|  [50:7] All have devoured them that found them:
|    Their enemies said "We are guiltless"–
|  For they had offended Jehovah,
|    The Fold, where righteousness dwelleth,
|    Jehovah, the Hope of their fathers.
|  [50:8] Flee ye from Babylon’s midst,
|    Get ye out from the land of Chaldea,
|    Like he-goats before the flock.
|  [50:9] For behold! I will rouse against Babylon
|    A swarm of northern nations,
|  That shall set their array against her,
|    Until they have overcome her.
|  They shall shoot like a skilful warrior,
|    Who doth not return empty.
|  [50:10] Chaldea shall be despoiled,
|    All that spoil her shall have their fill.
|  [50:11] Though ye rejoice and be glad,
|    O ye that plunder My heritage;
|  Though ye gambol like calves in the grass,
|    And neigh like stalwart horses;
|  [50:12] Your mother shall deeply be shamed,
|    And abashed shall she be that bore you–
|  The hindermost of the nations,
|    A wilderness dry and desert,
|  [50:13] An empty desolation,
|    Because of the wrath of Jehovah.
|  Horror-struck, all that pass by her
|    Shall hiss at her many wounds.
|  [50:14] Set your array round Babylon,
|    All ye that bend the bow;
|  Shoot your arrows at her without stint,
|    She hath sinned against Jehovah.
|  [50:15] Encirlce her with your war-cry,
|    Already she hath surrendered;
|  Her buttresses are fallen,
|    Her walls are torn down.
|  ’Tis the vengeance of Jehovah:
|    Avenge yourselves upon her,
|    Do to her as she hath done.
|  [50:16] Root out of Babylon him that soweth,
|    And him that wieldeth the sickle in harvest.
|  To escape the murderous sword
|    Shall each set his face to his people,
|    And each to his own land flee.
|  [50:17] A scattered flock is Israel,
|    By lions driven away.
|  First, the king of Assyria devoured him,
|    And now at the last his bones
|    Have been gnawed by the king of Babylon.
|  [50:18] Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    The God of Israel: Behold,
|  I will punish the king and the land of Babylon,
|    As I punished the king of Assyria.
|  [50:19] But Israel I will bring back to his homestead,
|    To pasture on Carmel and Bashan;
|  On Ephraim’s hills and in Gilead
|    He shall fare to his heart’s content.
|  [50:20] In those days, at that time, saith Jehovah,
|    Though Israel should be searched,
|  No guilt shall in her be found;
|    And no transgression in Judah
|  Shall any man discover:
|    For those whom I spare I will pardon.
|  [50:21] Get ye up to the land of Marrati,
|    And the people that dwell in Pekod;
|  Slay and destroy them utterly,
|    And do all I command, saith Jehovah.
|  [50:22] Hark! the alarum of war,
|    In Chaldea fell destrucion.
|  How is she hewn and shattered–
|    The Hammer of all the earth.
|  What a horror among the nations
|    Is Babylon become!
|  [50:24] I sanred thee, and thou hast been taken,
|    O Babylon, unaware:
|  Thou art discovered and caught,
|    Because thou hast challenged Jehovah.
|  [50:25] Jehovah has opened His armoury,
|    And brought forth His weapons of wrath;
|  For the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,
|    Hath a work to do in Chaldea.
|  [50:26] Assail her from every quarter,
|    Lay her granaries bare;
|  Pile her up like heaps of corn,
|    And utterly detroy her;
|    Let nothing of her be left.
|  [50:27] Slay ye all her bullocks,
|    Down let them go to the slaughter.
|  Woe unto them: for their day is come,
|    The time of their visitation.
|  [50:28] Hark! how they flee, they escape
|    Away from the land of Babylon
|  To Zion, to tell how Jehovah,
|    Our God, hath avenged His Temple.
|  [50:29] Call against Babylon archers,
|    All those that bend the bow;
|  Camp round about against her,
|    Let none of them escape.
|  Requite her for all she hath done,
|    And deal with her as she dealt,
|  For her insolence towards Jehovah,
|    The Holy One of Israel.
|  [50:30] In her squares shall her young men lie fallen,
|    Her warriors all shall be silenced,
|    In that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts.
|  [50:31] See, Insolence, I will assail thee,
|    Saith the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts;
|  Because thy day is come,
|    The time of thy visitation.
|  [50:32] Then shall Insolence stumble and fall,
|    And none shall lift her up;
|  I will kindle a fire in her forest,
|    Which shall all her thickets devour.
|  [50:33] Thus saith Jehovah of Host:
|  The children of Israel are crushed,
|    And the children of Judah together;
|  Their captors hold them fast
|    And refuse to let them go.
|  [50:34] But mighty is their Redeemer;
|    Jehovah of Hosts is His name.
|  He will surely defend their cause,
|    That He may give rest to the earth,
|    And disquiet the people of Babylon.
|  [50:35] A sword upon the Chaldeans,
|    Upon all the people of Babylon,
|    Her princess and her wise men!
|  [50:36] A sword upon her diviners!
|    And then shall their folly be manifest.
|  A sword upon her warriors!
|    And then how dismayed shall they be!
|  [50:37] A sword on her horses and chariots,
|    And on all the strange folk in her midst!
|    And they shall become as women.
|  A sword upon her treasures!
|    And plundered shall they be.
|  [50:38] A sword upon her waters!
|    And dried up shall they be!
|  For she is a land of images,
|    And with hideous (idols) they make themselves mad.
|  [50:39] So wild cats and wolves shall dwell there,
|    And there shall ostriches dwell;
|  She shall not be re-peopled for ever,
|    Or dwelt in through all generations.
|  [50:40] As when Sodom was overthrown,
|    Gomorrah and her neighbours,
|  No man shall dwell therein,
|    No mortal shall sojourn there.
|  [50:41] See! a pople doth come from the north:
|    A great nation and many kings
|    From the ends of the earth bestir them
|  [50:42] Bow they wield and javelin–
|    Cruel and pitiless they,
|  With a voice like the roar of the sea,
|    And they upon horses come riding,
|  Arrayed, like one man, for the battle,
|    Against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
|  [50:43] The rumour of them hath come
|    To the ears of the king of Babylon,
|    And he is all unstrung;
|  Anguish hath seized upon him
|    And pangs as of woman in travail.
|  [50:44] Behold, as a lion comes up
|    To the pastures of sheep from the jungle of Jordan,
|  Even so will I chase them away in a moment,
|    And visit with vengeance their choicest rams.
|  Wh is like Me? Who will challenge Me?
|    What shepherd is there that will face Me?

[50:45] Therefore hear what Jehovah hath planned against Babylon,
|    And purposed against those that dwell in Chaldea:

|  The young shepherd lads shall be dragged away,
|    And their homestead assuredly stricken with horror.
|  [50:46] At the shout, " She is taken," the earth doth tremble,
|    And over the world their cry shall be heard.

 [Jeremiah 51] 

|  [51:1] Thus saith Jehovah:
|    Behold, I will raise against Babylon
|  And those that dwell in Chaldea
|    The spirit of a destroyer.
|  [51:2] I will send upon Babylon winnowers
|    Who shall winnow and empty her land :
|  Yea, woe shall beset her about
|    In the day of her disaster.
|  [51:3] Let the archer bend his bow,
|    Stand erect in his coat of mail;
|  Not one of her young men spare,
|    But destroy her whole host utterly.
|  [51:4] Let them fall down slain in the land of Chaldea,
|    And stabbed upon her streets.
|  [51:5c] For their land is full of guilt
|    [51:d] Against the Holy One of Israel;
|  [51:a] But Israel and Judah were not forsaken
|    [51:b] By their God, Jehovah of Hosts.
|  [51:6] Fly from the midst of Babylon,
|    Save every man his life,
|    Lest her guilt bring destruction upon you.
|  ’Tis Jehovah’s day of revenge,
|    With a recompense He is requiting her.
|  [51:7] A golden cup is Babylon,
|    That made the whole earth drunken:
|  The nations drank of her wine,
|    And therefore are they gone mad.
|  [51:8] On a sudden she falls, she is shattered,
|    Raise ye your wail over her;
|  Take balsam for her pain,
|    Peradventure she may be healed.
|  [51:9] We strove for Babylon’s healing,
|    But past all healing was she;
|  And so we now will leave her,
|    And each to his own land go;
|  For her judgement reacheth to heaven,
|    It mounts to the very clouds.
|  [51:10] Jehovah hath shown that the right was ours:
|    Come, let us tell in Zion
|    What Jehovah our God hath done.
|  [51:11] Polish the arrows,
|    Furbish the shields;
|  For Jehovah hath stirred up
|    The spirit of Media’s king.
|  He hath planned for the ruin of Babylon;
|    For such is Jehovah’s vengeance,
|    The vengeance for His Temple.
|  [51:12] Hoist ye the flag for the march
|    Against the walls of Babylon;
|  Strengthen the watch, set watchmen,
|    And get the ambush ready:
|  For Jehovah hath planned and accomplished
|    His treats on the people of Babylon.
|  [51:13] Thou that art rich in treasure,
|    And dwellest by many waters,
|  Thine end is come, thy web is spun.
|    [51:14] Jehovah of Hosts hath most solemnly sworn:
|  " I will fill thee with men who will swarm like locusts
|    And lift up against thee a shout of triumph.
|  [51:15] He created the earth by His power,
|    He established the world by His wisdom,
|    He stretched out the heavens by His skill.
|  [51:16] When He uttereth His voice,
|    The waters roar in the heavens,
|  And He causeth vapours to rise
|    From the uttermost ends of the earth.
|  Lightings He made for the rain,
|    And the wind He brings out if His storehouses.
|  [51:17] How foolish is man with his knowledge!
|    The goldsmith is shamed by his image;
|  His idols are a delusion,
|    And breath in them is none.
|  [51:18] They are an empty mockery,
|    In the hour of their trial they shall perish.
|  [51:19] Not such is the Portion of Jacob,
|    His God is the Framer of all things;
|    Jehovah of Hosts is His name.
|  [51:20] My hammer of war hast thou been,
|    With thee I have shattered the nations.
|  With thee have I kingdoms destroyed,
|  [51:21] With thee horse and rider I shattered,
|    And chariot and charioteer;
|  [51:22] With thee man and woman I shattered,
|    With thee old and young have I shattered,
|  With thee youth and maid have I shattered,
|    [51:23] With thee flock and shepherd I shattered,
|  With thee team and ploughman I shattered,
|    With thee lord and viceroy I shattered.
|  [51:24] And Babylon I will requite,
|    And the people of all Chaldea,
|  Before your eyes, saith Jehovah,
|    For the wrong they have wrought upon Zion,
|  [51:25] Behold, I will assail thee,
|    Saith Jehovah, thou mount of destruction,
|    That destroyest all the earth;
|  I will stretch out My hand against thee,
|    And make thee a burning mountain.
|  [51:26] No corner-stones shalt thou furnish,
|    And no foundation stones;
|  But thou, saith Jehovah, shalt be
|    A perpetual desolation.
|  [51:27] Raise a banner upon the earth,
|    Blow the trumpet among the nations;
|  Prepare the nations against her,
|    Summon against her the kingdoms
|    Of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
|  Muster your troops against her,
|    And bring up horses like locusts.
|  [51:28] Prepare the nations against her,
|    King, lords, and viceroys of Media,
|    And all the land that he ruleth.
|  [51:29] The earth is in tremor and anguish,
|    For Jehovah’s design against Babylon standeth–
|  To make the land of Babylon
|    An uninhabited waste.
|  [51:30] The warriors of Babylon cease fight,
|    They stay within their fastnesses;
|  Their strength is all dried up,
|    They are become like women.
|  Her dwelling-places are burned,
|    Her bars are shattered to pieces.
|  [51:31] Courier runs to meet courier,
|    And messenger to meet messenger,
|  To tell the king of Babylon
|    That on all sides his city is taken.
|  [51:32] The ferries have been seized,
|    The defences areburned with fire,
|    And the men of war are confounded.
|  [51:33] For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,
|    The God of Israel:
|  The daughter of Babylon is now
|    Like a threshing-floor, when it is trodden;
|  But yet a little while–
|    And for her shall the harvest-time come.
|  [51:34] Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,
|    Hath done me violent wrong:
|  He hath left me an empty vessel,
|    He hath swallowed me up like a monster;
|  He hath filled his maw with my dainties,
|    And then hath cast me out.
|  [51:35] Let her that inhabiteth Zion declare,
|    "The wrong done to me and my flesh be on Babylon!"
|  Let Jerusalem say, "My blood
|    Be on them that dwell in Chaldea!"
|  [51:36] Thus therefore saith Jehovah:
|  See! I will defend thy cause,
|    And I will take vengeance for thee;
|  Her sea I will dry up,
|    And her fountain I will wither.
|  [51:37] Babylon shall become a ruin,
|    A place that jackals haunt,
|  A place of horror and hissing,
|    A place where no man dwelleth.
|  [51:38] They roar like young lions together,
|    They growl like lions’ whelps;
|  [51:39] I will give them the banquet they crave for,
|    And make them drunk, that they swoon,
|  And sleep their eternal sleep,
|    To awake nevermore, saith Jehovah.
|  [51:40] I will bring them down to the slaughter,
|    Like the lambs or rams with goats.
|  [51:41] How is Sheshach seized and taken,
|    That was famous all over the world!
|  With what horror all the nations
|    Are smitten at Babylon’s fate!
|  [51:42] The sea came up upon Babylon,
|    ’Neath the roar of her billows she sank.
|  [51:43] Her cities were turned to a waste,
|    A dry and desert land:
|  In then shall no man dwell,
|    No mortal shall ever pass through them.
|  [51:44] I will punish Bel in Babylon,
|    And make him disgorge what he swallowed.
|  No more shall the nations stream to him;
|    The wall of Babylon is fallen.
|  [51:45] Forth from her midst, My people,
|    Save every man his life
|    From the glowing wrath of Jehovah.
|  [51:46] See that ye faint not nor fear
|    At the rumours ye hear in the land,
|  When one year one rumour cometh,
|    And in the next another,
|  And tyrant after tyrant
|    Doeth violence in the earth.
|  [51:47] See therefore, the days are coming,
|    When I will punish the idols of Babylon,
|  And put her whole land to shame,
|    And all shall fall slain in the midst of her.
|  [51:48] The heavens shall rejoice over Babylon,
|    The earth, and all therein;
|  For spoilers shall come from the north
|    And assail her, saith Jehovah.
|  [51:49] Yes, Babylon must fall
|    For Israel’s sons that are slain,
|  As for Babylon are fallen
|    The slain of all the earth.
|  [51:50] Ye that the sword have escaped,
|    Depart ye, stand not still:
|  Remember Jehovah afar,
|    And bethink ye of Jerusalem.
|  [51:51] "We are shamed, we have heard a reproach,
|    And confusion hath covered our faces;
|  For strangers are entered in
|    To the Holy House of Jehovah."
|  [51:52] See therefore, the days are coming
|    When her images I will punish,
|    And all through her land shall the wounded groan.
|  [51:53] Though Babylon mounted to heaven,
|    And there in the heights built her fortress,
|  Yet from me should despoilers come
|    And assail her, saith Jehovah.
|  [51:54] Hark! ’tis a shriek from Babylon,
|    Fell destruction in Chaldea,
|  [51:55] For Jehovah despoileth Babylon,
|    He stilleth her mighty voice.
|  They shall roar like many waters,
|    And utter their clamorous din;
|  [51:56] For the spoiler is come upon Babylon;
|    Her mighty men are taken,
|    Their bows are broken in pieces:
|  For Jehovah is a God of requitals,
|    And He will repay without fail.
|  [51:57] Her princes I will make drunken,
|    Her wise men and her governors,
|  Her viceroys and her warriors;
|    They shall sleep their eternal sleep,
|  To awake nevermore, saith the King,
|    Whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.
|  [51:58] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:
|  Babylon’s broad wall shall be razed to the ground,
|    And her towering gates in the fire shall be burned:
|  Thus endeth the toil of the peoples in nothing,
|    The labour of nations is doomed to the flames.

#### Jeremiah’s Message to Babylon, Symbolic of her Doom ####

[51:59] The instructions given by Jeremiah the prophet toSeraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, whoacted as quester-master, when he accompaniedZedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth[51:60] Year of his reign. Now Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll[51:61] all the misery that was to come upon Babylon; andhe said to Seraiah, "When you arrive at Babylon, see[51:62] that you read all these words, and say: ’Thine, OJehovah, are these words; it is Thou that hast decreedthe destruction of this place – that never again shall itbe a home for man or beast, but that it shall remain a[51:63] desolation for ever.’ When you have finished readingthis scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle[51:64] of the Euphrates, with the words: ’Thus shall Babylonsink, to rise no more, because of all the misery that Ishall bring upon her.’"

Here end the words of Jeremiah.

#### The Capture of Jerusalem and the Exile of the People ####

 [Jeremiah 52] 

[52:1] Zedekiah, who was twenty-one years of age when hecame to the throne, reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.His mother’s name was Hamutal, a daughter of[52:2] Jeremiah of Libnah. His actions were offensive to[52:3] Jehovah was so angry with Jerusalem and Judah thatHe cast them out of His sight; and Zedekiah revoltedagainst the king of Babylon.

[52:4] On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninthyear of his reign Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,came with all his forces to storm Jerusalem. Theypitched their camp against it, and surrounded it with[52:5] a siege-wall; so the city was undersiege till the eleventh[52:6] year of king Zedekiah. In the ninth day of the fourthmonth – the famine in the city being so severe that[52:7] there was no bread for the people of the land – abreach was made in the city, and all the soldiers tookto flight, leaving the city during the night by way of thegate between the two walls by the royal garden–the city being surrounded by the Chaldeans – and they[52:8] made for the Jordan valley. But the Chaldean armypursued the king and overtook him in the steppes ofJericho, all his own army having left him and scattered.[52:9] They seized the king and brought him to the king ofBabylon who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath;[52:10] and he pronounced judgment upon him. At Riblahthe king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah beforehis eyes, and all the princes of Judah did he also slay;[52:11] he then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and having loaded himwith chains, he carried him to Babylon, where he kepthim in the House of Discipline till the day of his death.

[52:12] On the tenth day of the fifth month of the nineteenthyear of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, one of theministers of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem;[52:13] and he proceeded to burn the Temple, the palace, and[52:14] indeed every house in Jerusalem. All the walls thatencircled Jerusalem were demolished by the Chaldeanforces that were under the commander of the guard.[52:15] The rest of the people left in the city, and the deserterswho had gone over the king of Babylon, and thosethat were left of the artificers, were carried into exile by[52:16] Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard. Some ofthe poorest of the country people were left by Nebuzar-adan, the commander of the guard, to act as vine-dressers and ploughmen.

[52:17] The bronze pillars of the Temple, and the stands,and the bronze sea that was in the Temple, were brokenin pieces by the Chaldeans, and all the bronze of them[52:18] was taken to Babylon. They also took the pots andthe shovels and the snuffers and the basons and thepans and all the bronze vessels used in the (Temple)[52:19] service. The goblets and the snuff-dishes (for thelamps) and the basons and the pots and the lamp-stands and the pans and the libation bowls – whateverwas of gold or silver respectively – were removed by the[52:20] commander of the guard: – the pillars, two; the seaone; and the bronze bulls that supported the sea,twelve; and the stands which King Solomon hadmade for the Temple, ten; – vessels the mass of whose[52:21] bronze was beyond weight. Each of the pillars wastwenty-seven feet in height, eighteen feet in circum-ference, three inches in thickness, and hollow within.[52:22] It was surmounted by a bronze capital, seven feet and ahalf in height, round which ran network and pome-granates of bronze throughout; the (network and)[52:23] pomogranate adorment of both pillars was alike. Onthe network round about there were a hundred pome-granates in all, of which ninety-six were visible.

[52:24] The commander of the guard also took Seraiah thechief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the[52:25] three keepers of the threshold. He took also from thecity a eunuch who had charge of the soldiers, and sevenof the King’s Privy Councillors who were found inthe city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief,who kept the army register, and sixty of the people of[52:26] the land whom he found within the city. Havingseized them, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard,brought them to Riblah to the king of Babylon;[52:27] and the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblahin the district of Hamath. Thus was Judah carriedfrom her own land into exile.

[52:28] These are the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carriedinto exile; in the seventeenth year (of his reign)[52:29] three thousand and twenty-three Jews; in the eight-eenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, eight hundred and[52:30] thirty-two persons from Jerusalem; in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan thecommander of the guard carried seven hundred andforty-five Jews into exile: – in all, four thousandsix hundred.

#### A Gleam of Light in the Darkness of Exile ####

[52:31] In the thirty seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin,king of Judah, in the twenty-fifth day of the twelfthmonth, Evil-merodach, in the year of his accession tothe throne of Babylon, restored Jehoiachin, king of[52:32] Judah, to favour, liberated him from prison, engagedhim in friendly intercourse, and gave him precedenceover the (other) kings who were (detained) with him[52:33] in Babylon. He also changed his prison dress, and he[52:34] dined at the royal table to the very end of his life. Aperpetual allowance, which was disbursed daily, wasassigned him by the king of Babylon, and he continuedto enjoy it all his life up to the day that he died.

#### Lament over the Sorrows of Jerusalem ####

##### Her Comfortless Doom #####

 [Lamentations 1] 

|  [1:1] Alas! How lonely the city
|    Once crowded with people.
|  She that was great among nations
|    Is now as a widow.
|  She that was queen of the provinces
|    Now is a vassal.
|  [1:2] Sore, sore she weeps in the night;
|    There are tears on her cheecks.
|  Now there is no one to comfort
|    Of all those that loved her.
|  All her friends have proved faithless,
|    And turned to be foes.
|  [1:3] From sorrow and toil into exile
|    Hath Judah departed;
|  And now is her home with the hearthen,
|    And no rest she findeth.
|  In the midst of her straits her pursuers
|    Have all overtaken her.
|  [1:4] The highways to Zion lie mourning,
|    For pilgrims are none.
|  All desolate now are her gates,
|    And her priest are in sorrow.
|  Her virgins are dragged away far;
|    She herself is in bitterness.
|  [1:5] Supreme her foes are now,
|    And her enemies triumph.
|  The Lord hath afflicted her sore
|    For her manifold sins.
|  Gone are her little once captive
|    In front of the foe.
|  [1:6] The glory is vanished clean
|    From the daughter of Zion.
|  Her princes are like unto harts
|    That can nowhere find pasture;
|  All feeble they move on their way
|    With pursuers behind them.
|  [1:7] Jerusalem calleth to mind
|    The days of her travail,
|  When into the hands of the foemen
|    Her people fell helpless.
|  The mocking foe feasted his eyes
|    On her sore desolation.
|  [1:8] Jerusalem hath grievously sinned,
|    And so she hath fallen.
|  All they that honoured despise her
|    At sight of her nakedness.
|  She meanwhile groaneth and moaneth
|    And turneth her backward.
|  [1:9] Her filthiness clung to her skirts;
|    She became all abhorrent.
|  To the future she gave not a thought,
|    So her fall was appalling.
|  Behold, O Lord, what I suffer
|    From the insolent foe.
|  [1:10] The foeman hath stretched out his hand
|    To secure all her treasures.
|  The hearthen she saw enter in
|    And her temple profane–
|  Even those Thou forbadest to mix
|    With Thine own congregation.
|  [1:11] Her people all groan and moan
|    In their search after bread.
|  They have given away their treasures
|    For food to revive them.
|  Behold, O Jehovah, and see
|    How abject am I.
|  [1:12] All ye that pass by, I appeal to you,
|    Look ye and see;
|  Has there ever been sorrow like mine,
|    Like that dealt out to me,
|  When the Lord, in His fierce indignation,
|    Did put me to grief?
|  [1:13] He hurled down fire from on high;
|    It hath entered my bones.
|  A net He hath spread for my feet;
|    He hath turned me backward.
|  Faint He hath left me and desolate
|    All the day long.
|  [1:14] A watch He hath kept on my sins;
|    And into a yoke
|  For my neck with His hands He hath twined them.
|    Then, crippling my strength,
|  He hath given me into the hands
|    Of a foe irresistible.
|  [1:15] The Lord hath hurled to the ground
|    All the strong men within me.
|  He hath summoned a festal assembly
|    To crush my young (warriors).
|  The Lord in His wine-press hath trodden
|    The daughter of Judah.
|  [1:16] For these things I weep without creasing;
|    Mine eyes stream with tears;
|  For none have I now by my side
|    To refresh me and comfort me.
|  My children are clean distraught,
|    For the foe hath prevailed.
|  [1:17] Zion hath stretched forth her hands;
|    There is no one to comfort her.
|  On her neighbours the Lord laid a charge
|    To be hostile to Jacob;
|  And now is Jerusalem vile
|    And abhorrent among them.
|  [1:18] As for the Lord, He is just;
|    For the rebel was I.
|  Ye peoples all, hear, I entreat you,
|    And look on my sorrow.
|  Together my maidens and youths
|    Are gone into captivity.
|  [1:19] I called upon those that had loved me,
|    But they have deceived me.
|  In the city my priest and mine elders
|    Have perished of hunger.
|  For the bread they searched in their need,
|    But their search was in vain.
|  [1:20] Look, Lord, for distress is upon me,
|    And ferment within me.
|  Within me my heart writhes with pain,
|    That, for playing the rebel,
|  The sword dealeth death in the streets,
|    In the houses the pestilence.
|  [1:21] Listen to these my sighs;
|    There is no one to comfort me.
|  My foes have all heard with delight
|    Of the evil Thou wroughtest me,
|  Bringing the day Thou proclaimedst
|    For all of my sins.
|  [1:22] Let their wickedness all come before Thee;
|    Let them fare like me;
|  And do even so unto them
|    As Thou didst unto me.
|  For my sighs are many and many,
|    And sore is my heart.

#### Lament over the Sorrows of Jerusalem ####

##### The Divine Judgment and the Inconsolable Sorrow #####

 [Lamentations 2] 

|  [2:1] Alas! How the Lord is beclouding
|    The daughter of Zion!
|  From the heaven down to earth He hath hurled
|    The glory of Israel.
|  In the day of His wrath He remembers
|    His foot-stool no more.
|  [2:2] Without pity the Lord hath engulfed
|    All the homesteads of Jacob.
|  In His wrath He hath torn clean down
|    All the strongholds of Judah,
|  Hath hurled to the ground in dishonour
|    Her king and her princes.
|  [2:3] He hath hewn in the glow of His anger
|    All Israel’s horn.
|  He hath drawn His right hand back
|    From the face of the foe.
|  Like a fire He is blazing in Jacob,
|    Devouring around.
|  [2:4] His bow He hath bent like a foeman;
|    He stands as for siege.
|  All the lovely He slays in the tent
|    Of the daughter of Zion.
|  He hath poured forth His anger like fire.
|  [2:5] The Lord hath become like a foe;
|    He hath swallowed up Israel,
|  Swallowed her palaces all–
|    He hath ruined her strongholds,
|  And heaped on the daughter of Zion
|    Lamenting and woe.
|  [2:6] His booth like His vine He hath ravaged;
|    He hath ruined His trysting-place.
|  Jehovah hath blotted from Zion
|    The feast and the sabbath.
|  The king and the priest He hath spurned
|    In the heat of His anger.
|  [2:7] The Lord hath rejected His altar
|    And cast off His holy place,
|  Given to the hands of the foemen
|    The walls of her palaces.
|  In the house of the Lord there were shouts
|    Like the shouts of a feast-day.
|  [2:8] For the walls of the daughter of Zion
|    The Lord hath planned ruin.
|  He stretched out the line, and withdrew not
|    His ravaging hand.
|  Wall and rampart He plunged into mourning–
|    Together they languish.
|  [2:9] Sunk in the dust are her gates,
|    And her bars He hath shivered.
|  Her king and her princes are exiles
|    And guidance is none.
|  Yea, and no vision hath come
|    From the Lord to His prophets.
|  [2:10] Speechless they sit on the ground,
|    Even the elders of Zion–
|  With dust cast up on their heads,
|    And with girdles of sack-cloth.
|  The maids of Jerusalem bow
|    With their heads to the ground.
|  [2:11] Mine eyes are wasted with weeping,
|    My bowels are troubled.
|  My heart is poured out on the ground
|    For the wreck of my people.
|  The babe and the suckling lie faint
|    On the streets of the city.
|  [2:12] To their mothers they keep on saying,
|    "O where is our bread?"
|  Like the wounded they lie in a swoon
|    On the streets of the city,
|  As they pour out their lives (to the death)
|    On the breasts of their mothers.
|  [2:13] With what shall I rank or compare thee,
|    O daughter of Jerusalem?
|  Where is thy like, that I comfort thee,
|    Virgin of Zion?
|  For vast as the sea is thy ruin;
|    (Alas!) who can heal thee?
|  [2:14] The visions thy prophets have brought thee
|    Are false and dishonest.
|  They did not uncover thy guilt,
|    And so save thee from exile.
|  The visions they uttered for thee
|    Were deceptive and false.
|  [2:15] They clapped their hand over thee–
|    All they that passed by.
|  They hissed and they wagged their heads
|    At Jerusalem’s daughter.
|  " Is this the city men called
|    The Perfection of Beauty?"
|  [2:16] Against thee thine enemies all
|    Opened wide their mouths,
|  They hissed and they wagged their heads
|    At Jerusalem’s daughter.
|  "Is this the city men called
|    The Perfection of Beauty?"
|  [2:16] Against thee thine enemies all
|    Opened wide their mouths.
|  They hissed and they gnashed their teeth:
|    "We have swallowed her up.
|  Yes, this is the day that we looked for:
|    We have it, we see it."
|  [2:17] Jehovah hath done what He planned,
|    Hath accomplished His word:
|  As in days long ago He enjoined,
|    He hath wrecked without pity,
|  Hath made thee the sport of thy foes
|    And exalted thine enemies.
|  [2:18] Cry thou aloud to the Lord,
|    O virgin of Zion.
|  Pour down thy tears like a torrent
|    By day and by night,
|  Give thyself no respite,
|    No rest to thine eyes.
|  [2:19] Arise, pierce the night with thy cries,
|    As each night-watch beginneth.
|  Pour out like water thy heart
|    In the face of the Lord.
|  Lift up thy hands unto Him
|    For the life of thy littles ones,
|  [2:20] Behold, O Lord, and consider
|    Whom thus Thou maltreatest.
|  Shall women devour their own offspring,
|    The babes that they dandled?
|  Shall the priest and the prophet be slain
|    In the Lord’s holy place?
|  [2:21] In the streets on the ground they are lying–
|    The young and the old.
|  My maidens and young men together
|    Are fallen by the sword.
|  In the day of Thy wrath Thou hast slaughtered
|    And slain without pity.
|  [2:22] Thou didst summon, as though ’twere a feast-day,
|    The villages round.
|  But not one in the day of Thine anger
|    Escaped or was left;
|  The children I brought up and fondled
|    Were slain by the foe.

#### Lament and Prayer ####

 [Lamentations 3] 

|  [3:1] I am the man who was humbled
|    By the rod of His anger.
|  [3:2] The way that He guided and led me
|    Was dark and unlighted.
|  [3:3] Against me alone was His hand
|    Ever turned all the day.
|  [3:4] He hath shrivelled my flesh and my skin;
|    He hath broken my bones.
|  [3:5] He hath built round bout me a wall
|    Of exhaustion and bitterness.
|  [3:6] He hath made me to dwell in the darkness
|    As those long dead.
|  [3:7] He hath shut me behind solid walls;
|    He hath loaded my chain.
|  [3:8] When I cry and entreat Him for help,
|    He is deaf to my prayer.
|  [3:9] He hath blocked up my path with hewn stone,
|    And my way He hath tangled.
|  [3:10] He lurketh for me like a bear
|    Or a lion in ambush.
|  [3:11] He chased me aside and He tore me
|    And left me forlorn.
|  [3:12] His bow he bent, and He set me
|    As mark for His arrow.
|  [3:13] Into my reins He hath driven
|    The shafts of His quiver.
|  [3:14] A derision was I to all peoples,
|    Their song all the day.
|  [3:15] To the full did He fill me with bitterness,
|    With wormwood He sated me.
|  [3:16] He hath broken my teeth with gravel,
|    And heaped me with ashes.
|  [3:17] He hath robbed me of peace; and of weal
|    I remember no more.
|  [3:18] So I said, "My glory is gone
|    And my hope in Jehovah."
|  [3:19] The thought of my woe and my wandering
|    Is wormwood and gall.
|  [3:20] My soul doth for ever recall them,
|    And is bowed down within me.
|  [3:21] Now this I will lay on my heart
|    And will therefore take hope–
|  [3:22] That the love of the Lord is unceasing,
|    His pity unfailing.
|  [3:23] Thy kindness is new every morning
|    And great is Thy faithfulness.
|  [3:24] "The Lord is my portion," I said:
|    "I will hope then in Him."
|  [3:25] Those that wait for the Lord find Him gracious–
|    The souls that do seek Him.
|  [3:26] It is good, then, in silence to wait
|    For the help of the Lord.
|  [3:27] It is good for a man that he carry
|    A yoke in his youth.
|  [3:28] Let him sit all alone and keep silence,
|    When He hath imposed it.
|  [3:29] Let him lay his lips low in the dust,
|    For perchance there is hope.
|  [3:30] Let him offer his cheek to the smiter
|    And bear all the taunt.
|  [3:31] For Jehovah will not cast away
|    The afflicted for ever.
|  [3:32] Though He wound, He will yet have compassion–
|    His love is so great.
|  [3:33] He is loth to give sorrow or pain
|    To the children of men.
|  [3:34] When the men of a land, taken prisoner,
|    Are crushed under foot:
|  [3:35] When a man is deprived of his right
|    In the face of the Highest:
|  [3:36] When the cause of a man is subverted:
|    Doth not the Lord see?
|  [3:37] Where is he that can bring things to pass,
|    That the Lord hath not ordered?
|  [3:38] Do not evil and good come alike
|    From the mouth of the Highest?
|  [3:39] Why then should a mortal complain
|    When chastised for his sins?
|  [3:40] Let us search and examine our ways
|    And return to the Lord.
|  [3:41] Let us lift up our hearts with our hands
|    Unto God in the heavens.
|  [3:42] "We have transgressed and rebelled,
|    And Thou hast not pardoned.
|  [3:43] Thou hast wrapped Thee in wrath and pursued us,
|    And slain without pity;
|  [3:44] Has wrapped Thee around in a cloud
|    Which no prayer could pass through.
|  [3:45] Thou hast made us off-scouring and refuse
|    In the midst of the nations.
|  [3:46] Against us our enemies all
|    Open wide their mouths.
|  [3:47] Fear and the pit are upon us,
|    Destruction and ruin."
|  [3:48] Mine eye runs with rivers of water
|    For the wreck of my people.
|  [3:49] Mine eye poureth down without rest
|    And without any respite,
|  [3:50] Until that Jehovah in heaven
|    Look down and behold.
|  [3:51] Mine eyes are vexed with grief
|    For the daughters of my city.
|  [3:52] They have hunted me sore like a bird–
|    Those that groundlessly hate me–
|  [3:53] Have ended my life in the dungeon
|    And cast stones upon me.
|  [3:54] Waters flowed over my head,
|    And I said, "I am lost."
|  [3:55] From the depths of the dungeon, O Lord,
|    Did I call on Thy name;
|  [3:56] And my voice Thou didst hear: "O hide not
|    Thine ear from my cry."
|  [3:57] Thou camest the day that I called Thee,
|    And badest me fear not.
|  [3:58] Thou pleddest my cause, O Lord,
|    And didst ransom my life.
|  [3:59] Thou hast seen, Lord, how I am wronged;
|    O secure for me justice:
|  [3:60] For all the revenge Thou hast seen
|    That they plotted against me.
|  [3:61] O Lord, Thou has heard all the insults
|    They plotted against me.
|  [3:62] The threatenings and plots without ceasing
|    Of those that assail me.
|  [3:63] See how, whether sitting or rising,
|    They mock me in taunt-songs.
|  [3:64] Thou wilt requite them, O Lord,
|    For the deeds they have done.
|  [3:65] Blindness of heart wilt Thou give them–
|    Thy curse be upon them!
|  [3:66] Pursue them in wrath and destroy them
|    From under Thy heavens.

#### Lament over the Sorrows of Jerusalem ####

##### The Fate of the People and their Leaders #####

 [Lamentations 4] 

|  [4:1] Alas! How bedimmed is the gold,
|    The most pure gold.
|  The jewels, so sacred, lie scattered
|    At every street corner.
|  [4:2] The children of Zion, the precious,
|    Whose worth is as gold,
|  Count, alas! but as earthenware pitchers,
|    The work of the potter.
|  [4:3] Even the monsters give breast
|    And they suckle their young;
|  But the daughters of my people are cruel
|    As ostriches wild.
|  [4:4] The tongue of the sucking child cleaves
|    To his palate for thirst.
|  The children are craving for bread;
|    There is none to dispose it.
|  [4:5] Those that had feasted on dainties
|    Now waste on the streets.
|  Those that were nurtured in scarlet
|    Lie huddled on ash-heaps.
|  [4:6] The guilt of my people surpassed
|    The transgressions of Sodom,
|  Whose overthrow came in a flash
|    Ere a hand could be wrung.
|  [4:7] Her princes were purer than snow,
|    They were whiter than milk,
|  With a skin more ruddy than coral
|    And veins like the sapphire.
|  [4:8] Now blacker than darkness their form–
|    On the streets no one knows them:
|  Their skin is drawn tight on their bones;
|    It is dry as a stick.
|  [4:9] Better they that are slain with the sword
|    Than that perish with hunger,
|  Pinning away for the lack
|    Of the fruits of the field.
|  [4:10] The hands of compassionate women
|    Have sodden their children.
|  Yea, these have served them for food
|    In the wreck of my people.
|  [4:11] The Lord hath accomplised His wrath,
|    Hath poured out His hot anger,
|  And kindled in Zion a fire
|    Which devoured her foundations.
|  [4:12] No kings of the earth had believed,
|    And no folk in the world,
|  That assailant or foeman could enter
|    The gates of Jerusalem.
|  [4:13] It was all for the sins of her prophets,
|    The crimes of her priests,
|  Who have shed in the midst of the city
|    The blood of the righteous.
|  [4:14] With the blood-stains upon them they reel
|    Like the blind through the streets,
|  And they touch with their robes those whom erstwhile
|    They could not endure.
|  [4:15] "Away, ye unclean!" – men adjure them–
|    "Away, touch us not!"
|  So they stagger and wander around
|    With no resting for ever.
|  [4:16] Jehovah Himself hath dispersed them–
|    He careth no more.
|  For the priest Ha hath shown no regard,
|    For the prophets no pity.
|  [4:17] How long did our weary eyes watch
|    For the help that was vain!
|  Yea, on our watch-tower we watched
|    For the nation that saved not.
|  [4:18] They hunted our steps, that we dared not
|    Appear in out streets.
|  Our days were cut short and completed;
|    Our end was now come.
|  [4:19] Swifter were they that pursued us
|    Than eagles of heaven.
|  Over the mountains they chased us;
|  They ambushed the desert.
|  [4:20] The breath of our life, God’s anointed,
|    Was trapped in their toils–
|  He of whom we had said, "’Neath his shade
|    We shall live as a nation."
|  [4:21] Be glad and rejoice in thy home-land,
|    O daughter of Edom.
|  To thee, too, the cup shall come round;
|    Thou’lt be drunken and naked.
|  [4:22] O Zion, thy guilt is now blotted:
|    Of exile no more!
|  But thy guilt He shall visit, O Edom;
|  Thy sins are laid bare.

##### Her Sorrows #####

 [Lamentations 5] 

|  [5:1] Bethink thee, O Lord, of our plight;
|    Look and see how Thy folk are insulted.
|  [5:2] Our home-land is turned unto strangers;
|    Our houses are passed unto aliens.
|  [5:3] Fatherless orphans are we,
|    And our mothers are like unto widows.
|  [5:4] The water we drink we must buy,
|    And our wood becomes our at a price.
|  [5:5] The yoke presses hard on our necks;
|    We are weary and never find rest.
|  [5:6] We have stretched out our hands unto Egypt;
|    To Assyria also, for bread.
|  [5:7] Our fathers, who sinned are no more;
|    And their guilt has been borne by us.
|  [5:8] Servants are now our lords;
|    From their hand there is no one to save us.
|  [5:9] We win bread at the risk of our lives
|    From the murderous bands of the desert.
|  [5:10] Like an oven our skin is aglow
|    With the fierce fever-heat of famine.
|  [5:11] The matrons they ravished in Zion,
|    The maids in the cities of Judah:
|  [5:12] Princes were hanged by their hands,
|    And the faces of elders dishonoured.
|  [5:13] Young men had to carry the mill;
|    Youths fell beneath loads of wood.
|  [5:14] The elders have from the gate
|    And the youths given over their music.
|  [5:15] The joy of our heart is vanished;
|    Our dancing is turned into mourning.
|  [5:16] The crown is fallen from our head;
|    Woe, woe unto us! We have sinned.
|  [5:17] For this is our heart turned faint,
|    For these things our eyes are grown dim–
|  [5:18] For the mountains of Zion, now waste,
|    Over which the jackals roam.

##### Prayer for Deliverance #####

|  [5:19] But thou, Lord, art seated for ever,
|    From age to age, on Thy throne.
|  [5:20] O why then forget us for ever,
|    And leave us for long, long days?
|  [5:21] Bring us back to Thee, Lord, let us turn,
|    And renew our days as of old;
|  [5:22] Unless Thou hast utterly spurned us
|    And Thine anger is all too sore.


The Book of Daniel
==================

 [Daniel 1] 

##### Nebuchadnezzar’s court #####

[1:1] In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem.

[1:2] The LORD  handed King Jehoiakim over to him, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them off to the land of Shinar to the temple of his god, and placed them in the temple treasury.

[1:3] The king commanded Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring to him some of the Israelite princes and nobles.[1:4] They were to be young men who were without physical defect and handsome, comfortable with all types of knowledge, well taught and quick to learn and able to serve in the king’s palace. They were to be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.[1:5] The king gave to them each day some of his rich food and some of the wine which he drank.[1:6] He also commanded that they should be taught for three years, and that at the end of that time they should enter the royal service.

[1:6] Among these young men were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah;[1:7] but the chief of the king’s eunuchs gave other names to them. To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abednego.

[1:8] But Daniel made up his mind not to become ritually unclean by being contaminated by the rich food of the king nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked the chief of the king’s eunuchs to help him avoid it.[1:9] God helped Daniel to win the kindness and favor of the chief.

[1:10] But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear that my lord, the king, who has given you your food and your drink, will see that your faces are sadder than those of young men who are your own age, and so you will endanger my head with the king.”

[1:11] So Daniel went to the guardian whom the chief of the eunuchs had put over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and said[1:12] “Test us for ten days; and let us have vegetables to eat and water to drink.[1:13] Then compare the way we look with that of the young men who eat of the king’s rich food. Then do to us as seems best.”[1:14] So he did as they asked and tested them for ten days.[1:15] At the end of ten days they looked better and they were healthier than all the young men who ate the king’s rich food.[1:16] So the guardian took away their rich food and the wine and gave them vegetables.

[1:17] To these four young men God gave knowledge, learning, and wisdom; and Daniel understood all kinds of visions and dreams.

[1:18] On the date which the king had fixed for introducing all the young men to the court, the chief of his eunuchs brought them to Nebuchadnezzar,[1:19] and the king talked with them. But not one of all the young men was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve the king.[1:20] On every subject which called for wisdom and understanding and about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the wise men and magicians who were in his entire kingdom.

[1:21] Daniel remained at the court until the start of the reign of King Cyrus.

 [Daniel 2] 

##### A king’s strange dream #####

[2:1] Nebuchadnezzar in the second year of his reign had dreams, and his mind was so troubled that he could not sleep.[2:2] Then the king sent for the magicians and the wise men, and the Chaldaens (who studied the stars) to tell him what his dreams meant. So they came in before the king,[2:3] and he said to them, “I have had a dream and my mind is troubled, for I want to know what the dream means.”

[2:4] Then those who studied the stars said to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will tell you what it means.”[2:5] The king answered, “What I now say is certain: if you do not tell me the dream and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be maderuins.[2:6] But if you tell the dream and what it means, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honors; therefore tell me the dream and what it means.”[2:7] They answered the second time, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will tell what it means.”[2:8] The king replied, “I see clearly that you wish to gain time, for you know that what I have said is certain,[2:9] and that if you do not tell the dream to me, you will all suffer the same punishment. So you have planned to speak lying and false words before me, until the time when it is to happen has passed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me what it means.”[2:10] The Chaldeans answered the king, “There is no man on earth who can do what the king asks, for no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any wise man or magician, or of one who studies the stars.[2:11] What the king asks is too hard. There is no one else who can tell it to the king, except the gods, who do not live among mortals.”[2:12] This made the king very angry and he ordered all the wise men of Babylon put to death.

[2:13] So the command was given that the wise men were to be put to death. Search was made for Daniel and his friends that they too might be put to death.[2:14] Then Daniel approached Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to put the wise men of Babylon to death, and quietly and carefully asked,[2:15] “Why is the king’s command so harsh?” When Arioch told Daniel the facts,[2:16] he went to the king and asked that he give him time to tell what the dream meant.

[2:17] Then Daniel went to his house and told the facts to his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, so that they might beg the God of heaven to be kind to them and to tell Daniel this secret, so that they might not die with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.[2:19] Then the secret was told to Daniel in a vision at night, and he praised the God of heaven and said:

|  [2:20] “Blessed be the name of God
|    from everlasting to everlasting!
|    For wisdom and power are his.

|  [2:21] He controls the seasons and times,
|    he removes and installs kings,
|  He gives wisdom to the wise,
|    and knowledge to those who have insight.
|  [2:22] He shows the deep, secret things;
|    he knows what is in the darkness,
|    and the light of truth dwells in him.

|  [2:23] God of my fathers:
|    I give you thanks and praise,
|  For you gave me wisdom and strength,
|    and havemade known the things we asked;

|  You have made known to us the king’s secret!”

[2:24] Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had commanded to kill the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not kill the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”

[2:25] Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel to the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the captives from Judah who will tell you what this dream means.”[2:26] The king said to Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar), “Can you make known to me the dream which I have had and what it means?”[2:27] Daniel answered, “The secret which the king asks is something that neither wise men, magicians, nor those who study the stars can make known to him;[2:28] but there is a God in heaven who tells secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will come in the future. Your dream and the visions which you had as you lay asleep are these:

[2:29] “The thoughts which came into your mind on your bed concerned what will happen in the future. The one who reveals secrets has made known to you what will come to pass.[2:30] This secret was not revealed to me because I am wiser than other living people, but so that the king might learn the interpretation: so that you might understand the thoughts that have come to you.

[2:31] “You, O king, had a vision and saw a great image. That image was large and it was exceedingly bright as it stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying.[2:32] The head of the image was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its body and its thighs of bronze,[2:33] its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.[2:34] You looked at it until a stone was cut out, not by human hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.[2:35] Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff which blows from the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away so that nothing was left of them. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the earth.

[2:36] “This is the dream, and we will tell the king what it means:[2:37] O king, you are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the rule, the power, the strength, and the glory.[2:38] Over the whole world he has given into your power, people, the wild beasts and the birds, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold.

[2:39] “After you will rise another kingdom not so strong as you are, and a third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over the whole earth.[2:40] A fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, for iron breaks in pieces and shatters all things, and like iron which crushes, it will break in pieces and crush all things.[2:41] As you saw the feet and toes, part clay and part iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it some of the strength of the iron, for you saw the iron mixed with clay.[2:42] As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly broken.[2:43] You saw the iron mixed with clay, for the ruling families will arrange marriage alliances between each other, but they will not stick together, just as iron does not stick to clay.

[2:44] “During the reigns of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will the power be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and destroy all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.[2:45] This is shown by the fact that you saw a stone cut out of the mountain, but not with human hands<>. It broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold.

“The great God has made known to the king what is to come, and the dream is real and this meaning true.”

[2:46] Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and ordered that a sacrifice and sweet odors should be offered to him.[2:47] The king also said to Daniel, “Your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and one who tells his secrets to his servant, for you have been able to tell this great secret.”[2:48] Then the king gave Daniel a high position and many costly gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief over all the wise men in Babylon.[2:49] But at Daniel’s request the king placed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the province of Babylon; while Daniel stayed in the king’s court.

 [Daniel 3] 

##### The test by fire #####

[3:1] Nebuchadnezzar, the king, made a statue of gold ninety feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.[3:2] Then he sent for the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up.[3:3] So the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces all came together for the dedication and stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

[3:4] Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations:[3:4] The moment you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you must fall down and worship the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.[3:6] Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace.”[3:7] So when all the people heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and the speakers of all languages fell down and worshipped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

[3:8] But at that time certain Chaldeans came near to the king and made this accusation against the Jews:[3:9] “O king, live forever! O king, you have commanded that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble must fall down and worship the golden statue,[3:11] and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace.[3:12] There are certain Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, whom you have placed in charge of the province of Babylon. These men, O king, have not obeyed your command; they do not serve your gods nor worship the golden statue which you have set up.”

[3:13] Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury gave command to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.[3:14] When they were brought before the king, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my god nor worship the golden statue which I have set up?[3:15] If you are now ready, as soon as you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, to fall down and worship the statue which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you will at once be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace. Where is there a god who can deliver you out of my hands?”[3:16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O king, there is no need of our answering you about this.[3:17] Our God whom we serve is able to save us from the burning, fiery furnace; he will save us out of your hand, O king.[3:18] But if not, know, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.”

[3:19] Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry and the appearance of his face changed, as he looked at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than usual.[3:20] He also commanded certain strong men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and throw them into the burning, fiery furnace.[3:21] Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their robes, and their other garments, and were thrown into the burning, fiery furnace.[3:22] As the king’s command was urgent and the furnace very hot, the flames destroyed the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.[3:23] But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the midst of the burning, fiery furnace.

[3:24] Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was so astonished that he rose up hastily and said to his counsellors, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the fire?” They answered, “True, O king.”[3:25] He said, “Now I see four men, unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unhurt, and the fourth looks like a god.”

[3:26] Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the door of the burning, fiery furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.[3:27] The officers, governors, and counsellors who were there saw that the fire had no power over the bodies of these men, and that the hair of their heads was not singed and that their cloaks were not harmed, and that there was no smell of fire. And[3:28] Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel to save his servants who trusted in him and refused to obey the king’s command and have offered their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own.[3:29] Therefore I command that every people, nation, and speaker of every language that says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut in pieces and their house will be made a ruin, for there is no other god who is so able to save as is this one.”[3:30] Then the king gave high positions, in the province of Babylon, to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

 [Daniel 4] 

##### The king’s madness #####

[4:1] Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May your peace be great.[4:2] It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me.[4:3] How great are his signs! And how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rule lasts from generation to generation.

[4:4] I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and prosperous in my palace.[4:5] I saw a dream that made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.[4:7] Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told the dream to them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation.

[4:8] But at last there came before me Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream to him:[4:9] “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the secret visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.[4:10] These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.[4:11] The tree grew and was strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it could be seen to the end of the earth.[4:12] Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; the animals of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens nested in its branches, and every kind of living being was fed from it.[4:13] I saw in the visions of my head on my bed a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.[4:14] He cried aloud, ‘Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the animals get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.[4:15] But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, with a band of iron and bronze; bound with iron and bronze he will be fed with the grass of the field, and wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion will be with the animals.[4:16] His mind will be changed so that it will not be that of a man, and an animals’s mind will be given to him, and seven times will pass over him.[4:17] The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the affair by the word of the holy ones, that the living may know that the Most High rules over human kingdoms of gives them to whoever he will, and can set up as ruler the humblest of people.[4:18] This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, O Belteshazzar, must declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

[4:19] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dumfounded for a moment, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, I wish the dream applied to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries![4:20] The tree which you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth,[4:21] whose leaves were fair, and whose fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which the animals sheltered, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their nests,[4:22] is you, O king – you who are great and strong; and your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.[4:23] You saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, and saying. Hew down the tree and destroy it.[4:24] This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:[4:25] You will be driven from people, and your dwelling will be with the animals of the field, and you will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he will.[4:26] And as they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, so your kingdom will be secure to you as soon as you recognize that the heavens do rule.[4:27] Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteous works, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; then perhaps there may be a continuation of your prosperity.”

[4:28] All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar:[4:29] At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.[4:30] The king said, “Is not this great Babylon which I have built for a residence, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”[4:31] While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has passed away from you,[4:32] and you will be driven from people, and your home will be with the animals of the field; you will be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whom he will.”[4:33] The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from people, and ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.

[4:34] At the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom lasts generation to generation;[4:25] and all the inhabitants of the earth are considered as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and no oone can stay his hand, or say to him. What are you doing?[4:36] At that same time my reason returned to me, and for the sake of my royal honor, my majesty and my kingly appearance were restored to me. Then my counsellors and my nobles sought eagerly for me; and I was established in my kingdom, and still greater power was added to me.[4:37] Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.

 [Daniel 5] 

##### The handwriting on the wall #####

[5:1] Belshazzar, the king, made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine before them all.[5:2] Under the influence of wine, he gave command to bring the gold and silver utensils which his father, Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the temple at Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines might drink from them.[5:3] So they brought the golden vessels which were taken from the temple of God which was at Jerusalem. The king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines drank from them.[5:4] They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

[5:5] At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote opposite the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote.

[5:6] Then the king grew pale, and fear filled his mind, his legs trembled and his knees knocked together.[5:7] He called for the magicians and the Chaldeans (who study the stars) and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold about his neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.”[5:8] Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing nor tell the king what it meant.[5:9] So King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face grew pale, and his nobles were thrown into confusion.

[5:10] Now the queen, because of what the king and his nobles had said, came into the banquet-house and said, “O king, live forever; let not your thoughts trouble you nor let yourself grow pale.[5:11] There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the days of your father he was found to have light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, put him in charge of all the magicians, Chaldeans and those who study the stars.[5:12] for an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, the interpreting of dreams and explaining of riddles and the solving of difficulties were found in this same Daniel, whose name the king changed to Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will tell what it means.”

[5:13] So Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you that Daniel, one of the men who were carried away captive, whom the king, my father, brought from Judah?[5:14] I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have understanding and great wisdom.[5:15] The wise men and the magicians have been brought in before me to read this writing and to tell what it means; but they are not able.[5:16] I have heard that you can tell what dreams mean and answer hard questions. Now if you can read the writing and tell what it means, you will be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about your neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.”

[5:17] Then Daniel answered the king, “Keep your gifts and give your rewards to another. Without them I will read the writing to the king, and tell what it means.[5:18] O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar, your father, the kingdom and power, glory and majesty.[5:19] Because of the power that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and races trembled and feared him. He killed or kept alive as he wished; and he raised up or put down whom he pleased.[5:20] But when he became proud and haughty, he was made to come down from his kingly throne and his glory was taken from him,[5:21] and he was driven away from men, and his mind became like that of the beasts, and he lived with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over the realm of humanity and that he sets up over it whom he will.

[5:22] “But you, his son Belshazzar, have not been humble, though you knew all this,[5:23] but you have raised yourself against the Lord of heaven, and have had the utensils of his temple brought before you, and you, your nobles, your wives, and the others of your household have drunk wine from them. You have given praise to the gods of silver, of gold, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which cannot see nor hear nor know; and you have not praised the God in whose control are your very breath and all that you do.”

[5:24] “Then the hand was sent out before him and traced this writing:

|  [5:25] MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.

[5:26] “This is what it means: Mene: God has numbered the days your kingdom and brought it to an end.[5:27] Tekel: you are weighed in the scales and found wanting.[5:28] Upharsin: your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”

[5:29] Then at Belshazzar’s command Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold was put about his neck, and he was proclaimed the third ruler in the kingdom.[5:30] But on that very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed,[5:31] and Darius, the Mede, who was sixty-two years old, received the kingdom.

 [Daniel 6] 

##### Daniel in the lions’ den #####

[6:1] It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty officers who ruled the whole kingdom,[6:2] and over them three chief officials, of whom Daniel was one, so that these officers might report to them and that the king should lose nothing.[6:3] Daniel was better than the other chief officials and the officers, for he had a fine spirit; and the king intended to set him over the whole empire.

[6:4] Then the chief officials and the officers tried to find a way to accuse Daniel of not having done his duty, but they could not find anything against him, for he was faithful and was not guilty of any mistake or wrong-doing.

[6:5] Then these men said, “We will not find any way to accuse this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”[6:6] So these chief officials and officers all went to the king, and said to him, “King Darius, live forever.[6:7] All the chief officials of the kingdom, the counsellors and the officers, the judges and the governors, have consulted together to have the king make a law and give a strong command that whoever will ask a petition of any god or person for thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into a den of lions.[6:8] Now, O king, give the command and sign the law that, like the law of the Medes and Persians, it may not be changed.”[6:9] So King Darius signed the law and the command.

[6:10] When Daniel learnt that the law was signed, he went into his house. His windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem, and he knelt upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks to his God as he had done before.[6:11] Then these men rushed in and found Daniel praying and calling upon his God.[6:12] So they went before the king and spoke to him about the royal command: “Have you not signed a command, that everyone who asks a petition of any person or god within thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?” The king answered, “The rule is fixed according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.”[6:13] Then they went on to say to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, nor to the command that you have signed, but prays three times a day.”

[6:14] When the king heard these words, he was greatly displeased, and set his heart on saving Daniel, and he worked until the sun set to save him.[6:15] Then these men all went to the king and said to him, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no command nor law which the king gives may be changed.”

[6:16] So the king gave his command, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, “Your God, whom you always serve, will save you.”[6:17] Then a stone was brought and laid at the entrance to the den; and the king sealed it with his own seal-ring and with those of his nobles, that no change might be made so as to rescue Daniel.[6:18] Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fastingalone; he could not sleep.

[6:19] At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king rose and hurried to the den of lions.[6:20] When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he called anxiously, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to save you from the lions?”[6:21] Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever.[6:22] My God has sent his angel and has closed the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me, for I was innocent before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.”[6:23] Then the king was very glad and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and it was found that he was not injured, for he had trusted in his God.

[6:24] Then the king commanded that those men who had accused Daniel should be brought and thrown into the den of lions, with their wives and children. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions pounced on them and tore them to pieces.

[6:25] King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and races in all his kingdom, “May your peace be great![6:26] I make a law that throughout all my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and is the same forever, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed; and his rule will be without end.[6:27] He saves and rescues, and does wonderful things in heaven and earth; it is he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.”

[6:28] So Daniel was successful and happy during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

 [Daniel 7] 

##### Vision of the great beasts #####

[7:1] In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream:

[7:2] “I saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea.[7:3] Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.[7:4] The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. I looked until its wings were stripped off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a person; and a human heart was given to it.[7:5] And I saw a second beast, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth, between its teeth; and they said to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’[7:6] After this I saw another like a leopard, which had upon its sides four wings of a bird; and the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it.[7:6] After this I saw in the night-visions a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the rest with its feet; and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.[7:8] While I considered the horns, another little horn came up among them, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; in this horn were eyes, like human eyes, and a mouth speaking arrogrant things.

[7:9] “I waited until thrones were set up, and an aged one took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and his hair like spotless wool, his throne was fiery flames, its wheels burning fire.[7:10] A fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books were opened.

[7:11] “I looked at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words which the horn spoke – I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to be fuel for the fire.[7:12] Also the rule of the rest of the beasts was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a fixed time and season.

[7:13] “I saw in the night-visions that there came with the clouds of heaven one like a human being, and he came even to the Aged One, and was brought near before him.[7:14] There was given him dominion and glory, and sovereignty, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away, and his sovereignty one which will not be destroyed.”

[7:15] As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved by reason of this, and the visions of my head troubled me.[7:16] I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me the interpretation of the things:[7:17] “These four great beasts are four kings who will arise out of the earth.[7:18] But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, and possess the sovereignty for ever, for ever and ever.

[7:19] Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet:[7:20] and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three horns fell – it that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, and it appeared to be greater than the rest.[7:21] I looked, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,[7:22] until the Aged One came, and judgment was given to the holy one of the Most High, and the fixed time came that the holy ones possessed the sovereignty.

[7:23] Thus he said: “The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms; and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces.[7:24] As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings.[7:25] He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the holy ones of the Most High; and he will think to change the fixed times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.[7:26] But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his kingdom, to consume and to destroy finally.[7:27] The sovereignty, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will surely be given to the holy people of the Most High; his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and all dominions will serve and obey him.”[7:28] Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and I turned pale, but I kept the matter in my mind.

 [Daniel 8] 

##### Vision of the ram and goat #####

[8:1] In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision came to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me previously.

[8:2] I saw in a vision – and when I saw, I was in the Shushan, the royal palace, which is in the province of Elam – and I saw in a vision, and I was by the River Ulai.[8:3] Then I looked up and saw standing before the river a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.[8:4] I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could escape, but he did as he pleased and exulted himself.

[8:5] As I was observing, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.[8:6] He came to the ram that had two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.[8:7] I saw him come close to the ram, and he was angered against him, and stuck the ram, and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to stand before him, but he threw him down to the ground and trampled upon him, and none could rescue the ram from him.[8:8] The he-goat exulted himself exceedingly; and when he had become strong, the great horn was broken. In its place there came up four other horns toward the four winds of heaven.

[8:9] Out of one of them came another little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.[8:10] It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host, and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them.[8:11] It exulted itself even to the prince of the host, and took away from him the daily sacrifice, and threw down the place of his sanctuary,[8:12] and it set up the sacrilegious tithing over the daily sacrifice, and threw down truth to the ground, and did it and prospered.

[8:13] Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one who spoke, “For how long will the vision be that the daily sacrifice will be taken away and the appalling sacrilege set up and the sanctuary and the host trampled under foot?”[8:14] He answered, “For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then will the sanctuary be justified.”

[8:15] When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and suddenly there stood before me one who had the appearance of a man.[8:16] I heard a human voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, “Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.”[8:17] So he came near where I stood; and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face, but he said to me, “Understand, mortal, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.”[8:18] Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright in my place.[8:19] He said, “I will make you know what will be in the time of wrath, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.[8:20] The ram which you saw, with the two horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia.[8:21] The he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.[8:22] As for that which was broken so that four stood up in its place, four kingdoms will arise out of his nation, but not with his power.[8:23] In the later days of their rule, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king defiant and skilled in dissimulation will stand up.[8:24] His power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will utter monstrous things, and will achieve, and will destroy the mighty ones.[8:25] His cleverness will be directed against the holy people; he will succeed through deceit, and devise great things, and he will destroy many unawares; he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be destroyed, but not by human hands.[8:26] The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but hide the vision for it belongs to many days to come.”

[8:27] I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for days; then I rose up and did the king’s business and I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it.

 [Daniel 9] 

##### Vision of the seventy weeks #####

[9:1] In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,[9:2] in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived by the books the number of years concerning which the word of the LORD  came to Jeremiah the prophet, that they should be completed while Jerusalem stood in ruins – namely seventy years.[9:3] I turned my face to the Lord God, to apply myself to prayer and supplication, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.[9:4] I prayed to the LORD  my God, and made confession, and said, “Oh, Lord, the great and the terrible God, who keeps the covenant and shows mercy to those who serve him and keep his commands,[9:5] we have sinned and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances;[9:6] neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.[9:7] Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but shame belongs, as at this day, to the people of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel who are near, and those who are afar off, in the lands where you have driven them, because of their crimes which they have committed against you.

[9:8] “Lord, to us belongs shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.[9:9] To the Lord our God belongs compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him,[9:10] neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD  our God, to walk in his teachings which he set before us by his servants the prophets.[9:11] All Israel have transgressed your law and have turned so as not to obey your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us, and the oath which is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.[9:12] He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great misfortune; for under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done as has been done to Jerusalem.[9:13] As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favour of the LORD  our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and discern your faithfulness.[9:14] Therefore the LORD  has watched over the evil and brought it upon us, for the LORD  our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.

[9:15] “Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gained renown as at this day, we have sinned and we have done wickedly.[9:16] O Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath, I beg you, be turned away from your city, Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of reproach to all who are round about us.[9:17] Listen, our God to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and show favor to your sanctuary, which is desolate, for the sake of your servants, O Lord.[9:18] O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which bears your name; for we do not present our supplications before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great compassion.[9:19] O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and perform; defer not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.”

[9:20] While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing, my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD  my God for the holy mountain of my God,[9:21] while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen earlier in the vision, being made to fly swiftly, approached me about the time of the evening offering.[9:22] He came, and talked with me, and said, “ Daniel, I have now come forth to give you wisdom and insight.[9:23] At the beginning of your supplications the command went forth, and I have come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved; therefore heed the word, and understand the vision.

[9:23] “Seventy weeks have been decreed upon your people and upon your holy city, to make an end of the sacrilege, and to complete the sin, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.[9:25] Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the command to repeople and rebuild Jerusalem to the anointed one, the prince, will be seven weeks; sixty-two weeks will it be rebuilt, with broad places and streets. At the end of times[9:26] (even after the sixty-two weeks) an anointed one will be cut off without judicial trial; and the city and the sanctuary will be destroyed together, and his end will come with a flood and even to the end there will be war, a sentence of desolations.[9:27] The covenant will be annulled for many for one week; and in the midst of the week the sacrifice and the offering will cease, and in its place will be an appalling abomination and that until the ruin determined upon, is poured out upon the appalling thing.”

 [Daniel 10] 

##### Vision of the kings of north and south #####

[10:1] In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a a revelation came to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, and it means great distress. He gave heed to the words, and understood the vision:

[10:2] “In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.[10:3] I ate no pleasant bread, neither did any meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were past.[10:4] In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river,[10:5] I looked up, and there was a man clothed in linen, with a belt of pure gold of Ophir;[10:6] his body also was like the chrysolith, and his face like lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.[10:7] I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling seized them, and they fled to hide themselves.[10:8] So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, for my fresh appearance was changed to pallor.[10:9] Yet when I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground.

[10:10] “Suddenly, a hand touched me, which set me trembling upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.[10:11] He said to me, ‘Daniel, greatly beloved, give heed to the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for to you have I now been sent.’ When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.[10:12] Then he said to me, ‘Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to gain insight, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.[10:13] The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the prince of the kings of Persia.[10:14] Now I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.[10:15] When he had said these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground, and was dumb.[10:16] Then one who looked human touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him who stood before me, ‘My Lord, because of the vision my pangs have come upon me, and I retain no strength,[10:17] for how can this the servant of my Lord talk with my Lord? For as for me, henceforth there remains no strength in me, nor is there breath left in me.

[10:18] “Then another in appearance like a person touched me, and strengthened me.[10:19] He said, ‘Greatly beloved, fear not; peace be to you; be strong, be bold.’ When he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, ‘Let my Lord speak; for you have strengthened me.’[10:20] Then he said, ‘Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia, and when I go forth, then the prince of Greece will come;[10:21] and none who help me against these, except Michael, your prince, stand as my helper and defence.

 [Daniel 11] 

[11:1] “‘But now I will tell you what is written in the book of truth.[11:2] Three more kings will stand up for Persia; and the fourth will be far richer than them all; and when he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece.[11:3] Then a warrior king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion and do according to his will.[11:4] When he has become strong, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided to the four winds of heaven, but it will not belong to his posterity, nor will it be as great as his dominion, which he ruled, for his kingdom will be overthrown and will belong to others besides these.

[11:5] “‘The king of the south will be strong, but one of his princes will be stronger than he, and will rule; his dominion will be great.[11:6] At the end of some years they will make an alliance with one another, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but that support will not retain strength, neither will his supports stand; but she will be given up, and they who brought her, and her child, and he who supported her.

[11:7] “‘But in those times a shoot out of her roots will arise in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will act against them and prevail,[11:8] and also will carry away their gods, together with their molten images and their costly things of silver and gold, captive into Egypt; and he will refrain some years from the king of the north.[11:9] Then another will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return to his own land.

[11:10] His son will war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, and he will come onward, and overflow, and pass through, and will return and war, even to his fortress.[11:11] The king of the south will be enraged, and the will come forth and fight with him. even with the king of the north, and that one will raise a great multitude, but the multitude will be delivered into his hands.[11:12] The multitude will be carried away, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not show himself strong.

[11:13] “‘The king of the north will return, and will raise a multitude greater than the former; and he will come after a period of several years, with a great army and with much equipment.[11:14] In those times many will stand up against the king of the south, also the sons of the violent among your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they will be overthrown.

[11:15] “‘So the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city; and the forces of the south will not stand, nor his chosen men, and there will be no strength to stand.[11:16] But he who will come against him, will do as he desires, and none will withstand him; and he will stand in the glorious land, and in his hand will be destruction.[11:17] He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, but he will make an agreement with him; and he will perform them; and he will give him the daughter of women, to ruin it; but it will not avail nor will he attain it.[11:18] After this he will turn his face to the coast-lands, and he will take many; but a consul will put an end to the insults offered by him; and will repay his insults sevenfold.[11:19] Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall and will no longer be found.

[11:20] “‘Then one will stand up in his place who will cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be broken, but not in anger nor in battle.[11:21] In his place there will stand up a contemptible person upon whom they had not conferred the royal honor; but he will come unexpectedly, and will obtain the kingdom by intrigues.[11:22] Forces will be utterly overwhelmed before him and will be broken, and also a prince of the covenant.[11:23] After they make a league with him he will act deceitfully; for he will rise and become strong, with a small nation.[11:24] He will come unperceived, even into the fattest parts of a province; and he will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he will scatter among them prey and spoil and riches, and he will devise plans against the strongholds, even for a time.[11:25] He will arouse his might and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will make war with an exceedingly great army; but he will not stand, for they will devise plans against him.[11:26] Those who eat his dainties will ruin him, and his army will be swept away as a flood, and many will fall down slain.[11:27] As for these kings, their hearts will be bent on mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it will not prosper, for yet the end will be at the time appointed.

[11:28] “‘Then will he return to his land with great riches, and his heart will be against the holy covenant; and he will do his pleasure, and return to his own land.[11:29] At the time appointed he will return, and enter into the south; but it will not be in the latter time as in the former;[11:30] for ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be cowed, and will return, and vent his rage on the holy covenant, and will do his pleasure. He will return and fix his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant.[11:31] Forces sent by him will prevail, and they will profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and will take away the daily offering and set up the appalling abomination.[11:32] He will pervert by specious promises, those who bring guilt upon the covenant; but the people who know their God will be valiant and do exploits.

[11:33] “‘They who are wise among the people will give understanding to many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil many days.[11:34] Now when they are falling, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with false protestations.[11:35] Some of those who are wise will fall, in order to refine them and cleanse them and make them white, until the time of the end, for it is yet for the time appointed.

[11:36] “‘The king will do according to his will; and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until God’s wrath be exhausted; for that which is decreed will be done.[11:37] Neither will he regard the gods of his fathers; nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he will magnify himself above all.[11:38] But in his place will he honor a god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not will he honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly things.[11:39] He will procure for the strong fortresses the people of a foreign god. Whomsoever he regards with favor he will raise to great honor, and he will make them to rule over many, and he will divide the land for a price.

[11:40] “‘At the time of the end the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into the countries, and he will overflow them and pass through.[11:41] He will enter also into the glorious land, and many thousands will fall; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the remnant of the Ammonites.[11:42] He will stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.[11:43] He will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and Ethiopians will follow in his train.[11:44] But rumors out of the east and north will trouble him; and he will go forth with great fury to destroy and to utterly exterminate many.[11:45] He will plant his palace between the Mediterranean and the glorious holy mountain; so he will come to his end, and none will help him.

 [Daniel 12] 

[12:1] “‘At that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of my people; and there will be a time of affliction such as there never was since there was a nation, even to that time; and at that time your people will be delivered, every one who will be found written in the loyal book.[12:2] Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.[12:3] They who are wise will shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.[12:4] But thou, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, to the time of the end; many will run to and fro and knowledge will be increased.’

[12:5] “Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others were standing, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on the other side.[12:6] One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, ‘How long will it be to the end of these marvels?’[12:7] The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, and he lifted up his right and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever: ‘It will be for a time, times, and a half; and when the power of the shatterer of the holy people will come to an end all these things will be finished.’[12:8] I heard but I understood not. Then I said, ‘My lord, what will be the end of these things?’[12:9] He said, ‘Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.[12:10] Many will cleanse themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but they who are wise will understand.[12:11] From the time that the daily sacrifice will be taken away, and the appalling abomination set up will be twelve hundred and ninety days.[12:12] Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty-five days.[12:13] But go your way to the end. You will take your rest and stand up to receive your lot at the end of the days.’”

|    So he went and married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam.

And when she conceived and bore him a son, [1:4] Jehovah said:

|  Call his name <<Jezreel,>>
|  For yet a little while
|  And I will avenge the blood shed at Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,
|  And I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.[1:5] 
|  And it shall come to pass in that day,
|  That I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

[1:6] And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him:

|  Call her name <<Unpitied,>>
|    For I will no longer
|  Have pity on the house of Israel.
|  That I should still spare them.

[1:8] 

|  Then she weaned Unpitied; and when she conceived and bore a son, hesaid:[1:9] 
|  Call his name, <<Not-my-people:>>
|  For ye indeed are not my people,
|  And I indeed am not your God.

Then Hosea said: 

|  *I will put away Gomer,*
|  For she is not my wife, 
|  And I will not be her husband;
|  And on her children I will have no pity,
|  Since they are children of whoredom,
|  For their mother hath become a harlot,She who conceived them hath behaved shamefully.

 [Hosea 3 ] 

[3 :1] But Jehovah said to me:

|  Still go, love this woman,
|  Who loves a paramour and is an adulteress,
|  As Jehovah loveth the Israelites,
|  Although they turn to other gods,
|  And love raisin-cakes.

[3 :2] So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and eight bushels of barley and a measure of barley.

[3 :3] And I said to her:

|  Many days shalt thou abide for me,
|  Thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife, 
|  Yet, I, on my part will be thine.[3 :4] 
|  For through many days
|  The Israelites shall abide
|  Without king and without prince, 
|  Without sacrifice and without pillar,
|  Without ephod and without teraphim.[3 :5] 

Afterward the Israelites shall return, and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. and they shall come trembling to Jehovah and his goodness, at the end of days.

 [Hosea 2] 

[2:2] 

|  Strive with your mother, strive,
|  That she put her acts of whoredom from her sight,
|  And her adulteries from between her breasts,
|  Lest I strip her naked,
|  And set her as she was on the day of her birth,
|  And make her like the wilderness,
|  And let her become like a parched land,
|  And let her die of thirst.

[2:5] For she hath said,

|  I will go after my paramour
|  Who gave me my bread and my water,
|  My wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.[2:6] 
|  Therefore I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns, 
|  And build a wall about her, 
|  So that she cannot find her paths. [2:7] 
|  And she will pursue her paramours,
|  But will not overtake them, 
|  And she will seek and not find them.[2:8] 
|  But she herself did not know 
|  That it was I who gave her 
|  The corn, the sweet wine, and the oil.[2:9] 
|  Therefore I will take back my corn in its time,
|  And my sweet wine in its season,
|  And I will withdraw my wool and my flax,
|  Given to cover her nakedness;[2:10] 
|  And so I will uncover her shame,
|  And none shall deliver her out of my hand.[2:12] 
|  And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees,
|  Of which she bath said, <<These are my rewards
|  Which my lovers have given me.>>
|  And I will make them a thicket,
|  And the wild beasts shall devour them.[2:11] 
|  And I will also cause all her mirth to cease,
|  Her feasts, her new moon, and her sabbaths.[2:13] 
|  And thus will I visit upon her the days of the Baalim,
|  In which she made offerings to them,
|  And decked herself with ear-rings and jewels,
|  And went after her paramours,
|  And forgot me, is the oracle of Jehovah.[2:14] 
|  Therefore I am going to allure her,
|  And bring her into the wilderness,
|  And speak endearingly to her.[2:15] 
|  And I will give her from there her vineyards,
|  And the valley of Achori as a door of hope,
|  And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth,
|  As in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.[2:16] 
|  And it shall be in that day, is the oracle of Jehovah,
|  She shall call to her husband,
|  And shall call no more to the Baalim.[2:17] 
|  And I will remove the name of the Baitlim from her mouth,
|  And they shall no more be mentioned by their names.[2:18] 
|  And I will betroth her to me forever,[2:19] 
|  Yea, I will betroth hers to me in righteousness,
|  And in judgment, and in kindness, and in mercy,[2:20] 
|  Yea, I will betroth her to me in faithfulness and she shall knowJehovah!

[2:21] 
|  And it shall come to pass in that day,
|  That I will speak, — it is the oracle of Jehovah,—
|  I will speak to the heavens,
|  And they will speak to the earth.[2:22] 
|  And the earth will speak to the grain,
|  And the new wine and the oil:
|  And they shall speak to Jezreel,
|  And I will sow her in the land.[2:23] 
|  And I will have pity upon the unpitied,
|  And I will say to Not-my-people, <<Thou art my people,>>
|  And they will say, <<Thou art my God.>>

 [Hosea 2] 

[2:18] 
|  And I will make for them a covenant in that day,  
|  With the wild beasts, and the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the earth,
|  And the bow and the sword and war I will completely destroy from out the land, 
|  And I will make them lie down in safety.

 [Hosea 1] 

[1:10] 
|  And the number of the Israelites shall be as the sand of the sea,
|  Which cannot be measured or numbered;
|  And instead of its being said of them, <<Ye are not my people,>> 
|  They shall be called, <<The sons of the living God.>>[1:11] 
|  And the Judahites and the Israelites shall be gathered together,
|  And they shall appoint for themselves one head, and they shall go up out of the land,
|  For great shall he the day of Jezreel.

 [Hosea 2 ] 

[2 :1] 
|  Say ye to your brother, <<My people>> and to your sister, <<Pitied>>.

 [Hosea 4] 

[4:1] 
|  Hear the word of Jehovah, O Israelites,
|  For Jehovah hath a charge against the inhabitants of the land,
|  For there is no fidelity, nor true love,
|  Nor knowledge of God in the land,[4:2] 
|  But perjury, lying, and murder,
|  Stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence,
|  And acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other.[4:3] 
|  Therefore the land mourns,
|  And all its inhabitants languish,
|  Together with the wild beasts and the birds of the heavens,
|  While even the fish of the sea are swept away,[4:3] 
|  Yet let none bring charges,
|  And let none reprove,
|  Since my people are but as their priestlings,[4:5] 
|  O priest, thou shalt stumble by day,
|  And the prophet also shall stumble with thee,
|  By night I will destroy thy people.[4:6] 
|  Thy people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge.
|  Because thou hast rejected knowledge,
|  I reject thee from being priest to me.
|  Since thou hast forgotten the instruction of thy God,
|  I also will forget thy children.[4:7] 
|  The more they increased the more they sinned against me,
|  They have changed their glory for shame.[4:8] 
|  They feed on the sin of my people,
|  And they lust after their guilt.[4:9] 
|  Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest,
|  But I will visit upon each punishment for his ways,
|  And their deeds I will requite to them.[4:10] 
|  For they shall eat and not be satisfied,
|  They shall play the harlot and not find satisfaction,Because they have ceased to heed Jehovah.[4:11] 
|  Harlotry and sweet wine take away the understanding;[4:12] 
|  My people ask counsel of their wood,
|  And their staff makes known to them their oracle!
|  For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray,
|  So that they have played the harlot from after their God.[4:13] 
|  On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice,
|  And on the hills they burn their offerings,
|  Under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
|  For their shade is pleasant!
|  Therefore your daughters play the harlot,
|  And your brides commit adultery.[4:14] 
|  I will not punish your daughters because they play the harlot,  
|  Nor your brides because they commit adultery,
|  And sacrificed with consecrated prostitutes;
|  Thus the stupid people come to ruin![4:15] 
|  Though thou play the harlot, Israel,
|  Let not Judah become guilty,
|  And do not come to Gilgal
|  And do not go up to Beth-avem.
|  And do not swear at Beersheha, As Jehovah liveth.[4:16] 
|  Yea, like a stubborn heifer,
|  Israel has behaved stubbornly,
|  Can Jehovah now feed him,
|  As he would a lamb in a broad pasture?[4:17] 
|  Ephraim is wedded to idols; leave him alone![4:18] 
|  A band of topers! They gave themselves up to harlotry;
|  They love shame more than honor.[4:19] 
|  A wind-storm shall envelop them in its wings,
|  And they shall be ashamed of their altars.

 [Hosea 5] 

[5:1] 
|  Hear this, O priests,
|  And hearken, O house of Israel,
|  And, O house of the king, give heed;
|  Since for you is the judgment.
|   A snare have you become at Mizpeh,
|  And a net spread out on Tabor,[5:2] 
|  And a deep pit have they dug at Shittim,
|  And there is no correction for any of them?[5:3] 
|  I indeed know Ephraim,
|  And Israel is not hid from me,
|  For thou, O Ephraim, hast played the harlot,
|  Israel is defiled.[5:4] 
|  Their deeds do not permit them,
|  To return to their God,
|  For the spirit of harlotry is within them,
|  And Jehovah they do not know.[5:5] 
|  Therefore Israel’s pride shall testify to his face,
|  And Ephraim shall stumble through his guilt.
|  Judah also shall stumble with them.[5:6] 
|  With their sheep and their cattle, they shall go about
|  To seek Jehovah, but shall not find him,[5:7] 
|  For they have been untrue to Jehovah,
|  Since they have begotten alien children;
|  A new moon may destroy them with their portions.

[5:8] 
|  Blow the trumpet in Gibeah,
|  The clarion in Ramah,
|  Raise the alarm in Bethel,
|  Make Benjamin trernble,[5:9] 
|  Ephraim shall become a desolation
|  In the day of punishment,
|  Concerning the tribes of Israel I make known what is certain.[5:10] 
|  The princes of Israel have become,
|  Like those who remove the landmarks;
|  Upon them I will pour out my wrath like water.[5:11] 
|  Ephraim practises oppression and crushes right,
|  For he is determined to go after vanity.

[5:12] 
|  But I am like a moth to Ephraim, 
|  Like rottenness to the house of Israel; [5:13] 
|  For when Ephraim saw his sickness; 
|  And Israel his sore,
|  Ephraim went to Assyria
|  And Israel to the great king;
|  But he cannot heal you,
|  Nor relieve you of your wound.[5:14] 
|  For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim,
|  And like a young lion to the house of Israel.
|  I, even I, will rend and go my way,
|  I will carry off and none shall rescue.

[5:15] 
|  I will return to my place,
|  Until they are confounded and seek my presence.
|  When they are in distress they will quickly seek me,

 [Hosea 6] 

[6:1] 
|  Saying, <<Come let us return to Jehovah,
|  For he bath torn and he will heal us,
|  He hath smitten and he will bind us up,[6:2] 
|  He will revive in a couple of days,
|  On the third day he will raise us up again,
|  That we may live in his presence.[6:3] 
|  Yea, let us know, let us eagerly seek to know Jehovah,
|  As soon as we quickly seek him,
|  Then he will come to us as the winter rain,
|  As the spring rain that waters the earth.>>

[6:4] 
|  What can I make of you, O Ephraim!
|  What can I make of you, O Israel!
|  Since your love is like a morning cloud,
|  Yea, like the dew which early goes away.[6:5] 
|  Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,
|  I have slain themk by the words of my mouth. 
|  And my judgment is like the light that goes forth, [6:6] 
|  For it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice, 
|  And knowledge of God and not burnt-offerings.

[6:7] 
|  But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant,
|  There they have played me false.[6:8] 
|  Gileadm is a city of evil-doers,
|  Tracked with bloody footprints,[6:9] 
|  And as bandits lie in wait for a man,
|  So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem;
|  Verily they commit deliberate crime.[6:10] 
|  In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing,
|  There Ephraim plays the harlot;
|  Israel is defiled.[6:11] 
|  Judah for thee also a harvest is set.When I would turn, when I would heal Israel,Then Ephraini’s guilt is revealed,And Samaria’s crimes are seenHow they practise fraud and the thief enters in,While abroad bandits plunder.2But they never think in their hearts,That all their wickedness I remember.’Now their deeds have encompassed them,They are ever before my face.2In their wickedness they anoint kings,’"And in their falsehood princes,’Since they are all of them adulterers.v2By clay"’ they make our king sick,And the princes with fever from wine,He stretches forth his hand with dissolute fellows,’For like an oven their heart burns with treachery,`All night theirs’ anger slumbers,In the morning it blazes into a flame of fire.7A11 of them glow like an oven,And they devour their rulers,All their kings have fallen.There is none among them who calls to me.21.

The Horrors of the Coming Exile, Hos. 91.9Hos. 9 ’Rejoice not too loudly,b 0 Israel, like the heathen, For thou hast played the harlot, being untrue to thy God,c Thou hast loved a harlot’s hire upon every threshing-fioond 2Threshing-fioor and wine-vat shall not know them,e And the new wine shall disown them.’They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land,95But Ephraim shall return to Egypt,And in Assyria they shall eat what is unclean.4They shall not pour out libations of wine to Jehovah,Nor prepare for him their sacrifices,Theirf bread shall be like the bread of mourning;All who eat it shall defile themselves,For their bread shall be only for their hunger,It shall not come into Jehovah’s temple.5What will ye do on the day of the festival?4Or on the day of Jehovah’s feast ?°For behold they will soon go to Assyria ,hEgypt shall gather them, Memphis’ shall bury them, Nettles shall take possession of their treasure of silver, Thorns shall come tip in their tents)7The days of visitation are come,The days of recompense are at hand,The Israelitesk shall know,Who say, The prophet is a fool,The inspired man is raving mad,It is because of the greatness of thy iniquity and the greatness ofthy sin.m8Ephraim acts the spy with my God,A prophet finds the snares of a fowler are in all his ways;In the house of his God they lay hostile plots,"’They commit crimes as in the days of Gibeah,Jehovah will remember their iniquity,He will visit with punishment their sin.96§ 24. Israel’s Corrupt Religious Practices and the Inevitable Judgment,Hos. 910-109Hos. 9 "Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel;`)Like the first fruit on a fig-tree" I saw your fathers;But as soon as they came to Baal-peor,q they consecrated themselvesto Baal,rAnd became as abominable as the object of their love."Ephraim—like a bird his glory flies away ;There shall be no more birth, no more motherhood, no more conception.

|  [1:1] The LORD ’s message that came to Joel, son of Pethuel.

##### Locust plague and drought #####

|  [1:2] Hear this, elders,
|    pay attention, all inhabitants of the land,
|  Has anything like this happened in your days,
|    or in the days of your ancestors?
|  [1:3] Recount it to your children;
|    let your children tell it to their children,
|    and their children to the generation that follows.

|  [1:4] That which the cutting locust has left,
|    the swarming locust has eaten,
|  that which the swarming locust has left,
|    the hopping locust has eaten,
|  and that which the hopping locust has left,
|    the destroying locust has eaten.

|  [1:5] Awake, drunkards, and weep,
|    and wail, all drinkers of wine;
|    the new wine is cut off from your mouth.
|  [1:6] For a nation has come up on my land,
|    powerful, and numberless;
|  its teeth are the teeth of a lion,
|    and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness.
|  [1:7] It has laid waste my vines,
|    and barked my fig-tree;
|  it has peeled and cast it away,
|    bleached are the branches.

|  [1:8] Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth,
|    for the husband of her youth.
|  [1:9] Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings
|    from the house of the LORD ;
|  in mourning are the priests,
|    who minister at the LORD ’s altar.
|  [1:10] The fields are blasted,
|    the land is in mourning,
|  for ruined is the grain,
|    the new wine fails
|    and the oil is dried up.
|  [1:11] Be dismayed, farmers;
|    wail, vine-dressers.
|  For the wheat and the barley;
|    for the harvest is lost from the fields.
|  [1:12] The vine fails to bear fruit,
|    and the fig-tree is drooping;
|  the pomegranate, palm, and apple,
|    all the trees of the field are dried up.
|  The people’s joy withers.

|  [1:13] Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests;
|    wail, ministers of the altar;
|    come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God;
|  for cereal-offering and drink-offering
|    are cut off from the house of your God.

|  [1:14] Sanctify a fast,
|    summon an assembly,
|  gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
|    into the house of the LORD  your God,
|  cry to the LORD :
|    [1:15] Alas for the day!
|  Near at hand is the day of the LORD,
|    and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.

|  [1:16] Is not food cut off
|    from before us,
|  gladness and joy
|    from the house of our God?
|  [1:17] The grains shrivel under their hoes,
|    the storehouses are desolate,
|    the barns broken down,
|    for the grain is withered.
|  [1:18] How the herds of cattle bellow in distress,
|    for they have no pasture!
|  The flocks of sheep are forlorn.

|  [1:19] To you, the LORD, I cry.
|  For fire has devoured
|    the pastures of the wilderness,
|    and flame has scorched
|    all the trees of the field.
|  [1:20] The wild animals also look up to you longingly,
|    for the water-courses are dried up,
|    and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

 [Joel 2] 

|  [2:1] Blow a horn in Zion,
|    sound an alarm in my holy mountain,
|  let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
|    for the day of the LORD  comes,
|    for near is[2:2] the day of darkness and gloom,
|    the day of cloud and thick darkness!

|  Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains,
|    a people great and powerful;
|  its like has not been from of old,
|    neither will be any more after it,
|    even to the years of coming ages.

|  [2:3] Before them the fire devours,
|    and behind them a flame burns;
|  like the garden of Eden is the land before them,
|    and after them it is a desolate desert,
|  nothing escapes them.

|  [2:4] Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
|    and like horsemen they charge.
|  [2:5] Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap,
|    like the crackle of flames devouring stubble,
|  like a mighty people preparing for battle.

|  [2:6] Peoples are in anguish before them,
|    all faces grow pale.

|  [2:7] Like mighty men they run,
|    like warriors they mount up a wall,
|  they march each by himself,
|    they break not their ranks,
|  [2:8] none jostles the other.

|  They march each in his path.
|    They fall upon the weapons without breaking.
|  [2:9] They scour the city, they run on the wall.
|    They climb up into the houses.
|  Like a thief they enter the windows.

|  [2:10] Earth trembles before them,
|    the sky quakes,
|  the sun and moon become dark,
|    and the stars withdraw their shining;
|  [2:11] and the LORD  utters his voice before his army,
|    for his host is exceedingly great.
|  Mighty is he who performs his word.
|    For great is the day of the LORD,
|  it is terrible, who can endure it?

|  [2:12] But now this is the message of the LORD :
|  Turn to me with all your heart,
|    and with fasting and weeping and mourning,
|  [2:13] rend your hearts and not your garments,
|    and turn to the LORD  your God;
|  for he indeed is gracious and merciful,
|    slow to anger and plenteous in love,
|  and relents of the evil.
|  [2:14] Who knows but he will turn and relent,
|    and leave a blessing behind him,
|    a cereal and drink-offering for the LORD  your God.

|  [2:15] Blow a horn in Zion,
|    sanctify a fast, summon an assembly,
|  [2:16] gather the people, make holy the congregation,
|    assemble the elders,
|  gather the children,
|    and the infants at the breast.
|  Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber,
|    and the bride from her bridal tent.

|  [2:17] Between the porch and the altar,
|  let the priests, the ministers of the LORD  weep aloud,
|  let them say:
|    Spare, the LORD, your people.
|    Make not your heritage an object of reproach,
|    for the heathen to mock them.
|    Why should it be said among the nations, ‘Where is their God?’

##### Future blessings #####

[2:18] Then the LORD  became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity upon his people,[2:19] and the LORD  answered and said to his people:

|  I will send you grain, wine, and oil.
|    You will be satisfied.
|  I will not make you again
|    an object of scorn among the nations,
|  [2:20] I will remove far from you the northern foe,
|    and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate,
|  its front into the eastern sea,
|    and its rear to the western sea.
|  And from it a stench will arise.

|  He has done great things!
|  [2:21] Fear not, land, exult.
|    Rejoice for the LORD  has done great things!
|  [2:22] Fear not, animals of the field.
|    For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass,
|  for the trees bear their fruit,
|    fig-tree and vine yield full harvest.
|  [2:23] Be glad, then, children of Zion,
|    and rejoice in the LORD  your God,
|  For he has given you the early rain in just measure,
|    and poured down upon you the winter rain,
|  and sent the latter rain as before.
|  [2:24] The threshing floors will be full of grain,
|    and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

|  [2:25] I will repay you for the years
|    which the swarming locust has eaten.
|  The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts,
|    my great army which I sent among you,
|    and my people will never again be put to shame.
|  [2:26] You will eat your food and be satisfied,
|    and praise the name of the LORD  your God,
|  who has dealt so wonderfully by you,
|  [2:27] and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,
|    that I am the LORD  your God and none else,
|    and my people will never again be put to shame.

|  [2:28] Afterwards,
|    I will pour out my spirit on everyone.
|  Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
|    your old men will dream dreams.
|  Your young men will see visions,
|    [2:29] and even on your male and female slaves
|  in those days, I will pour out my spirit.

|  [2:30] And I will show signs in the sky and on earth:
|    Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
|  [2:31] The sun will be turned into darkness,
|    and the moon into blood
|  before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD .

[2:32] But whoever will call upon the name of the LORD  will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as the LORD  has said, and among the fugitives those whom the LORD  calls.

 [Joel 3] 

[3:1] For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,[3:2] I will also gather all the nations and bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land.

|  [3:3] They have cast lots for my people.
|  They have traded boys
|    for prostitutes,
|  and sold girls for wine,
|    and drunk it.

[3:4] What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads.[3:5] You who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly jewels into your palaces,[3:6] you have sold the people of Judah and of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their own borders.[3:7] I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head.[3:8] I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the LORD  has spoken.

|  [3:9] Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war.
|  Arouse the warriors,
|    let all the fighting men muster and go up.
|  [3:10] Beat your ploughshares into swords,
|    and your pruning-hooks into lances;
|  let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong.
|  [3:11] Bestir yourselves and come,
|    all you nations round about.
|  Quickly gather yourselves together,
|    ask the LORD  to bring his warriors.

|  [3:12] Let the nations rouse themselves
|    and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
|  for there will I sit to judge
|    all the surrounding nations.
|  [3:13] Put in the sickle,
|    for the harvest is ripe;
|  go in, tread,
|    for the wine press is full.
|  The vats overflow,
|    for great is their wickedness.
|  [3:14] Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes
|    in the valley of decision
|  For near is the LORD ’s day in the valley of decision!

|  [3:15] Sun and moon have turned dark,
|    and the stars withdrawn their shining.

|  [3:16] Whenever the LORD  roars from Zion
|    and utters his voice from Jerusalem,
|  earth and sky quake;
|  but the LORD  is a refuge to his people,
|    and a fortress to the people of Israel.
|  [3:17] And you will know that I am the LORD  your God,
|    I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain,
|  and Jerusalem will be holy,
|    and strangers will not pass through her any more.

|  [3:18] In that day,
|    the mountains will drop sweet wine,
|  the hills will flow with milk,
|    all the channels of Judah will flow with water,
|  a fountain will spring from the house of Judah,
|    and will water the Valley of Shittim.
|  [3:19] Egypt will become a desolation,
|    and Edom a wilderness,
|  because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
|    because they shed innocent blood in their land,
|  [3:20] Judah will remain inhabited forever,
|    and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
|  [3:21] I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged.

|  The LORD  lives in Zion!


The Sermons of
--------------

Amos
====

 [Amos 1] 

[1:1] 

##### The Superscription and Text of the Book #####

The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, and in the reign of Jeroboam the son of King Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

|  [1:2] Amos said:
|  Whenever the LORD  roars from Zion,
|  and utters his voice from Jerusalem,
|  the pastures of the shepherds dry up,
|  and the top of Carmel becomes arid.

##### The Judgment About to Overtake Israel’s Guilty Neighbors #####

|  [1:3] The LORD  says:
|  For Damascus’ three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.

|  [1:4] Therefore I will send fire on Hazael’s house,
|  and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad,
|  [1:5] and I will break open the gate of Damascus,
|  and I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven,
|  and the sceptered ruler of Beth-Eden;
|  the people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir,
|  says the LORD .

|  [1:6] The LORD  says:
|  For Gaza’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They carried away captive a whole nation,
|  sold them as slaves to Edom.

|  [1:7] Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza,
|  and it shall devour her palaces.
|  [1:8] And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod,
|  and the sceptered ruler of Askelon.
|  I will turn my hand against Ekron,
|  and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,
|  the LORD  says.

|  [1:9] The LORD  says:
|  For Tyre’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom,
|  and did not remember the brotherly covenant.

|  [1:10] So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre.
|  It will devour her palaces.

|  [1:11] The LORD  says:
|  For Edom’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They pursued their relatives with the sword,
|  stilled their pity,
|  cherished their anger continually,
|  retained their fury forever.

|  [1:12] So I will send a fire into Teman.
|  It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah.

|  [1:13] The LORD  says:
|  For Ammonites’ three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,
|  in their lust for land.

|  [1:14] So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah.
|  It will destroy her palaces,
|  with a war-cry in the day of battle,
|  with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
|  [1:15] Their king will go into exile,
|  he and his nobles together,
|  says the LORD .

|  

 [Amos 2] 

[2:1] The LORD  says:
|  For Moab’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom,      
|  [2:2] to desecrate the dead.

|  So I will send a fire into Moab.
|  It will devour the palaces of Kirioth,
|  with a war-cry,
|  with the sound of trumpets.
|  [2:3] I will kill the ruler,
|  all his nobles I will slay with him,
|  says the LORD .

|  [2:4] The LORD  says:
|  For Judah’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They have rejected the law of the LORD,
|  and have not kept his statutes,
|  but their false gods their ancestors followed,
|  have led them astray.

|  [2:5] So I will send a fire on Judah.
|  It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

##### The Judgment Awaiting Thrice Guilty Israel #####

|  [2:6] The LORD  says:
|  For Israel’s three crimes –
|  no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment.
|  They sell the righteous for money,
|  the needy for a pair of shoes.
|  [2:7] They trample on the head of the poor,
|  push the humble out of the way.
|  Father and son go to the same temple girl,
|  and so profane my holy name.
|  [2:8] They stretch themselves on garments taken in pledges beside every altar,
|  and they drink the wine of those who have been fined in the house of their God.      

|  [2:9] It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake,
|  whose height was like that of the cedars,
|  as strong as oaks.
|  I destroyed their fruit from above and their roots from below.

|  [2:10] It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,       
|  and led you forty years in the wilderness,
|  and brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites.    

|  [2:11] I raised up some of your sons to be prophets
|  and some of your youths to be Nazirites.
|  Is not this indeed so, Israelites?
|  says the LORD .       
|  [2:12] But you made the Nazirites drink wine
|  and banned the prophets from prophesying.

|  [2:13] Listen!
|  It is I who will make you groan in your places,      
|  as a wagon groans under its load of grain.   

|  [2:14] Then flight will fail the swift,  
|  and the strength of the strongest will be useless.
|  The warrior will not save his life,  
|  [2:15] the archer will not stand firm,
|  the swift of foot will not escape,
|  the horseman will not save his life.
|  [2:16] The bravest of warriors
|  will flee away naked in that day,
|  says the LORD .

 [Amos 3] 

[3:1] 

##### The Basis of the Prophet’s Arraignment of Israel #####

|  Hear this word
|  which the LORD  has spoken against you, Israelites,
|  against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt:
|  [3:2] You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world,
|  this is why I will punish you for your crimes.

|  [3:3] Do two walk together unless they agreed to meet?
|  [3:4] Does a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him?
|  Does a young lion cry out in his den unless he has caught something?
|  [3:5] Does a bird swoop down into a trap if no bait is set for it?
|  Does a trap spring up from the ground if nothing sets it off?
|  [3:6] Can a trumpet be blown in a city and the people not tremble?
|  Can disaster strike a city and the LORD  not have caused it?

|  [3:7] Surely the Lord the LORD  does nothing
|  without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets.
|  [3:8] The lion has roared; who does not fear?
|  The Lord GOD  has spoken; who will not prophesy?

##### The Guilt and Doom of Samaria #####

|  [3:9] Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod,
|  and over the palaces in the land of Egypt:
|  Gather upon the mountain of Samaria,
|  and see the violent turmoil,
|  the acts of oppression in her midst.
|  [3:10] For they do not know how to do right.
|  They are heaping up violence and oppression in their palaces,
|  says the LORD .

[3:11] 
|  Therefore the Lord GOD  says: 
|  An enemy will surround the land,     
|  he will strip your strength from you.
|  and your palaces will be looted.[3:12] 
|  The LORD  says:
|  Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion
|  two shin-bones or a piece of an ear,
|  so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued –
|  with the corner of a couch,
|  and the damask of a divan!

[3:13] 
|  Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,
|  says the Lord GOD , the God of hosts.[3:14] 
|  On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes,
|  I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel,
|  and the horns of the altar will be hacked off,
|  and they will fall to the ground.
|  [3:15] I will destroy the winter houses together with the summer houses
|  and the houses of ivory will perish.
|  Many great houses will be swept away,
|  says the LORD .

|  

 [Amos 4] 

[4:1] Listen to this message, women of Sameria,
|  you well-fed cows of Bashan,
|  who oppress the poor and crush the needy,
|  who say to your husbands, “Bring us another drink!”

|  [4:2] The Lord GOD  has sworn by his holiness:
|  The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets,
|  your children carried away in fish-baskets,
|  [4:3] and through the breaches in the city wall you will go,
|  thrown out on the garbage dump,
|  says the LORD .

##### Israel’s Failure to Understand the Lord’s Judgments #####

*********

|  [4:4] Come to Bethel and transgress,
|  At Gilgald increase your transgression;
|  And bring in the morning your sacrifices,
|  On the third day your tithes!

|  [4:5] And burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering,
|  And proclaim aloud the voluntary offerings,
|  For you love to do so, O Israelites!
|  It is the oracle of the Lord the LORD .

|  [4:6] But it was also I who gave to you
|  Empty stomachs in all your cities,
|  And lack of bread in all your palaces,
|  Yet ye have not returned to me, is the oracle of the LORD .

|  [4:7] I also it was who withheld from you the rain,
|  And I sent rain upon one city,
|  While upon another I did not let it rain,
|  [4:8] Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the LORD .

|  [4:9] I smote you with blight and mildew,
|  I laid waste your gardens and vineyards,
|  Your fig and your olive trees the young locust devoured;
|  Yet you did not return to me, is the oracle of the LORD .

|  [4:10] I sent among you a pestilence by the way of Egypt,
|  I slew your youths with the sword, taking captive your horses,
|  And I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils;
|  Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the LORD .

|  [4:11] I wrought a destruction among you,
|  As God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
|  And ye were as a brand plucked from the burning;
|  Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the LORD .

|  [4:12] Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel,
|  Because I am about to do this to thee,
|  Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

|  [4:13] For behold it is he who formeth the mountains,
|  And createth the wind,
|  And declareth to man what is his thought;
|  He maketh dawn and darkness,
|  And treadeth upon the heights of the earth,
|  the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name.

 [Amos 5] 

[5:1] 

##### Certain Destruction Awaiting Israel Unless She Seeks the Lord #####

|  Hear the word which I take up against you, even a dirge, O house of Israel:
|  [5:2] Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel!
|  Hurled down upon her own soil she lies, with none to raise her!

|  [5:3] For thus saith the Lord the LORD :
|  The city that taketh the field with a thousand hath but a hundred left,
|  And the one that taketh the field with a hundred bath but ten left.
|  [5:4] For thus saith the LORD  to the house of Israel:
|  Seek me and live,
|  [5:5] But seek not Bethel,
|  And Gilgal do not enter,
|  To Beersheba go not over;
|  For Gilgal shall taste the gall of exile,
|  And Bethel shall go to perdition.

|  [5:6] Seek the LORD  and live,
|  Lest he cast fire on the house of Joseph,
|  And it devour and there be none to quench it for Bethel.

|  [5:8] He it is who made the Pleades and Orions
|  Who turneth deep gloom into morning,
|  And darkeneth day again into night,
|  Who calleth the waters of the sea,
|  And poureth them out on the face of the earth,
|  [5:9] Who causeth destruction to burst over the strong,
|  And bringeth devastation upon the fortress,
|  the LORD  is his name.

##### A Solemn Warning to the Corrupt Judges #####

|  [5:7] Alas, for those who turn judgment to wormwood,
|  And east righteousness to the ground,
|  Who hate him that reproves in the gate,
|  And abhor one that speaks uprightly!

|  [5:11] Therefore, because ye trample upon the weak,
|  And take front him exactions of grain,
|  Houses of hewn stone have ye built,
|  But ye shall not dwell in them,
|  Charming vineyards have ye planted,
|  But ye shall not drink their wine.

|  [5:12] Surely I know how many are your transgressions,
|  And how great are your sins!
|  Ye persecutors of the righteous, takers of bribes!
|  Yea, the needy in the gated they thrust aside.

|  [5:13] Therefore since the prudent man at such a time keeps silent,
|  It is surely an evil time.
|  [5:14] Seek good and not evil,
|  That ye may live;
|  That this the LORD, God of hosts,
|  May be with you, as ye have said.

|  [5:15] Hate evil and love good,
|  And establish justice in the gate;
|  Perhaps the LORD  will be gracious,
|  The God of hosts, to a remnant of Joseph.

|  [5:16] Therefore thus saith the LORD  thee God of hosts:
|  In all squares there shall be wailing,
|  And in every street they shall say, "Alas! Alas!"
|  And they shall summon the husbandman to mourning,
|  And to wailing those skilled in lamentation,
|  [5:17] Yea, in all vineyards there shall be wailing,
|  When I pass through the midst of thee, saith the LORD .

##### Captivity Awaiting Corrupt Israel #####

|  [5:18] Alas, for those who long for the day of the LORD !
|  What have you to do with the day of the LORD ?
|  It is darkness, and not light.
|  [5:19] It is as when one flees from a lion,
|  And a bear falls upon him,
|  Or goes into the house and leans his hand upon the wall,
|  And a serpent bites him.
|  [5:20] Shall not the LORD ’s day be darkness and not light,
|  Yea, murky darkness without a ray of light in it?
|  [5:21] I hate, I despise your feasts,
|  And I will not smell the savor of your festivals,
|  [5:22] And with your cereal-offerings I will not be pleased,
|  And the peace-offerings of your fatlings I will not regard with favor.
|  [5:23] Banish from me the noise of your songs,
|  For to the melody of your lyres I will not listen.
|  [5:24] But let justice roll on as a flood of waters,
|  And righteousness like an unfailing stream.

|  [5:25] Was it only sacrifices and cereal-offerings ye brought me
|  In the wilderness during forty years, O house of Israel?
|  [5:26] But now ye shall lift up the shrine of your king,
|  And the image of your God which you have made for yourselves,
|  [5:27] And I will carry you away into exile beyond Damascus,
|  Saith the LORD  the God of hosts.

|  

 [Amos 6] 

[6:1] Alas for those who are careless in Zion,
|  And overconfident on the mountain of Samaria!
|  Men of mark of the first of the nations,
|  To whom the house of Israel resort!
|  [6:2] Pass over to Calneh and see,
|  And go from there to Hamath the great,
|  Then go down to Gath of the Philistines –
|  Are they better than these kingdoms,
|  Or is your territory larger than their territory?
|  [6:3] They who would postpone the day of calamity,
|  And yet have instituted a rule of violence.
|  [6:4] They who lie on ivory couches,
|  And sprawl upon their divans,
|  And eat lambs from the flock,
|  And calves from out the stall;
|  [6:5] They drawl to the sound of the lyre,
|  Like David, they devise for themselves instruments of song.
|  [6:6] They drink bowlfuls of wine,
|  And anoint themselves with the finest of oil,
|  But they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.

|  [6:7] Therefore now they must go into exile at the head of the captives,
|  And hushed shall be the revelry of the sprawlers,
|  [6:8] It is the oracle of the LORD, the God of hosts.
|  the LORD  hath sworn by himself:
|  I abhor the pride of Jacob,
|  And his palaces I hate,
|  Therefore I will deliver up the city and all that is in it,
|  [6:11] And one shall smite the great house into atoms,
|  And the small house into fragments.

|  [6:12] Do horses run upon crags?
|  Does one plow the sea with oxen?
|  That you turn justice into poison,
|  And, the fruit of righteousness into wormwood?
|  [6:13] Ye who rejoice in that which is not,
|  Who say, ’Have we not by our own strength taken horns for ourselves.
|  [6:14] Verily, I am now raising up against you,
|  O house of Israel, a nation;
|  And they shall oppress you,
|  From the entrance of Hamath
|  Even to the brook of the Arabah,
|  Is the oracle of the LORD, the God of hosts.

 [Amos 7] 

[7:1] 

##### Symbolic Pictures of the Impending Judgment #####

|  Thus the Lord the LORD  showed me,
|  And behold, he was forming locusts,
|  When the late spring grass began to come up.
|  [7:2] And when they were making an end
|  Of devouring the vegetation of the land,
|  I said, O Lord the LORD, forgive, I pray,
|  How can Jacob stand, for he is small?
|  [7:3] the LORD  relented concerning this;
|  It shall not be, said the LORD .

|  [7:4] Thus the Lord the LORD  showed me,
|  And behold, he was giving command to execute judgment,
|  By fire – the Lord the LORD .
|  And it devoured the great deep,
|  And had begun to devour the tilled land;
|  [7:5] Then I said, 0 Lord the LORD  cease, I pray,
|  How can Jacob stand for he is small? ’
|  [7:6] the LORD  relented concerning this;
|  Neither shall this be, said the LORD .

|  [7:7] Thus the Lord showed me,
|  And behold the Lord was standing
|  Beside a wall, with a plumb-line in his hand.
|  [7:8] And the LORD  said to me,
|  What dost thou see, Amos?
|  And I answered, A plumb-line,
|  Then the Lord said, Behold I am setting a plumb-line
|  In the midst of my people Israel,
|  I will not again pass by them any more.
|  [7:9] And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
|  The sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste,
|  And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

##### Amaziah’s Accusation and Amos’s Reply #####

[7:10] Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words."[7:11] For thus has Amos said, `Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’

[7:12] Also Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go flee away to the land of Judah, and there eat bread and there prophesy;[7:13] but you shall no longer prophesy at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal residence.

[7:14] Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, nor a son of a prophet; but I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamores;[7:15] but the LORD  took me from following the flock, and the LORD  said to me, Go, prophesy against my people Israel.

[7:16] Now therefore hear the word of the LORD : Thou sayest, "Thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, nor preach against the house of Isaac."[7:17] Therefore thus saith the LORD : Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die upon an unclean soil, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.

 [Amos 8] 

[8:1] 

##### The Symbolic Picture of Israel’s Approaching End #####

|  Thus the Lord the LORD  showed me,
|  And behold, a basket of summer fruit.
|  [8:2] Then he said, ’What dost thou see, Amos?’
|  And I said, ’A basket of summer fruit.’
|  And the LORD  said to me,’The end has come to my people Israel,
|  I will not again pass them by.’

|  [8:4] Hear this, you who trample upon the needy,
|  And oppress the poor of the earth, saying,
|  [8:5] When shall the new moon pass that we may sell grain,
|  And the sabbath that we may open the corn –
|  Making smaller the measure and enlarging the weight,
|  And perverting the false balances –
|  [8:6] And that we may sell the refuse of the corn!

|  [8:7] the LORD  bath sworn by the pride of Jacob, 
|  Never shall I forget all their deeds!        
|  [8:8] For this shall not the land tremble,       
|  And all her inhabitants mourn?       
|  Shall not the whole of it rise like the Nile,        
|  And sink like the Nile of Egypt?     

|  [8:9] And it shall come to pass in that day,     
|  It is the oracle of the Lord the LORD,
|  That I will make the sun set at noon 
|  And darken the earth in broad day,
|  And the singing-women of the palace shall wail,
|  It is the oracle of the Lord the LORD .
|  A multitude of carcasses! In every place they are cast!

|  [8:10] And I will turn your festivals into mourning,
|  And all your songs into dirges,
|  I will bring upon all loins sackcloth,
|  And upon every head baldness,
|  I will make it like the mourning for an only son,
|  And the end of it like a bitter day. 

|  [8:11] And I will send hunger in the land,
|  Not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water,        
|  But for hearing the word of the LORD .        
|  [8:12] Then shall they wander from sea to sea,   
|  From the north to the rising of the sun shall they run to and fro,
|  To seek the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.

|  [8:13] In that day shall faint   
|  The fairest maidens and the youths,  
|  [8:14] Who swear by the guilts of Samaria,       
|  And say, ’As liveth thy God, O Dan!  
|  And as liveth thy patron, O Beersheba!’      
|  And they shall fall, no more to rise!

 [Amos 9] 

[9:1] 

##### The Portrayal of the Final Destruction of the Nation #####

|  I saw the Lord standing by the altar;
|  And he said, Smite the capitals that the thresholds may shake,
|  Yea, break them off upon the head of all of them,
|  And the rest of them I will slay with the sword,
|  Not one of them shall escape,
|  Nor shall a refugee be delivered from among them.

|  [9:2] If they dig through to Sheol,
|  Thence will my hand take them;
|  And if they climb up to heaven,
|  Thence will I bring them down;
|  [9:3] And if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
|  Thence will I search them out and take them.

|  And if they hide out of my sight at the bottom of the sea,
|  Thence will I command the sea-serpent to bite them;
|  [9:4] And if they go-into captivity before their enemies,
|  Thence will I command the sword to slay them,
|  And I will keep my eye on them,
|  For evil and not for good.

|  [9:5] And it is the Lord the LORD  of hosts,
|  Who toucheth the earth and it melts,
|  And all who dwell in it mourn,
|  And all of it rises up like the Nile,
|  And sinks like the Nile of Egypt.
|  [9:6] He who buildeth his chambers in the heavens,
|  And hath established his vault upon the earth;
|  He that calleth for the waters of the sea.
|  And poureth them out upon the face of the earth
|  the LORD  is his name.

|  [9:7] Are ye not as the Cushites to me
|  O Israel? is the oracle of the LORD .
|  Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt,
|  And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
|  [9:8] Behold the eyes of the Lord the LORD  are upon the sinful kingdom,
|  And I will destroy it from the face of the earth.
|  Except that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob,
|  It is the oracle of the LORD .

##### The Glories of the Restoration #####

|  [9:9] For behold I am about to give command.
|  And I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations.
|  Just as one shakes grain in a sieve;
|  But not a kernel shall fall to the ground.
|  [9:10] By the sword shall die all the sinners of my people,
|  Who say, Disaster shall not touch or befall us.

|  [9:11] In that time I will raise up the hut of David that is fallen,
|  I will wall up its breaches and raise up its ruins,
|  And I will rebuild it as in the days of old,
|  [9:12] In order that they may possess the remnant of Edom,
|  And all the nations which were called by my name,
|  It is the oracle of the LORD, who will do this.

|  [9:13] Behold the days are coming, is the oracle of the LORD,
|  When the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
|  And the treader of grapes him who soweth seed;
|  The mountains also shall drop sweet wine.
|  And all the hills shall melt.

|  [9:14] And I will lead back the captivity of my people Israel,
|  And they shall rebuild waste cities and inhabit them.
|  And they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine,
|  And they shall make gardens and eat their fruit,
|  [9:15] And I will plant them upon their own soil.
|  And they shall never again be torn away from their land,
|  Which I have given them, saith the LORD  thy God.


The Vision of
-------------

Obadiah
=======

Concerning Edom
---------------

 [Obadiah 1] 

[1:1] The vision of Obadiah; what the LORD  said about Edom:

|  We have heard a report from the LORD,
|    a messenger has been sent among the nations;
|  Rise up, let us rise against Edom in battle!

|  [1:2] I will make you small among the nations,
|    and despised by all!
|  [1:3] Your proud heart has misled you,
|    you who live in the clefts of the rock,
|    you who build on high your dwelling.
|  You say to yourselves,
|    ‘Who can bring me down to earth?’
|  [1:4] Though you build high as the eagle,
|    though between the stars you set your nest,
|  from there will I bring you down,
|    says the LORD .

|  [1:5] If thieves had come to you, marauders by night
|    would they not have stolen only as much as they needed?
|  If grape-gatherers had come to you
|    would they not have left some gleanings?
|  [1:6] Descendents of Esau,
|    all your treasures are looted.
|  [1:7] To your border they have driven you,
|    all your allies have betrayed you.
|  Your avowed friends have overpowered you,
|    they have set a trap for you.
|  Where is your wisdom now?

[1:8] The LORD  says:

|  On that day,
|  I will destroy the wise of Edom,
|    drive wisdom out of Mount Esau.
|  [1:9] Your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman,
|    none will be left alive on Mount Esau.

|  [1:10] Because of the violence done to your relatives, the people of Jacob,
|    shame covers you,
|    you are cut off forever.
|  [1:11] In the day when you stood aloof,
|    in the day when strangers carried away their wealth,
|    and strangers entered into their gates,
|    and over Jerusalem cast lots,
|  you were as one of those strangers.

|  [1:12] You should not have gloated over your relatives,
|    in the day of their misfortune.
|  You should not have exulted over the land of Judah
|    in the day of their destruction.
|  You should not have laughed loudly
|    at their distress.
|  [1:13] You should not have entered in at the gate of my people
|    in the day of their disaster.
|  You should not have gloated over their calamity,
|    in the day of their disaster,
|  nor stretched out your hand after their wealth
|    in the day of their disaster,
|  [1:14] nor stood at the crossroads
|    to cut down their fugitives,
|  nor should you have betrayed their refugees
|    in the day of distress.

|  [1:15] Near at hand is the LORD ’s day for all the nations.
|  As you have done so will it be done to you.
|  Your deeds will come back on your own head.

|  [1:16] As you have drunk upon my holy mountain,
|    so all the nations will drink in turn;
|  They will drink deep
|    and be as though they had not been.

|  [1:17] But on Mount Zion some will escape,
|    it will be again holy,
|  and those of the house of Jacob
|    will again enter into their possessions.
|  [1:18] For the house of Jacob will be a fire,
|    and the house of Joseph a flame,
|  but the house of Esau will become stubble.
|    They will kindle and devour it.
|  Not even one of the house of Esau will escape,
|    for the LORD  has spoken.

|  [1:19] They will possess the Negeb and Mount Esau,
|    and the Shephelah of the Philistines.
|  They will possess the territory of Ephraim and Samaria,
|    and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
|  [1:20] The exiles of Israel will possess the land of the Canaanites
|    as far as Zarephath.
|  The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
|    will possess the cities of the Negreb.
|  [1:21] The rescued will come up on Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau,
|    and the kingdom will belong to the LORD .


Jonah
=====

 [Jonah 1] 

##### Jonah runs away #####

[1:1] This message from the LORD  came to Jonah, the son of Amittai:[1:2] “Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness is known to me.”[1:3] But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD . He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD .[1:4] But the LORD  made a furious wind blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in danger of breaking to pieces.[1:5] The sailors were terrified and each cried for help to his own god. They threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep.[1:6] The captain of the ship went and said to him, “How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think of us, so that we may not be lost.”

[1:7] The sailors said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah.[1:8] So they said to him, “Are you to blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?”[1:9] He replied, “I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”[1:10] Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, “What have you done?” For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

[1:11] Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy.[1:12] He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.”

[1:13] But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead.[1:14] So they cried to the LORD  and said, “We beg you, LORD, we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the LORD ; you have done as it pleases you.”[1:15] And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm.[1:16] Then the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him.

[1:17] But the LORD  arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.

##### Jonah’s song #####

 [Jonah 2] 

[2:1] Jonah prayed to the LORD  his God, out of the belly of the fish,[2:2] and said:

|  I cried out of my distress, to the LORD
|     and he answered me;
|  out of the midst of Sheol I cried aloud,
|    and you heard my voice.

|  [2:3] For you cast me into the deep,
|    into heart of the seas,
|    and the great flood rolled about me;
|  all your breakers and your waves
|    passed over me.

|  [2:4] Then I said, I am driven out,
|    away from your sight;
|  How will I ever again
|    look towards your holy temple?

|  [2:5] The waters surrounded me,
|    the great deep engulfed me,
|    the sea weeds were wrapped about my head.
|  [2:6] I went down to the roots of the mountains;
|    the prison of the earth closed over me forever.

|  Yet you brought up my life from destruction,
|    O LORD  my God.
|  [2:7] As my life slipped away,
|    I remembered the LORD ;
|  and my prayer reached you,
|    in your holy temple.

|  [2:8] Those who worship worthless idols
|    abandon their own mercy,
|  [2:9] but I will sacrifice to you
|    with loud thanksgiving!
|  I will pay that which I have vowed.
|    Salvation is the LORD ’s.

[2:10] And the LORD  spoke to the fish, and it threw up Jonah upon the dry land.

 [Jonah 3] 

##### The message to Nineveh #####

[3:1] This message from the LORD  came to Jonah the second time,[3:2] “Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.”[3:3] So Jonah started for Nineveh, as the LORD  commanded. Now Nineveh was so large a city that it took three days’ journey to cross it.[3:4] Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, and he proclaimed, “Forty days more and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”

[3:5] And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.[3:6] And when word came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes.[3:7] And he made this proclamation and published it in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: People, beast, herd, and flock shall not taste anything; let them not eat nor drink water.[3:8] Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and from the deeds of violence which they are doing.[3:9] Who knows? God may relent and avert his fierce anger, so that we may not die.”

[3:10] When God saw that they turned from their evil course, he relented the evil which he said he would do to them, and did not do it.

 [Jonah 4] 

##### Jonah sulks #####

[4:1] But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry.[4:2] He prayed to the LORD  and said, “Ah, LORD, wasn’t this what I said when I was still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and ready to forgive.[4:3] Therefore, LORD, I beg you, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live!”[4:4] But the LORD  said, “Are you doing right in being angry?”

[4:5] Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would become of the city.[4:6] And the LORD  arranged for a bush to grow up over Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave Jonah great pleasure;[4:7] but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted.[4:8] And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah’s head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.”[4:9] But God said to Jonah, “Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?” He replied, “I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!”

##### Jonah is rebuked #####

[4:10] The LORD  said, “You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in a night.[4:11] Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left; and many cattle too?”


Micah
=====

 [Micah 1] 

##### The Superscription to Micah’s Sermons #####

[1:1] The LORD ’s message which came to Micah of Morsheth in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The visions he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem.

##### The Lord’s Judgment on Guilty Samaria and Judah #####

|  [1:2] Listen, all you peoples!
|  Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth!
|  For the Lord GOD  will be a witness against you,
|  the Lord from his holy temple!

|  [1:3] The LORD  is coming from his holy place,
|  he descends and treads on the heights of the earth,
|  [1:4] so that the mountains melt beneath
|  like wax in the presence of the fire,
|  and the valleys break apart
|  like water poured down a steep descent.

|  [1:5] All this is because of the crime of Jacob,
|  and for the sin of the house of Israel.
|  What was the crime of Jacob?
|  Was it not Samaria?
|  What is the sin of Judah?
|  Is it not Jerusalem?

|  [1:6] “I will make Samaria a ruin in an open field,
|  and a place where a vineyard is planted,
|  I will hurl down her stones into the valley,
|  and lay bare her foundations.

|  [1:7] “All her images will be shattered,
|  and all her statues will be burned with fire,
|  and all her idols I will lay in ruins.
|  For they were acquired by prostitution,
|  and to prostitution they will return.”

|  [1:8] This is why I will mourn and wail,
|  I will go barefoot and naked,
|  I will howl like the jackals
|  and mourn like the desert owl.

|  [1:9] For the blow that Samaria has received is incurable.
|  It has spread over Judah,
|  it extends even to the gate of my people,
|  even to Jerusalem.

|  [1:10] Don’t tell this in Gath!
|  Don’t even cry – but sit in the dust at Beth-leaphrah.
|  [1:11] Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed!
|  The inhabitants of Zaanan cannot leave their city.
|  Beth-ezel laments and removes its support from you.
|  [1:12] The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good!
|  But the LORD  has sent disaster to the gates of Jerusalem.
|  [1:13] Harness the horse to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish.
|  You led the daughter of Zion, Jerusalem, into sin,
|  in you are found the crimes of Israel.
|  [1:14] Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath.
|  Beth-achzib will betray the kings of Israel.
|  [1:15] I will hand you to a conqueror, people of Mareshah,
|  the leaders of Israel will hide in Adullam Cave!
|  [1:16] Shave your head in morning for the children you love,
|  until you are bald as vultures, because they have left you for exile.

 [Micah 2] 

##### The Oppression of the Poor #####

|  [2:1] Woe to those who lie awake planning evil,
|  who in the light of morning carry out their plan
|  because they have the power to do it.
|  [2:2] They covet fields and seize them,
|  desire houses and take them,
|  they crush householder and his household,
|  people and their possessions.

|  [2:3] Therefore the LORD  says:
|  “I am planning disaster from which you cannot save your neck,
|  nor walk proudly because it will be a terrible time.
|  [2:4] On that day they will sing a taunt-song to you,
|  this mocking lament:
|  ‘My people’s estate is being measured for sale,
|  our captors are dividing our fields.
|  We are completely undone.’
|  [2:5] There will be no one to measure out land for you
|  from the LORD ’s community.

|  [2:6] “‘Don’t rant!’ they urge, ‘Of such things one does not prophesy!
|  Shame will not overtake us!
|  [2:7] Is the LORD  impatient, or are such things his deeds?
|  Are not his words favorable to the family of Jacob?’

|  Aren’t my commands good for those who obey them?
|  [2:8] But you, you stand up as a foe against those who are peaceful;
|  you strip the robe from those who pass by quietly, averse to conflict.
|  [2:9] Women of my people you drive out from their happy homes,
|  from their young children you take away my glory forever.
|  [2:10] Rise and begone, for this is no place to rest.
|  Your uncleanness brings destruction, severe destruction.
|  [2:11] If a person walking in wine and falsehood were to say,
|  ‘I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink,’
|  then he would be the perfect prophet for this people!”

##### The Lord Leading Back His Scattered People #####

|  [2:12] “I will assuredly assemble all of Jacob,
|  I will surely gather the survivors of Israel.
|  I will herd them together as sheep in a fold,
|  like a flock in the pasture,
|  and the land will resound with the sounds of multitudes.

|  [2:13] “The one who breaks out goes first.
|  They have broken forth and passed by the gate
|  and through it have they gone out.
|  Their king leads before them,
|  the LORD  at their head.”

 [Micah 3] 

##### The Crimes of Judah’s Civil and Spiritual Leaders #####

|  [3:1] I also said:
|  “Listen now, leaders of Jacob,
|  judges of the house of Israel.
|  Is it not your duty to know what is the right?
|  [3:2] Haters of that which is good and lovers of evil!

|  [3:3] “They devour the flesh of my people,
|  and their hide they strip from off them,
|  and break in pieces and serve up their bones,
|  like meat in a pot or the cooking-pan!

|  [3:4] “Then they will cry out to the LORD,
|  but he will not pay attention to them.
|  He will hide his face from them at that time
|  because they have committed such crimes.”

|  [3:5] Therefore the LORD  says:
|  “To the prophets who lead my people astray,
|  who when they have food between their teeth declare peace,
|  but against one who puts nothing in their mouths,
|  they proclaim an open war!

|  [3:6] “Night will overtake you so that you have no vision,
|  and darkness so that there will be no divination,
|  and the sun will go down on the prophets,
|  and the day shall be dark over them.

|  [3:7] “The seers will be ashamed,
|  and the diviners will turn pale,
|  all of them will cover their mouths.
|  For there will be no answer from God.

|  [3:8] “But I, on the contrary am full of power,
|  and the sense of justice and strength,
|  to make known to Jacob his crime,
|  and to Israel his sin.

|  [3:9] “Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob,
|  judges of the house of Israel,
|  you who spurn justice,
|  and make all that is straight crooked,
|  [3:10] who build Zion with acts of bloodshed,
|  and Jerusalem with crime.

|  [3:11] “The leaders render judgment for a bribe,
|  and her priests give oracles for a reward,
|  and her prophets divine for silver.
|  Yet they claim to rely on the LORD,
|  ‘The LORD ’, they say, ‘is in our midst.
|  Evil cannot overtake us.’

|  [3:12] “Therefore for your sakes
|  Zion will be plowed as a field,
|  and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
|  and the temple mount a wooded height.”

 [Micah 4] 

##### The Peace and World-wide Renown of Zion #####

|  [4:1] In the days to come
|  the mountain of the LORD  will be established,
|  the house of our God on the top of the mountain,
|  lifted above the hills.

|  All the nations will flow to it,
|  [4:2] and many peoples will go and say,
|  “Come, let us go up to the LORD ’s mount,
|  to the house of the God of Jacob,
|  so that he may instruct us in his ways,
|  so that we may walk in his paths.”
|  For from Zion proceeds instruction
|  and the LORD ’s word from Jerusalem.

|  [4:3] He will arbitrate between many peoples,
|  and render decisions for numerous nations,
|  They will beat their swords into ploughshares,
|  and their spears into pruning hooks.
|  Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
|  they will learn war no more.
|  [4:4] They will live each under his vine,
|  and under his fig-tree, with none to terrify them.
|  For the mouth of the LORD  of hosts has spoken.

|  [4:5] Each nation trusts in the names of their gods,
|  but we will worship the LORD  our God forever.

|  [4:6] “On that day,” says the LORD,
|  “I will assemble the lame.
|  I will gather exiles I punished.
|  [4:7] I will restore the lame as a remnant,
|  the exiles into a great nation.
|  The LORD  will rule over them
|  on Mount Zion from that time forever.”
|  [4:8] But you, watchtower for the flock,
|  hill of the daughter of Zion,
|  to you will return your former rule.
|  [4:9] So why do you now cry aloud? Haven’t you any king?
|  Or has your counselor perished, so you writhe in pain like a woman in labor?

|  [4:10] Writhe and scream, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor!
|  For now you must leave the city and camp in the open field.
|  You will be taken to Babylon, but there will be rescued.
|  There the LORD  will save you from the hands of your foes.

|  [4:11] But now many nations gather against you.
|  They say, “Let her be defiled, we will gloat over Zion.”
|  [4:12] But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD .
|  They do not understand his plan,
|  for he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor.

|  [4:13] “Arise, thresh, daughter of Zion.
|  I will make your horns iron,
|  and your hoofs brass,
|  so you might beat in pieces many peoples,
|  and devote to the LORD  their spoil,
|  and their wealth to the ruler of all the earth.

 [Micah 5] 

|  [5:1] “Now cut yourself in bitter grief,
|  daughter besieged by soldiers.
|  They have set a wall around you.
|  They strike the ruler of Israel,
|  in the face with a rod.

|  [5:2] “Bethlehem in Ephrathah,
|  small among the tribes of Judah,
|  from you will come a king
|  who will rule for me over Israel,
|  whose family line goes back to the distant past.”

|  [5:3] So the LORD  will only abandon Israel to its enemies
|  until the woman in labor gives birth.
|  Then the survivors will be reunited with their own people.

|  [5:4] And he will stand and shepherd by the strength of the LORD,
|  In the exalted name of the LORD  his God;
|  And they will live in security, for now he will be great,
|  even to the ends of the earth.

|  [5:5] This will be our peace:
|  when Assyria comes into our land
|  and treads on our soil,
|  we will raise up against him seven shepherds,
|  eight leaders of men.
|  [5:6] They will shepherd Assyria with a sword,
|  and the land of Nimrod with bared blades.
|  They will deliver us from Assyria,
|  when they come into our land,
|  and tread within our borders.

|  [5:7] And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations,
|  in the midst of many peoples,
|  like dew from the LORD,
|  like showers on the grass,
|  which don’t wait for people to come
|  or linger for mortals.

|  [5:8] And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations,
|  in the midst of many peoples,
|  like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
|  like a young lion among the sheep-folds,
|  who, when he passes through, pounces.
|  He savages his prey. There is no rescuer.
|  [5:9] Let your hand triumph over your adversaries,
|  let all your enemies be cut off.

|  [5:10] On that day, says the LORD :
|  “I will slaughter your horses from your midst,
|  and destroy your chariots.
|  [5:11] I will devastate the cities in your land,
|  and tear down your fortresses.
|  [5:12] I will destroy your magic charms,
|  and you will have no soothsayers.
|  [5:13] I will cut down your idols and sacred pillars,
|  and you will not worship any more the work of your hands.
|  [5:14] I will uproot your sacred poles,
|  and destroy your idols.
|  [5:15] In my wrath and my anger
|  I will seek vengeance on the nations that ignore me.”

 [Micah 6] 

##### Israel’s False Conception of the Lord’s Character and Demands #####

|  [6:1] Hear now what the LORD  is saying:
|  Arise, present your complaint before the mountains,
|  let the hills hear your voice!
|  [6:2] Hear, mountains, the LORD ’s accusation,
|  listen, foundations of the earth.
|  For the LORD  has a case against his people.
|  He has a dispute with Israel.

|  [6:3] “My people, what have I done to you.
|  How have I displeased you? Answer me!
|  [6:4] For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
|  from the land of slavery I redeemed you.
|  I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
|  [6:5] My people, what did Balak, king of Moab counsel?
|  And how did Balaam, the son of Beor, answer him?
|  Remember now the journey from Shittim to Gilgal,
|  so that you might realize the just deeds of the LORD .”

|  [6:6] With what should I come before the LORD ?
|  Bow myself before the God on high?
|  Should I come before him with burnt-offerings,
|  with calves a year old?
|  [6:7] Will the LORD  be pleased with thousands of rams,
|  With ten thousand streams of oil?
|  Should I give him my first-born son for my guilt,
|  the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

|  [6:8] The LORD  has told you what is good,
|  what he demands of you:
|  Only to do justice and love mercy,
|  and to walk humbly with your God.

##### Guilt and Punishment of Jerusalem #####

|  [6:9] Listen! The LORD  calls to the city!
|  Listen, tribe and assembly of the city!

|  [6:10] “Can I forget the hoarded treasures in the houses of the wicked,
|  and the accursed scant measure?
|  [6:11] Can I leave her unpunished because of evil scales,
|  and the bag of false weights?
|  [6:12] Whose rich people are full of violence,
|  her inhabitants liars,
|  whose tongues speak deceit?

|  [6:13] “But I indeed, have begun to punish you,
|  to lay you in ruins because of your sins.
|  [6:14] You will eat but not be satisfied,
|  your stomach empty within you.
|  You will store up but lose everything,
|  because whatever you save I will give to the sword.
|  [6:15] You will sow but not reap.
|  You will tread the olives but have no oil for rubbing,
|  tread grapes but drink no wine!

|  [6:16] “For you have followed the commands of Omri,
|  and all the practices of the house of Ahab.
|  You have acted in accord with their counsels,
|  so I will give you up to ruin,
|  the city’s inhabitants to derision.
|  The nations will treat you with contempt!”

 [Micah 7] 

##### The Utter Degeneracy of the People #####

|  [7:1] Woe, woe is me, for I have become
|  like a field after harvest,
|  like a vineyard after gathering;
|  not a cluster of grapes to eat,
|  not a fig that anyone desires.

|  [7:2] The honest have perished from the land,
|  of the upright among people there is none.
|  All of them lie in wait to shed blood.
|  They hunt one another with the net.

|  [7:3] Their hands know well how to do evil,
|  the officer and judge demands a bribe,
|  the high official decides as he pleases
|  and they conspire to pervert justice.

|  [7:4] The best of them are like a thorn thicket,
|  their most upright like a prickly hedge.
|  The day of their punishment has come,
|  now will be their confusion!

|  [7:5] Do not trust your neighbor,
|  do not rely on a friend.
|  From the wife who lies in your arms
|  guard your tongue.

|  [7:6] For son insults father,
|  daughter rises up against mother,
|  daughter-in-law against mother-in-law,
|  a man’s enemies are the people of his own household.

##### Zion’s Ultimate Vindication and Exaltation #####

|  [7:7] But I will look to the LORD,
|  I will wait for the God of my salvation.
|  My God will hear me!
|  [7:8] Do not rejoice over me, my enemy.
|  If I have fallen, I will rise.
|  If I sit in darkness, the LORD  is my light.
|  [7:9] The anger of the LORD  I will bear,
|  for against him have I sinned –
|  until he champions my cause
|  and gives judgment for me.
|  He will bring me into to the light,
|  I will see his justice.
|  [7:10] So my enemy will see, and shame will cover them,
|  they who said, “Where is the LORD  your God?”
|  I will look upon them,
|  they will be trampled on like mud in the street!

|  [7:11] It is a day for rebuilding your walls,
|  this day will your boundary will be extended.
|  [7:12] This day they will come to you,
|  from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
|  and from Egypt even to the Euphrates River,
|  from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
|  [7:13] Though the land has become a desolation
|  because of its inhabitants, because of their deeds.

|  [7:14] Shepherd your flock with your staff, the flock that belong to you,
|  who live alone in the forest, in the midst of meadows;
|  so that they may pasture in Bashon and Gilead as in the days of old,
|  [7:15] as in the days when you came from Egypt, gave us wonders to see.
|  [7:16] Nations will see and be ashamed of all their might;
|  they will put their hands to their mouth, their ears will become deaf,
|  [7:17] they will lick the dust like snakes, like creatures that crawl on the earth;
|  they will come trembling and in terror from their hiding places, in dread and fear.

|  [7:18] Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity
|  and passing by the rebellion of the remnant of your people?
|  He does not retain his anger forever, but is one who delights in mercy.
|  [7:19] He will tread under foot our iniquity;
|  you will cast into the depths of the sea all our iniquities.
|  [7:20] You will show faithfulness to Jacob, and loving kindness to Abraham,
|  as you have sworn to our ancestors from the days of old.


Nahum
=====

 [Nahum 1] 

[1:1] A message about Nineveh, a vision which came to Nahum from Elkosh.

##### God’s wrath #####

|  [1:2] The LORD  tolerates no rivals.
|    The LORD  is vengeful and fierce in wrath.
|  The LORD  does not fail to punish his foes;
|    the LORD  is vengeful against his enemies.
|  [1:3] The LORD  is slow to anger,
|    great in power.
|  The guilty will not escape
|    his punishment.

|  Storm tempest is his path
|    and cloud is the dust of his feet.
|  [1:4] He rebukes the sea and dries it up
|    and makes all the streams run dry.
|  Bashan and Carmel are languishing
|    and the bloom of Lebanon is withered.

|  [1:5] The mountains tremble before him
|    and the hills dissolve.
|  The earth heaves before him,
|    the world and all who live in it.

|  [1:6] Who can stand before his wrath?
|    Who can withstand the heat of his anger?
|  His fierce fury pours forth like fire,
|    he shatters rocks.

|  [1:7] The LORD  is good to those who hope in him,
|    a place of refuge in the day of trouble.

|  [1:8] With rushing flood an end he makes
|    of those who rise against him,
|  he drives his enemies into darkness.

|  [1:9] Why do you plot against the LORD ?
|    He will end you.
|    He only takes vengeance once.

|  [1:10] Thorns, tangled and drenched,
|    they are consumed like dry stubble.

|  [1:11] Nineveh! From you has arisen
|    one who plots evil against the LORD,
|    a counsellor of wickedness.

##### Good news for Judah #####

[1:12] The LORD  says:

|  “Though they are many and strong,
|    they will pass away and be gone.
|  Though I have afflicted you,
|    I will afflict you no more,
|  [1:13] and now I will break his yoke from your necks
|    and snap your chains.”

[1:14] The LORD  has given this command concerning you, Nineveh:

|  “Your name will no longer be remembered.
|  I will destroy every idol and image
|    in the house of your God.
|  I will destroy even your tomb,
|    for you are worthless.”

|  [1:15] Look! On the mountains a messenger
|    bringing good news,
|    announcing peace!
|  “Celebrate the feasts, Judah,
|    fulfill your vows.
|  Never again will these enemies invade your land,
|    they are destroyed!”

 [Nahum 2] 

##### Destruction of the city #####

|  [2:1] Nineveh! The destroyer has come up against you;
|    mount guard upon the rampart;
|    watch the road; brace yourselves;
|    strengthen your might to the utmost.

|  [2:2] For the LORD  is restoring the majesty of Jacob
|    and of Israel,
|  though the devastators have plundered them
|    and destroyed their vines.

|  [2:3] The shields of his warriors are dyed red,
|    his soldiers are clothed in scarlet,
|  his chariots gleam like fire
|    on the day he prepares for battle
|    spears are shaken.

|  [2:4] Chariots rush across the fields,
|    storm through the squares;
|  they flame like torches,
|    they dart like lightening.

|  [2:5] A leader rallies his nobles,
|    they hurl themselves forward.
|  They speed on toward the wall;
|    the storming-shield is set up.

|  [2:6] The water-gates are thrown open,
|    and the palace dissolves in ruins.
|  [2:7] The queen is stripped,
|    she is carried off.
|  Her maids moan like doves,
|    beating upon their breasts.

|  [2:8] Like a pool of water is Nineveh,
|    her waters fast ebbing away.
|  “Stand firm! Stand firm!” someone cries,
|    but no one turns back.

|  [2:9] “Loot the silver, loot the gold,
|    for there is no end to the treasure,
|    the wealth and precious things.”

|  [2:10] Nineveh is empty, desolate, devastated,
|    with faint heart and knocking knee.
|  There is weakness in every limb,
|    and faces grow pale.

|  [2:11] Where now is the den of lions?
|    Where now the lair of their young?
|  Where the lion used to withdraw,
|    with his cubs, with none to disturb them?

|  [2:12] The lion tore enough for his cubs,
|    and strangled prey for his lionesses.
|  He filled his caves with the kill,
|    he filled his lairs with fresh meat.

|  [2:13] “But see, I am against you,”
|    the LORD  of hosts declares,
|  “I will burn your chariots in smoke and fire.
|    The sword will devour your young lions.
|  You will never again prey on the land.
|    No more will your messengers be heard.”

 [Nahum 3] 

##### Ruin #####

|  [3:1] Woe to the bloody city!
|    Full of lies and plunder,
|    without end is the spoil.
|  [3:2] Hear the crack of the whip,
|    hear the rattle of wheels.
|  Galloping horses,
|    jolting chariots.
|  [3:3] Horsemen charging,
|    swords flashing,
|    spears glittering,
|  a multitude of slain,
|    a heap of bodies,
|  no end to the corpses
|    over which people stumble!

|  [3:4] “Because you acted like a whore,
|    bewitching the nations,
|    enticing the peoples,
|  [3:5] I am against you, Nineveh”
|    the LORD  of hosts declares.
|  “I will strip your clothes
|    and show the nations your nakedness,
|    and the kingdoms your shame.

|  [3:6] “I will fling loathsome filth at you,
|    and make you an object of contempt,
|    a spectacle,
|  [3:7] so that everyone who sees you
|    will flee from you and say:
|  ‘Nineveh is laid waste,
|    who will mourn for her?’

|  [3:8] “Are you any better than Thebes,
|    which stood on the banks of the Nile,
|  with waters around as a rampart,
|    whose wall was the sea of waters?
|  [3:9] Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt.
|    The Libyans were her helpers,
|    and Put with its countless people.
|  [3:10] Yet she was exiled
|    and made captive.
|  On all corners of the streets
|    her infants were dashed to pieces.
|  Lots were cast for her nobles,
|    all her great ones were bound in chains.

|  [3:11] “You too, Nineveh, will be drunk with fear;
|    you too will seek a place of escape from the foe.
|  [3:12] All your fortresses are fig-trees with the first ripe figs;
|    if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!
|  [3:13] Your troops are weak as women before your foes;
|    the gates of your land are wide open;
|    your defenses burned down.

|  [3:14] “Draw water for the siege,
|    strengthen your forts.
|  Go to the clay pits and tread the clay;
|    take up the brick moulds.
|  [3:15] There the fire will consume you,
|    the sword will cut you down.

|  Multiply like the locust
|    or a swarm of grasshoppers.
|  [3:16] Increase the numbers of your merchants
|    until they are more than the stars of heaven,
|  [3:17] until your watchmen are locusts,
|    and your scribes like grasshoppers,
|    which swarm in the hedges on a cold day;
|  but when the sun rises
|    they fly away,
|    no one knows where.

|  [3:18] “King of Assyria:
|    your princes slumber,
|    your nobles sleep!
|  Your people are scattered on the mountains
|    with no one to gather them!
|  [3:19] There is no healing for your hurt,
|    your wound is incurable.
|  All who hear of your fate clap their hands in joy,
|    for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?”


Habakkuk
========

 [Habakkuk 1] 

##### Habakkuk’s message #####

[1:1] The message seen by the prophet Habakkuk.

##### (Habbakuk) #####

|  [1:2] How long, LORD, have I cried out
|    and without you hearing me!
|  I cry to you, “Violence!”
|    but you do not help.
|  [1:3] Why do you make me look upon wickedness
|    and behold trouble?
|  Destruction and violence are before my eyes,
|    and fighting and quarrelling.

|  [1:4] Therefore the law is weak,
|    and justice is never rendered;
|  for the wicked surround the righteous,
|    so that justice is perverted.

##### (The Lord) #####

|  [1:5] Look at the nations, look well,
|    be shocked and amazed.
|  For I am about to do a work in your days;
|    you will not believe it when it is told.

|  [1:6] For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans,
|    a nation grim and quick of action
|  who sweep over the whole breadth of the earth
|    to seize dwellings not their own.
|  [1:7] They bring fear and terror.
|    They write their own rules.
|  [1:8] Their horses are swifter than leopards,
|    quicker than wolves hunting at dusk.
|  From afar they come swooping down,
|    like an eagle attacking its prey.
|  [1:9] They all come to do violence,
|    a horde like a desert wind,
|    they gather up captives like sand.

|  [1:10] At kings they scoff,
|    and princes are sport to them.
|  They laugh at every fortress,
|    and heap up earth to take it.
|  [1:11] Then they sweep on like the wind,
|    Their strength is their god.

##### (Habbakuk) #####

|  [1:12] Are you not eternal, LORD,
|    my holy one, who does not die?
|  LORD  you have appointed them to execute judgment,
|    my rock, you have established them to punish.
|  [1:13] Your eyes are too pure to look at evil,
|    you cannot condone iniquity.
|  So why do you regard the treacherous in silence,
|    while the wicked swallows the upright?

|  [1:14] You have made people like the fish of the sea,
|    like reptiles that have no ruler.
|  [1:15] The wicked sweep them all into their nets,
|    and gather them into their drag-nets,
|    and rejoice and celebrate.
|  [1:16] Therefore they sacrifice to their net,
|    and burn offerings to their drag-net;
|  for by their nets are their portions generous,
|    and their food is rich.
|  [1:17] Will they empty their nets continually,
|    slaughter nations unpityingly?

 [Habakkuk 2] 

|  [2:1] I will take my stand on my watch-tower,
|    and station myself on a turret.
|  I will watch to see what the LORD  will say to me,
|    what answer he will make to my complaint.

##### (The Lord) #####

|  [2:2] Then the LORD  answered me and said:
|  Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets,
|    so that even someone running by could read it.
|  [2:3] Though the vision waits for the time set,
|    it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail;
|  Though it linger long, wait for it.
|    For it surely will come and will not be delayed.

|  [2:4] The strength of the proud fails,
|    but the upright lives by their faithfulness.

|  [2:5] Wealth is treacherous,
|    the arrogant never have enough.
|  They make their desire as wide as Sheol,
|    are like death, unsatisfied,
|  For they gather to themselves all the nations,
|    bring together to themselves all peoples.
|  [2:6] Shouldn’t everyone mock them?
|    sing a taunt-song against them, and say:

|  Woe to the person who amasses what is not theirs,
|    and loads them self down with goods taken in pledge!
|  [2:7] Won’t your creditors suddenly rise,
|    and those who will overthrow you awake,
|    and you become their prey?
|  [2:8] For as you have plundered many peoples,
|    the survivors will prey upon you.
|  You have shed blood and committed violence
|    to the earth, peoples and their cities.

|  [2:9] Woe to you who seeks unjust gain for your dynasty,
|  who sets your nest on high to be safe from the reach of misfortune!

|  [2:10] You have planned only shame for your dynasty.
|  You have destroyed many peoples,
|    and brought guilt upon yourself;
|  [2:11] the stone will cry out from the wall,
|    and the beam from the timber will answer it.

|  [2:12] Woe to the person who builds a city by bloodshed,
|    and founds a town by crime
|  [2:13] while the peoples toil for what fires will consume,
|    and the nations weary themselves for nothing!

This the LORD  of hosts has said,[2:14] and the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the LORD  as the seas are full of water.

|  [2:15] Woe to him who in fury gives drink to his neighbor
|    to make him drunk, and see him naked.
|  [2:16] You are filled with shame, not glory;
|    drink yourself and be uncovered.
|  The cup from the LORD ’s hand
|    will pass in turn to you,
|    and shame will cover your glory!

|  [2:17] For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
|    the destruction of animals will terrify you,
|  because you shed people’s blood on the earth,
|    destroyed people and their cities.

|  [2:18] What use is an idol?
|  A human made it,
|    a metal image.
|  It cannot speak,
|    it cannot teach truth,
|  Why does its maker trust it?

|  [2:19] Woe to the person who says to a block, awake!
|    to a dumb stone, arise!
|  What can it teach?
|  It may be set with gold and silver,
|    but there is no breath at all within it.
|  [2:20] The LORD  is in his holy temple.
|    Let all the earth be silent before him!

 [Habakkuk 3] 

##### Habakkuk’s psalm #####

[3:1] A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Shigionoth.

|  [3:2] I have heard, LORD, of your fame,
|    I have seen, LORD, your work;
|  through the years you have make yourself known,
|    in wrath you remember mercy.

|  [3:3] God comes from Teman,
|    and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran. *Selah*
|  His glory covers the heavens,
|    and his splendor fills the earth.
|  [3:4] Before him it is like the light,
|    rays he has at his side,
|    where his power is hidden.
|  [3:5] Before him pestilence stalks,
|    after him plague follows.

|  [3:6] He stands, and the earth trembles,
|    he looks, and the nations melt away,
|  and the mountains of old are scattered,
|    the everlasting hills bow down.
|  These are his ways from of old.
|  [3:7] The tents of Cushan are afraid,
|    the curtains of Midian tremble.

|  [3:8] Is your wrath, LORD, with the rivers?
|    Is your anger against the streams?
|    Or your rage against the sea?
|  Is that why you ride on your war-steeds?
|    Why you mount your chariots of victory?
|  [3:9] Why you bare your bow?
|    Why you fill your quiver with shafts?

|  You split the earth with torrents.
|    [3:10] The mountains see you and writhe.
|  The tempest of waters sweeps by.
|    The great deep sends forth its voice,
|    and lifts up its hands.
|  [3:11] The sun forgets to rise.
|    The moon stands still in its place.

|  Your arrows go forth to give light.
|    Your glittering spear is as lightning.
|  [3:12] In rage you stride over the earth.
|    In wrath you trample the nations.
|  [3:13] You go forth to save your people.
|    You go to help your anointed.
|  You crush the head of the wicked nation,
|    laying him bare from thigh to neck. *Selah*
|  [3:14] You pierced his head with his spears,
|    as his champions storm out to scatter us,
|    as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly.
|  [3:15] You tread the sea with your horses,
|    while the mighty waters roar.

|  [3:16] I hear, and my body trembles,
|    and at the sound my lips quiver.
|  My bones begin to decay,
|    and my footsteps totter beneath me,
|  while I long for the day of distress
|    to come upon those who attack us.

|  [3:17] Though the fig-tree bears no fruit,
|    and there are no grapes on the vines,
|  though the olive harvest fails,
|    and the fields produce no food,
|  though the flock is cut off from the fold,
|    and there is no herd in the stalls,
|  [3:18] yet I will exult in the LORD,
|    and rejoice in the God who saves me.
|  [3:19] The Lord GOD  is my strength;
|    he makes my feet as sure as the feet of deer,
|    and causes me to walk on the heights!

Zephaniah
=========

 [Zephaniah 1] 

[1:1] The LORD ’s message, which came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the time of Josiah of Judah who was son of Amon.

##### The Day of Judgment on Judah #####

|  [1:2] I will utterly destroy everything
|    from off the face of the earth,
|      says the LORD .
|  [1:3] I will sweep away human and animal,
|    the birds of the sky
|    and the fish of the sea.
|  I will cause the wicked to stumble,
|    and I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth,
|      says the LORD .

|  [1:4] I will stretch out my hand over Judah
|    and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
|  and I will cut off from this place the last remnant of Baal
|    and the name of the heathen priests,
|  [1:5] and those who worship on the housetops
|    to the stars in the sky,
|  and those worshippers of the LORD
|     who also pay homage to Milcom,
|  [1:6] and those who turn back
|    from following the LORD,
|  And those who do not seek the LORD
|     nor strive to find him.

|  [1:7] Be silent before the Lord GOD ,
|    for near is the day of the LORD,
|  for the LORD  has prepared a sacrifice,
|    he has sanctified his guests.

|  [1:8] On the day of the LORD’S  sacrifice:
|  I will punish the officers and the royal princes,
|    and all those who clothe themselves in foreign apparel.

|  [1:9] On that day:
|  I will punish all who leap over the threshold,
|    who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.

|  [1:10] Listen on that day, says the LORD :
|  A cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,
|    and a wailing from the New Quarter,
|    and a great din from the hills.

|  [1:11] Those who live in the Mortar wail,
|    for all the traders are silenced,
|    the money counters wiped out.

|  [1:12] I will search Jerusalem with a lamp,
|    I will punish those who are at ease,
|  who sit comfortably with their wine,
|    who say to themselves,
|  “the LORD  brings neither prosperity nor calamity.”

|  [1:13] Their wealth will become a prey
|    and their houses a desolation.
|  Though they build houses,
|    they will not inhabit them;
|  though they plant vineyards,
|    they will not drink wine from them.

|  [1:14] Near is the day of the LORD !
|    Near and rapidly approaching!
|  Near is the bitter day of the LORD,
|    and the scream of the warrior.

|  [1:15] That day is a day of wrath,
|    a day of trouble and distress,
|  a day of destruction and desolation,
|    a day of darkness and gloom,
|  a day of clouds and thick darkness,
|    [1:16] a day of the trumpet and battle-cry,
|  against the fortified cities
|    and against the high battlements.

|  [1:17] And I will bring distress upon the people
|    and they will walk as the blind,
|    because they have sinned against the LORD,
|  and their blood will be poured out as dust
|    and their flesh as dung.

[1:18] Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them. For in the day of the wrath of the LORD  and in the fire of his fury the whole earth will be consumed. For he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the earth.

 [Zephaniah 2] 

##### The Imminent Judgment upon the Nations #####

|  [2:1] Be ashamed within yourselves, be ashamed,
|    [2:2] before you become as the drifting chaff,
|    before the anger of the LORD  comes upon you,
|    before the day of the LORD ’s wrath comes upon you.
|  [2:3] Seek the LORD  all you meek of the earth,
|    you who obey his law;
|  Seek righteousness, seek meekness;
|    perhaps you may be hidden in the day of the LORD ’s wrath.

|  [2:4] For Gaza will be forsaken;
|    Ashkelon a desolation;
|  Ashdod – by noon will they rout her
|    and Ekron be torn up!
|  [2:5] Woe to those who live by the sea coast,
|    people of the Cherethites!
|  The word of the LORD  is against you,
|    Canaan, land of the Philistines!

I will destroy you so that you will be without inhabitants,[2:6] and you will become shepherds’ cots and folds for flocks.[2:7] The sea coast will belong to the survivors of the house of Judah.They will pasture their flocks there. In the house of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening. The LORD  their God will be with them and restore their fortunes.

|  [2:8] I have heard the taunts of Moab,
|    and the revilings of the Ammonites,
|  how they have taunted my people,
|    and spoken boastfully concerning their border.
|  [2:9] Therefore as I live, says the LORD  of hosts, the God of Israel:
|    Moab will be like Sodom,
|      and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,
|    a breeding-place of nettles, and saltpits,
|      and a desolation, forever;
|    the residue of my people will plunder them,
|      and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.
|  [2:10] This will they have for their pride,
|    because they have taunted and spoken boastfully
|    against the people of the LORD  of hosts.
|  [2:11] The LORD  will terrify them;
|    he will reduce all the gods of the earth;
|  then all the peoples of the nations will worship him,
|    each in their own land.

|  [2:12] You, also, Ethiopians,
|    slain by his sword are you!
|  [2:13] And he will stretch out his hand
|    against the north and destroy Assyria;
|  And he will make Nineveh a desolation,
|    dry as the wilderness.
|  [2:14] Herds will lie down in it,
|    every beast of the earth,
|  Desert owl and screech owl
|    will lodge in its capitals.
|  The owl will hoot in the window,
|    the raven on the doorstep,
|    all stripped bare of cedar.

[2:15] This is the exultant city which sat secure. The city who said to herself, I am and there is none else! How has she become a desolation! A lair of beasts! Every passerby hisses at her, shakes their hand.

 [Zephaniah 3] 

##### Jerusalem’s Deep-seated Corruption #####

|  [3:1] Woe to the rebellious and unclean city of oppression,
|  [3:2] She has not obeyed the voice,
|    she has not accepted instruction,
|  In the LORD  she has not trusted,
|    to her God she has not drawn near.

|  [3:3] Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions.
|  Her judges are evening wolves,
|    who leave nothing over until the morning,
|  [3:4] Her prophets are braggarts, faithless men.
|  Her priests profane what is holy
|    and do violence to the law.

|  [3:5] The LORD  is righteous in her midst,
|    he does no wrong,
|  Morning by morning
|    he establishes his decree,
|  Light is not lacking,
|    an oversight is unknown.
|  But the unjust know no shame.

|  [3:6] “I have cut off nations,
|    their turrets are destroyed;
|  I have laid waste their broad streets,
|    so that none passes over them.
|  Desolate are their cities without people,
|    without inhabitants.”

|  [3:7] I said:
|  “Surely the city will fear me,
|    she will accept instruction.
|  Nothing will vanish from her eyes
|    that I have impressed upon her;
|  But the more zealously have they made all their deeds corrupt.”

##### The Future Vindication and Exultation of Jerusalem #####

[3:8] Wait for me, is the LORD ’s message, until the day when I stand up as a witness, for it is my fixed purpose to gather the nations, to collect the kingdoms, to pour upon them my wrath and my hot anger; for by the fire of my fury will all the earth be consumed.

[3:9] For then I will purify the lips of all peoples, so that they will all call on the LORD ’s name, to serve him with one accord.[3:10] From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers will bring me offerings.

[3:11] On that day you will no longer be ashamed of all your deeds by which you rebelled against me. For I will rid you of your proudly arrogant ones, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.[3:12] But I will leave in your midst a people humble and poor, and the remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD .[3:13] They will not do evil, nor speak falsehood, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth; but they will pasture and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.

|  [3:14] Cry out with joy, daughter of Zion,
|    shout aloud, Israel!
|  Rejoice and exult with all your heart,
|    daughter of Jerusalem.
|  [3:15] The LORD  has put away your adversaries,
|    he has turned away your foes;
|  the LORD  is king in your midst,
|    you will fear evil no more.
|  [3:16] In that day it will be said to Jerusalem:
|    Fear not!
|    Zion, let not your hands grow weak!
|  [3:17] The LORD  your God is in your midst,
|    a victorious hero.
|  He will rejoice over you with joy,
|    he will renew his love,
|  he will exult over you with singing,
|    [3:18] as on a day of festival.

|  I will take away from you your disgrace,
|    and put away from you your reproach.
|  [3:19] I will destroy at that time
|    all who afflict you.
|  I will deliver the lame,
|    and gather the outcast,
|  I will make them an object of renown
|    and fame in all the earth.
|  [3:20] I will do good to you,
|    at the time when I gather you.
|  For I will make you an object of fame and renown
|    among all the peoples of the earth;
|  when I bring back your captivity before your eyes.

|  This says the LORD .

Haggai
======

to the temple builders
----------------------

 [Haggai 1] 

##### The call to rebuild the Temple #####

[1:1] In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, this message from the LORD  came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest:

|  [1:2] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  The people say that the time has not yet come to rebuild the temple of the LORD .

[1:3] Then this message from the LORD  came to Haggai the prophet:

|  [1:4] Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your own well-roofed houses,
|  while this temple lies in ruins?

|  [1:5] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  Consider your past experiences.
|  [1:6] You sow much,
|    but bring in little;
|  you eat,
|    but you do not have enough;
|  you drink,
|    but are not filled;
|  you clothe yourselves,
|    but not enough to be warm;
|  and those who earn wages,
|    put those wages in a bag with holes.

|  [1:7] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  Consider your experiences.
|  [1:8] Go up to the mountains,
|    and bring wood
|    and rebuild the temple;
|  then I will be pleased with it,
|    and I will reveal my glory.

|  The LORD  says:
|  [1:9] You looked for much,
|    and it came to little;
|  and when you brought the harvest home,
|    I blew it away.
|  Why?

|  The LORD  of hosts says:
|  Because my temple lies in ruins,
|    while you shelter in your own houses.
|  [1:10] The heavens withhold the dew,
|    and the earth withholds its fruit,
|  [1:11] and I have called forth a drought upon the land
|    and upon the mountains,
|    and upon the grain and the new wine and the oil
|    and upon that which the ground brings forth,
|    and upon people and animals,
|    and upon all the labor of your hands.

[1:12] Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, with all the rest of the people, obeyed the command of the LORD  their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD  their God had sent him to them. They showed proper respect for the LORD .

[1:13] Haggai, the prophet of the LORD, as the LORD  commanded him, told the people: “The LORD  says: I am with you.”

[1:14] And the LORD  stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people, so that they came and worked on the temple of the LORD  of hosts, their God,[1:15] in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.

##### The future glory of the new Temple #####

In the second year of Darius the king,

 [Haggai 2] 

[2:1] on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, this message from the LORD  came to Haggai the prophet,[2:2] telling him to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the rest of the people:

|  [2:3] Who is left among you that saw this temple in its former glory?
|  And how do you see it now?
|  Doesn’t it seem as though there is nothing there?

|  [2:4] The LORD  says:
|  Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,
|    be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
|    be strong, all you people of the land.

|  The LORD  says:
|  Begin the work, for I am with you.

|  The LORD  of hosts says:
|  [2:5] When your ancestors left Egypt I made a promise to you,
|    and I am still with you.
|  Do not be afraid!

|  [2:6] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  In a little while, I will shake the heavens,
|    and the earth, and the sea, and the land.
|  [2:7] And I will shake all nations,
|    and the precious things of all nations shall come here;
|    and I will fill this temple with glory.

|  The LORD  of hosts says:
|  [2:8] The silver is mine,
|    and the gold is mine,
|  [2:9] The later glory of this temple
|    shall be greater than the former.

|  The LORD  of hosts says:
|  In this place I will grant prosperity.

This is the message of the LORD  of hosts.

##### Former displeasure and the new promise of blessings #####

[2:10] In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, this message from the LORD  came to Haggai the prophet:[2:11] The LORD  of hosts says: “Ask the priests for a ruling:[2:12] ‘If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with that garment touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy?’”

And the priests answered: “No.”

[2:13] Then said Haggai, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?”

And the priests answered: “It would be unclean.”

[2:14] Haggai replied: “So is this people and so is this nation before me, the LORD  declares, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.[2:15] Think back from this day, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD .[2:16] How were you? When you came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, there were only ten; when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were only twenty.[2:17] ‘I struck all the work of your hands with blasting and blight, with mildew and with hail. Yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says the LORD,[2:18] ‘Think back from this day, think! From the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day when the foundations of the temple of the LORD  were laid, and consider.[2:19] The seed is in the granary, but the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree have not yet brought forth fruit. From this day will I bless you.’”

##### Zerubbabel #####

[2:20] This message from the LORD  came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:

|  [2:21] Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah:
|  I will shake the heavens and the earth;
|    [2:22] and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms;
|    and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations;
|    and I will overthrow the chariots,
|    and those who ride in them;
|    and the horses and their riders shall come down,
|    each by the sword of his fellow.

|  [2:23] In that day,
|    the LORD  of hosts says,
|  I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,
|    the LORD  says,
|  and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,
|    the LORD  of hosts says.


Zechariah
=========

 [Zechariah 1] 

##### The Lesson from the Past #####

[1:1] In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of the LORD  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo:

[1:2] The LORD  was furious with your ancestors.[1:3] So tell the people this message of the LORD  of hosts: “Return to me,” says the LORD  of hosts, “and I will return to you” says the LORD  of hosts.[1:4] “Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, ‘The LORD  of hosts says to turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds’. They did not heed nor listen to me,” says the LORD .[1:5] “Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?[1:6] But did not my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD  of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our deeds, so he has dealt with us.’”

##### The Lord’s Jealous Love for Zion #####

[1:7] In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the LORD  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo:

[1:8] I saw in the night a man on a red horse, among the myrtle trees that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.[1:9] Then said I, “My Lord, what are these?” And the messenger who was talking with me said, “I will show you what they are.”[1:10] And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the LORD  has sent to patrol the earth.”[1:11] And the riders answered the messenger of the LORD  who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the earth is still and at peace.”

[1:12] Then the messenger of the LORD  said, “LORD  of hosts, how long will you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you have been angry for seventy years?”[1:13] And the LORD  answered the messenger who was talking with me with kind and comforting words.[1:14] So the messenger who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim now that the LORD  of hosts says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem.[1:15] But I am deeply angry with the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel but they made the suffering worse.[1:16] Therefore, says the LORD, I am turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it, says the LORD  of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.[1:17] Proclaim again: Thus says the LORD  of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity and the LORD  will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.”

##### Destruction of the Heathen Powers #####

[1:18] Now I looked up and saw four horns.[1:19] I said to the messenger who was talking with me, “What are these?” He answered, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”

[1:20] Then the LORD  showed me four smiths.[1:21] I said, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared lift their head. But the smiths have come to terrify them, to crush the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”

 [Zechariah 2] 

##### Promise that Jerusalem Will be Gloriously Restored #####

[2:1] Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.[2:2] I said, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and length.”[2:3] Then the messenger who talked with me stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him,[2:4] and said to him, “Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will live there.[2:5] For I, says the LORD, will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.

|  [2:6] Up! Away! Flee from the land of the north, says the LORD .
|  For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says the LORD .
|  [2:7] Up, escape to Zion, you who live in Babylon.
|  [2:8] This is what the LORD  of hosts says to the nations which plundered you:
|  Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye.
|  [2:9] I will raise my hand against them.
|  They will be plunder for their own slaves; and you will know that the LORD  of hosts has sent me.

|  [2:10] “Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! I am coming,
|  I will live among you, says the LORD .
|  [2:11] Many nations will join themselves to the LORD  in that day,
|  and will be his people, and he will live among you.
|  You will know that the LORD  of hosts has sent me to you.
|  [2:12] The LORD  will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land.
|  He will again choose Jerusalem.
|  [2:13] Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the LORD,
|  because he is coming from his holy dwelling.”

 [Zechariah 3] 

##### Purification of the Priesthood and Nation #####

[3:1] Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the LORD  and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him.[3:2] And the messenger of the LORD  said to the Adversary, “May the LORD  rebuke you, Adversary! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?”[3:3] Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger.[3:4] The messenger said to those who stood before him, “Take off his filthy garments.” Then to Joshua he said, “I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.”[3:5] And he ordered: “Set a clean turban upon his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the LORD  was standing by.

[3:6] And the messenger of the LORD  testified to Joshua:[3:7] The LORD  of hosts says: “If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access among these that stand by.[3:8] Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch.[3:9] On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,” says the LORD  of hosts, “and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day.[3:10] On that day,” says the LORD  of hosts, “you will each invite your neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.”

 [Zechariah 4] 

##### The Supporters of the Temple Service #####

[4:1] Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as someone who is woken from sleep.[4:2] He said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on its top,[4:3] and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on its left side.”[4:4] I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”[4:5] Then the messenger who talked with me answered, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said. “No, my lord.”[4:6] He said to me, “This is the message of the LORD  regarding Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the LORD  of hosts,[4:7] will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, ‘Grace, grace, to it.’”[4:8] Moreover this message of the LORD  came to me:[4:9] The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the LORD  of hosts has sent me to you.[4:10] For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are the eyes of the LORD  that search all around the world.)[4:11] Again I asked, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on its left side?”[4:12] Again, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?”[4:13] He answered me, “Don’t you now what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”[4:14] Then he explained, “They are the two anointed ones who attend the Lord of all the earth.”

 [Zechariah 5] 

##### The Flying Scroll #####

[5:1] Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll.[5:2] He said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.”[5:3] Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath shall be banished according to the writing on the other side.[5:4] I have sent it out, says the LORD  of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.”

##### The Woman in an Ephah #####

[5:5] Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Look up and see what is now coming.”[5:6] I said. “What is it?” He said, “It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.”[5:7] A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket.[5:8] He said, “This is Wickedness.” He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth.[5:9] Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them.[5:10] Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”[5:11] He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.”

 [Zechariah 6] 

##### The War-Chariots of the Lord #####

[6:1] Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze.[6:2] The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses,[6:3] the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses.[6:4] Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”[6:5] The messenger answered me, “These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the LORD  of all the earth.[6:6] The black horses are going toward the north country and the white toward the west and the dappled toward the south country.”[6:7] The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, “Go, patrol the earth,” and they did so.[6:8] Then he cried out to me, “The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.”

##### Preparations for the Crowning of Zerubbabel #####

[6:9] Now this message of the LORD  came to me:[6:10] Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah.[6:11] Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.

[6:12] Tell him: “Thus says the LORD  of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the LORD .[6:13] He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honor due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony.[6:14] The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the LORD  for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah.[6:15] People from far away will come and build in the temple of the LORD  and you will know that the LORD  of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD  your God.”

 [Zechariah 7] 

##### The Lord’s Real Demands #####

[7:1] In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the LORD  came to Zechariah.[7:2] The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favor of the LORD,[7:3] and to ask the priests of the house of the LORD  of hosts, and the prophets “Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?”[7:4] Then this message of the LORD  of hosts came to me:[7:5] Tell all the people of the land and the priests, “When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?[7:6] When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?[7:7] Wasn’t it this which the LORD  proclaimed by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?”

[7:8] The LORD  gave this message to Zechariah:[7:9] The LORD  of hosts says, execute true judgments. Show kindness and mercy to each other.[7:10] Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident alien or the poor. Let none of you devise evil against another in your hearts.

[7:11] But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears so they wouldn’t hear.[7:12] They made their hearts as hard as stone so they wouldn’t accept the teaching and the words that the LORD  of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great was the anger of the LORD  of hosts:[7:13] I called and they would not hear, so they call and I do not hear, says the LORD  of hosts.[7:14] I scattered them by a whirlwind out among nations unknown to them. The land was left desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made the pleasant land a desolation.

 [Zechariah 8] 

##### Promises that the Scattered Exiles Will Return and the Lord’s Rule be Widely Acknowledged #####

[8:1] Now this message of the LORD  of hosts came to me:

|  [8:2] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  I passionately care for Zion,
|  and I am fiercely protective of her.
|  [8:3] The LORD  says, I have returned to Zion,
|  and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem
|  and Jerusalem will be called, ‘The City of Truth’
|  and the mountain of the LORD  of hosts, ‘The Holy Mountain.’
|  [8:4] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  Old men and old women will sit again in the squares of Jerusalem,
|  each leaning on a staff because of old age.
|  [8:5] And the streets of the city will be full of boys,
|  and of girls playing in its squares.

|  [8:6] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  Just because it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in these days,
|  is it also impossible for me? says the LORD  of hosts.
|  [8:7] The LORD  of hosts says:
|  I will rescue my people
|  from the land of the east and the land of the west.
|  [8:8] I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem,
|  and they will be my people,
|  and I will be their God,
|  in truth and righteousness.

[8:9] The LORD  of hosts says: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days the words of the prophets spoken when the foundations for the house of the LORD  of hosts were laid.[8:10] For before those days there were no wages for people or animals. No one could go out or return safe from enemies, because I set each against their neighbor.[8:11] But now I will treat the remnant of the people differently from former days, says the LORD  of hosts.

|  [8:12] Peace will be sown.
|  The vine will bear its fruit and the ground will yield its produce,
|  and the skies will give their dew.
|  I will give the remnant of this people all these things.
|  [8:13] Just as you were accursed among the nations,
|  house of Judah and house of Israel,
|  so I will save you and you will be a blessing.
|  Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.

[8:14] For the LORD  of hosts says: As I planned to do evil to you when your ancestors provoked me to anger, says the LORD  of hosts, and I did not relent,[8:15] so again have I planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.

[8:16] These are the things that you should do: Speak the truth to each other. Render peaceful decisions in your gates.[8:17] Let none of you devise evil in your heart against one another. Do not love perjury. All these are things I hate, says the LORD .

[8:18] And this message of the LORD  of hosts came to me:[8:19] The LORD  of hosts says: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be festivals of joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.

[8:20] The LORD  of hosts says: Peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will come,[8:21] and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, “Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD  of hosts; I will go also.”[8:22] Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD  of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the LORD .[8:23] The LORD  of hosts says: In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, “We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”

 [Zechariah 9] 

##### The Conquest of Israel’s Foes #####

|  [9:1] An oracle:
|  The message of the LORD  concerns the land of Hadrach,
|  it rests upon Damascus.
|  For the capital of Aram belongs to the LORD,
|  as the tribes of Israel do,
|  [9:2] and also Hamath which borders on it.
|  Tyre and Sidon, for all their wisdom.
|  [9:3] Tyre built for herself a fortress.
|  Heaped up silver as dust,
|  and gold like the dirt of the streets.
|  [9:4] But now the Lord will dispossess her,
|  cast down her rampart into the sea.
|  She will be consumed in fire.

|  [9:5] Ashkelon will see and fear,
|  and Gaza writhe in anguish,
|  Ekron, also for her hope will be put to shame.
|  The king will perish from Gaza,
|  Ashkelon will remain uninhabited.
|  [9:6] A foreign people will settle in Ashdod,
|  and I will humble the pride of the Philistines.
|  [9:7] I will take their blood from their mouth,
|  and their abominations from between their teeth.
|  They also will be a remnant for our God,
|  like a clan in Judah,
|  and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.

|  [9:8] But I will encamp as a guard about my house,
|  so that none will pass through or return,
|  and no oppressor will pass through them again,
|  for now I have seen with my own eyes.

|  [9:9] Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!
|  Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem!
|  Look, your king comes to you.
|  Vindicated and victorious is he,
|  humble, and riding on a donkey,
|  on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

|  [9:10] He will cut off chariots from Ephraim,
|  and war horses from Jerusalem.
|  The battle bow will be cut off,
|  and he will speak peace to the nations.
|  His rule will be from sea to sea,
|  from the river to the ends of the earth.

|  [9:11] And you, too – because of your blood covenant,
|  I have set free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
|  [9:12] To the stronghold will the prisoners of hope return.
|  This day I declare, I will restore double to you.

|  [9:13] For I have bent Judah to me,
|  like a bow which I have filled with Ephraim like an arrow.
|  I will urge your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece,
|  I will make you like the sword of a hero.
|  [9:14] Then the LORD  will be seen above them
|  and his arrow will go forth like lightning.
|  The LORD  will blow a blast upon a trumpet,
|  and travel on the whirlwinds of the south.
|  [9:15] The LORD  of hosts will defend them.
|  They will devour and tread down the slingstones,
|  they will drink their blood like wine,
|  they will be full like a bowl,
|  like the crevices of the altar.

|  [9:16] And the LORD  their God will save them on that day,
|  as the flock of his people,
|  as the jewel of a crown
|  shining in his land.
|  [9:17] How good and how beautiful will it be!
|  Corn will make the young men flourish
|  and new wine the young women!

 [Zechariah 10] 

##### Victory and Restoration for the Lord’s Betrayed but Loyal People #####

|  [10:1] Ask from the LORD  rain,
|  at the time of spring rain,
|  from the LORD  who forms the storm clouds,
|  and the showers of rain he gives to you,
|  and green in the field.
|  [10:2] But the household gods speak nonsense,
|  and the diviners see lies,
|  and relate idle dreams.
|  In vain they offer comfort,
|  so the people wander like sheep,
|  They suffer because there is no shepherd.
|  [10:3] My wrath is hot against the shepherds,
|  and on the leaders will I bring punishment.
|  For the LORD  cares for his flock,
|  the house of Judah,
|  and will make them his splendid war steeds.

|  [10:4] From Judah will come the cornerstone and the stay,
|  from them the battle bow,
|  from them goes forth every commander.
|  [10:5] Together they will trample on warriors,
|  as on the dirt of the streets in battle.
|  They fight, for the LORD  is with them,
|  putting the riders on horses to shame.

|  [10:6] I will make strong the house of Judah,
|  I will bring deliverance to the house of Joseph,
|  I will bring them back for I have compassion on them,
|  they will be as if I had not driven them away
|  For I am the LORD  their God and will answer them.
|  [10:7] The Ephraimites will be like warriors,
|  their hearts will rejoice as with wine,
|  their children will see and rejoice.
|  Their hearts will exult in the LORD .

|  [10:8] I will whistle for them, and gather them,
|  and they will be as many as they once were.
|  [10:9] I will sow them among the peoples,
|  but in distant lands they will remember me,
|  and they will bring up their children and come back.
|  [10:10] I will bring them home from the land of Egypt,
|  and from Assyria will I gather them.
|  Into the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them,
|  until the land overflows with them.
|  [10:11] And when they pass through the sea of distress,
|  I will strike down the waves of the sea,
|  and all the deeps of the Nile will be dried up.
|  The pride of Assyria will be brought low
|  and the sceptre of Egypt turned aside.

|  [10:12] I will make them strong in the LORD,
|  they will walk in his name,
|    says the LORD .

 [Zechariah 11] 

##### Fate of Judah’s Traitorous Rulers and the Ultimate Deliverance #####

|  [11:1] Open your doors, Lebanon,
|  so that fire may devour your cedars.
|  [11:2] Wail, pine-tree, for the cedar is fallen.
|  Wail, oaks of Bashan,
|  for the inaccessible forest has fallen.
|  [11:3] Listen to the wailing of the shepherds!
|  Their glory is destroyed.
|  Listen to the roaring of young lions!
|  Blasted is the thick forest of the Jordan.

[11:4] The LORD  said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter,[11:5] whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The people who sell them say, Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich! And their own shepherds have no compassion for them.[11:6] I will no longer have pity on the people of this earth, says the LORD . I will turn neighbor against neighbor, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land is devastated I will not rescue them.[11:7] So I shepherded the flock of slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep.[11:8] I set aside three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them, and they also were displeased at me.[11:9] I said, I will not shepherd you. What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And let those who are left devour one another’s flesh.[11:10] And I took my staff, Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

[11:11] In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me knew that it was the LORD ’s message.[11:12] And I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don’t.” So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver.[11:13] And the LORD  said to me, Cast it into the treasury – the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the LORD, into the treasury.

[11:14] Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem.[11:15] And the LORD  said to me: Take again the implements of a worthless shepherd.[11:16] For I am about to appoint a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit. Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will devour and even their hoofs he will tear.

|  [11:17] Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock!
|  May the sword strike his arm and his right eye.
|  May his arm completely wither.
|  And his right eye be blinded.

 [Zechariah 12] 

##### Jerusalem’s Deliverance from Heathen Attack #####

[12:1] An oracle. This is the message of the LORD  about Israel. The LORD  who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the human spirit within people says:

|  [12:2] Look! I am about to make Jerusalem
|  a cup of drunkenness for all the surrounding peoples.
|  There will be a siege of Jerusalem.
|  [12:3] On that day that I will make Jerusalem
|  a stone to be lifted up by all the peoples.
|  All who lift it up will surely hurt themselves!
|  And all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it.

|  [12:4] On that day, says the LORD, I will strike
|  every horse with panic and its rider with madness.
|  But over the house of Judah I will keep watch,
|  though I strike every horse belonging to the peoples with blindness.
|  [12:5] And the chieftains of Judah will say to themselves,
|  “The strength of the inhabitants is in the LORD  of hosts their God.”

|  [12:6] In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah
|  like a pan of fire in the woods,
|  like a torch among sheaves,
|  they will devour right and left all the surrounding peoples.
|  But Jerusalem will abide on its own site.
|  [12:7] And the LORD  will first give victory to the tents of Judah,
|  so that the glory of the house of David, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not exalted above Judah.

|  [12:8] In that day the LORD  will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
|  and the feeblest among them will in that day be like David,
|  and the house of David like God, like the messenger of the LORD  before them.
|  [12:9] And in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations who have come up against Jerusalem.

|  [12:10] And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
|  the spirit of pity and compassion. They will look on him whom they have pierced
|  and they will lament for him as one laments for an only son.
|  They will bitterly grieve for him as one grieves for the first-born.
|  [12:11] In that day mourning will be as great in Jerusalem
|  as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
|  [12:12] And the land will mourn, each family by itself:
|  the family of the house of David by itself,
|  and their wives by themselves,
|  and the family of the house of Nathan by itself,
|  and their wives by themselves,
|  [12:13] and the family of the house of Levi by itself,
|  and their wives by themselves,
|  the family of the Shimeites by itself,
|  and their wives by themselves,
|  [12:14] and all the families who are left, each by itself,
|  and their wives by themselves.

 [Zechariah 13] 

|  [13:1] On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David,
|  and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
|  [13:2] And it will be on that day, says the LORD  of hosts,
|  I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will be remembered no more.
|  And the prophets and the unclean spirit I will banish from the land.

|  [13:3] If any man prophesy any more,
|  his father and his mother who bore him, will say to him,
|  “You will not live, for you speak falsehood in the name of the LORD .”
|  And his father and his mother who bore him will stab him through when he is seized by the prophetic frenzy.
|  [13:4] And it will be in that day that the prophets will be ashamed, each of his vision,
|  and will not wear the hairy mantle in order to deceive.
|  [13:5] Each will say, “I am not a prophet,
|  a tiller of the ground am I, for the ground is my possession from my youth.”
|  [13:6] And they will say to him, “What are these scars on your back?”
|  And he will say, “The scars which I received in the house of my friends.”

|  [13:7] Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
|  against the man who stands near to me,
|  says the LORD  of hosts.
|  I will strike the shepherd so that the sheep may be scattered,
|  I will turn my hand against the little ones.
|  [13:8] In all the land, says the LORD,
|  two-thirds in it will be cut off and die,
|  but a third will be left in it.
|  [13:9] I will bring the third into the fire,
|  and melt it as one melts silver,
|  and test it as one tests gold.
|  Then they will call on my name,
|  and I myself will answer them.
|  I will say, “They are my people.”
|  They will say, “The LORD  is our God.”

 [Zechariah 14] 

##### The Judgment upon the Heathen and the Exaltation of the Lord #####

[14:1] A day is coming for the LORD, when your plundered possessions will be divided while you watch.[14:2] And all the nations will gather to Jerusalem, to fight against it. The city will be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go into captivity, and the rest of the people left in the ruins.[14:3] Then the LORD  will go forth and fight against these nations, as once he fought in the day of battle.[14:4] On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, (which is opposite Jerusalem, on the east). The Mount of Olives will be split into halves, from east to west, by an exceedingly great valley; and half of the mountain will slide northwards and half southwards.[14:5] You will escape through my valley – the valley between the hills will extend as far as Azel, and you will flee as you fled from before the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. But the LORD  your God will come, and all the holy ones with him.

[14:6] And in that day, there will be no heat nor cold nor frost,[14:7] but it will be constant day – it is known to the LORD  – with neither day nor night. Even at evening time there will be light.[14:8] And on that day living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; in both summer and winter.[14:9] The LORD  will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD  will be one, and his name one.[14:10] The land will be changed to plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem will be high and inhabited as it stands, from the Benjamin Gate up to the place of the first gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate, and as far as the king’s winepresses.[14:11] Jerusalem will be inhabited, for never again will it be doomed to destruction, and its people will abide in security.

[14:12] This is the plague with which the LORD  will strike all the peoples who array themselves against Jerusalem: he will make their flesh rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouth.[14:13] On that day a great panic sent by the Lord will fall on them. Everyone will seize their neighbours and attack them.[14:14] Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up – gold and silver and piles of clothing.[14:15] Plague will fall upon the horses, mules, camels, and asses, and on all the animals in all those camps.

[14:16] All who are left of all the nations which fought against Jerusalem will come up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD  of hosts, and to keep the pilgrim-feast of tabernacles.[14:17] Whoever of all the peoples of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD  of hosts, on them there will be no rain.[14:18] If the family of Egypt does not go up nor enter in, on them also will come the plague with which the LORD  will strike the nations.[14:19] This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all nations which do not come up to keep the feast of the tabernacles.

[14:20] On that day there will be inscribed upon the bells of the horses, ‘Holy to the LORD ’ and the pots in the house of the LORD  will be as holy as the sacrificial bowls before the altars.[14:21] Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD  of hosts and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and cook the sacrifices in them. There will be no more traffickers in the house of the LORD  of hosts in that day.


Malachi

 [Malachi 1] 

##### The Lord’s Love for Israel #####

[1:1] An oracle. The message of the LORD  to Israel through Malachi.

[1:2] “I have loved you,” says the LORD . “But you ask, ‘How have you shown love to us?’ Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” explains the LORD  of hosts, “yet I loved Jacob,[1:3] but hated Esau, and made his mountains a desolation, and transformed his ancestral land into a wilderness.[1:4] When Edom says, ‘We are beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the ruined places’” the LORD  of hosts says, “They may build, but I will throw down. They will be called, ‘The border land of wickedness,’ the people against whom the LORD  is angry forever.[1:5] Your own eyes will see this, and you will say, ‘the LORD ’s greatness reaches beyond the border of Israel.’”[1:6] 

##### Against the Priests #####

“A son honors his father and servant their master. If I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the one who fears me? So says the LORD  to you, priests who despise my name. You ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’[1:7] You offer on my altar bread that is polluted. You ask, ‘How have we polluted it?’ Because you say, ‘The table of the LORD  is contemptible.’[1:8] When you offer the blind animal for sacrifice, ‘It doesn’t matter!’ And when you offer the lame and the sick ‘It doesn’t matter!’ Give an animal like that to your governor; will he be pleased with it? Will he receive you favorably?” says the LORD  of hosts.[1:9] Now, plead for the favor of God with such an offering, so that he may be gracious to us. “Would I receive any of you favorably?” says the LORD  of hosts.

[1:10] “If only one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you could not kindle useless fires on my altar! I have no pleasure in you,” says the LORD  of hosts, “Nor will I accept an offering from your hand.[1:11] For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place they offer to my name a pure offering. For my name is great among the nations,” says the LORD  of hosts.

[1:12] “But you profane me when you say, ‘The table of the LORD  is polluted, and its food is contemptible.’[1:13] You say also, ‘How tired we are of all this!’ and you sniff contemptuously at it. You have brought the blind, the lame and the sick as offerings. Should I accept this from your hand?” says the LORD  of hosts.[1:14] “Cursed be the cheat, who has in his flock a valuable male, but vows and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished animal! For I am a great king,” says the LORD  of hosts, “and my name is feared among the nations.”

 [Malachi 2] 

[2:1] “Now, you priests, this command is for you.[2:2] If you will not hear, and if you do not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says the LORD  of hosts, “Then I will lay a curse on you. I will turn your blessings into curses. Indeed I have already done so, because you pay no attention.[2:3] I will punish your descendants! I will spread offal upon your faces, even the offal of your pilgrim feasts, you will be discarded.[2:4] You will then know that I have sent this command to you, so that my covenant with Levi may be preserved,” says the LORD  of hosts.

[2:5] “My covenant with him was to give life and peace. I gave them to him so that he might revere me. He revered me, and stood in awe of my name.[2:6] The true instruction was in his mouth, and injustice was not found in his lips; He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.[2:7] For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD  of hosts.

[2:8] “But you have turned aside from that way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says the LORD  of hosts.[2:9] “So I have I made you contemptible and degraded before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had no respect for me in imparting the law.”[2:10] 

##### Unfaithfulness #####

Don’t we have all one father? Didn’t one God created us? Why do we deal faithlessly with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?[2:11] Judah is treacherous, and abominations are committed in Israel and in Jerusalem because Judah has profaned the holy things loved by the LORD, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.[2:12] May the LORD  banish from the community of Jacob anyone who does this, anyone awaking, testifying, and making an offering to the LORD  of hosts.[2:13] And you also do this: You cover the altar of the LORD  with tears, because he doesn’t accept the offering any more, doesn’t accept it from your hand.[2:14] Yet you ask, “Why?” Because the LORD  is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young. You have been unfaithful to her, even though she is your companion, and your legal wife.

[2:15] Did not the one God make everyone, so that all both flesh and spirit is his? And what does that one God seek but godly children? Therefore keep watch over your spirit, and let none of you deal faithlessly with the wife of your youth.[2:16] “A man who divorces or puts away his wife,” says LORD, the God of Israel, “overwhelms her with cruelty.” The LORD  of hosts says: “Keep watch over your spirit, do not be unfaithful.”

##### The Lord’s Coming Judgment #####

[2:17] You have wearied the LORD  with your words. You ask, “How have we wearied him?” By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them.” Or, “Where is the God of justice?”

 [Malachi 3] 

[3:1] “I am about to send my messenger and he will clear a path before me: And the LORD, who you are seeking, will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant who you long for is already coming, says the LORD  of hosts.[3:2] But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand firm when he appears? He is like a refiner’s fire, and like a launderer’s soap,[3:3] and he will sit as a refiner and purifier. He will purify the descendants of Levi, and refine them like gold and silver, until they are fit to bring offerings to the LORD .[3:4] Then will the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

[3:5] “I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against the sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who cheat workers, or widows, or orphans, deny justice to immigrants, and do not fear me,” says the LORD  of hosts.[3:6] “For I, the LORD, do not change; and you have not ceased to be descendants of Jacob.”

##### Paying the Tithe #####

[3:7] “From the days of your ancestors, you have turned aside from my statutes, and you have not kept them. Turn to me and I will turn to you,” says the LORD . “You say, ‘How should we turn?’[3:8] Can a human rob God? Yet you robbed me. You ask, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and gifts![3:9] You – your entire nation – are all cursed, because you rob me.

[3:10] “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there is food in my house. Test me in this way. See if I will not open to you the windows of the sky, and pour you out a blessing, until there is more than enough.[3:11] I will rebuke for your sakes the devouring locust and he will not destroy your crops, nor will the vine fail to ripen its fruit in the field, says the LORD  of hosts,[3:12] and all nations will call you happy, for you will be a delightful land,” says the LORD  of hosts.[3:13] 

##### Future Reward of the Godless and Faithful #####

“You have said terrible things about me,” says the LORD . “You ask, ‘What have we said about you?’[3:14] You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God, and what do we gain from the LORD  of hosts by keeping his commands, and walking mournfully in funeral garb before him?[3:15] So now we call the proud happy, evildoers thrive: they dare God and escape unharmed.’”

[3:16] Such things those who revered the LORD  spoke to one another, and the LORD  took notice, and a record was written before him of those who revered the LORD  and those who keep in mind his name.[3:17] “They will be mine,” says the LORD  of hosts, “my special possession on that day that I am preparing. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.[3:18] Once again my people will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the person who serves God and the person who does not.”

 [Malachi 4] 

[4:1] “The day is coming that will burn like a furnace, and all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble, and the day that is coming will burn them up,” says the LORD  of hosts, “leaving neither root nor branch.[4:2] But to you who revere my name there will arise the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings, and you will run free like calves let out from their stall.[4:3] In the day when I act you will tread down the wicked, they will be as ashes under the soles of your feet,” says the LORD  of hosts.

[4:4] “Remember the law of Moses my servant, statutes and judgments which I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.[4:5] I am about to send to you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of the LORD  comes.[4:6] He will turn fathers’ hearts to their sons and sons’ hearts to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgement.”

Matthew

 [Matthew 1] 

##### The Birth, Parentage and Infancy #####

[1:1] A genealogy of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and Abraham.[1:2] Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his brothers,[1:3] Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez of Hezron, Hezron of Aram,[1:4] Aram of Aminadab, Aminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,[1:5] Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed of Jesse,[1:6] Jesse of David the King. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah’s widow,[1:7] Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa,[1:8] Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of Joram, Joram of Uzziah,[1:9] Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of Hezekiah,[1:10] Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah,[1:11] Josiah of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon.[1:12] After the Exile to Babylon – Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, Salathiel of Zerubbabel,[1:13] Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor,[1:14] Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim, Achim of Eliud,[1:15] Eliud of Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan, Matthan of Jacob,[1:16] Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called ‘Christ’.[1:17] So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen.

[1:18] This is how Jesus Christ was born:

His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.[1:19] Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately.[1:20] He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.

“Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.[1:21] She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”

[1:22] All this happened in fulfillment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says –

|  [1:23] ‘The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel’

– a word which means ‘God is with us.’[1:24] When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him.[1:25] He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus.

 [Matthew 2] 


[2:1] After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking,[2:2] “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”[2:3] When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem.[2:4] He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born.

[2:5] “At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer, “for it is said in the prophet –

|  [2:6] ‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land,
|    are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah,
|  for out of you will come a ruler –
|    who will shepherd my people Israel.’”

[2:7] Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star.[2:8] Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.”[2:9] The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was.[2:10] At the sight of the star they were filled with joy.[2:11] Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.[2:12] But afterward, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road.

[2:13] After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.”[2:14] Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt,[2:15] and there he stayed until Herod’s death; in fulfillment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says –

|  ‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’

[2:16] When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers.[2:17] Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says –

|  [2:18] ‘A voice was heard in Ramah,
|    weeping and mourning loudly;
|  Rachel, weeping for her children,
|    refusing all comfort for they were dead.’

[2:19] But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,[2:20] “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.”[2:21] He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel.[2:22] But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee.[2:23] There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfillment of these words in the prophets – ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’

 [Matthew 3] 

##### The Preparation #####

[3:1] About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:[3:2] “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”[3:3] John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says –

|  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
|  “Make ready the way of the Lord,
|  make his paths straight.”’

[3:4] John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.[3:5] At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him[3:6] and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

[3:7] But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?[3:8] Let your life, then, prove your repentance;[3:9] and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham![3:10] Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.[3:11] I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.[3:12] His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”

[3:13] Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.[3:14] But John tried to prevent him.

“I need to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?”

[3:15]  “This is the way it should be for now,”  Jesus answered,  “because we should do everything that God requires.”  So John agreed.

[3:16] After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,[3:17] and from the heavens there came a voice which said, “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.”

 [Matthew 4] 


[4:1] Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.[4:2] And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.[4:3] The Tempter came to him, and said:

|  “If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”

[4:4] But Jesus answered,  “Scripture says –

|  ‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” 

[4:5] Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him,[4:6] “If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says –

|  ‘He will give his angels commands about you,
|  and on their hands they will lift you up,
|  so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.’”

[4:7]  “Scripture also says,”  answered Jesus,

|   “‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” 

[4:8] The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, said to him:

|  [4:9] “All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.”

[4:10] Then Jesus said to him,  “Go away, Satan! For scripture says –

|  ‘You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” 

[4:11] Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him.

##### The Work in Galilee #####

[4:12] When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.[4:13] Afterward, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;[4:14] in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah –

|  [4:15] ‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
|  the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan,
|    with Galilee of the Gentiles –
|  [4:16] The people who were living in darkness
|    have seen a great light,
|  and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death,
|    a light has dawned!’

[4:17] At that time Jesus began to proclaim –

|   “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” 

[4:18] As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers – Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew – casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

[4:19]  “Come and follow me,”  Jesus said,  “and I will teach you to fish for people.” [4:20] The two men left their nets at once and followed him.[4:21] Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them,[4:22] and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him.

[4:23] Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people;[4:24] and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain – any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralyzed; and he cured them.[4:25] He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

 [Matthew 5] 

[5:1] On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him;[5:2] and he began to teach them, saying:

|  [5:3]  “Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
|     for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
|  [5:4]  Blessed are the mourners, 
|     for they will be comforted. 
|  [5:5]  Blessed are the gentle, 
|     for they will inherit the earth. 
|  [5:6]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, 
|     for they will be satisfied. 
|  [5:7]  Blessed are the merciful, 
|     for they will find mercy. 
|  [5:8]  Blessed are the pure in heart, 
|     for they will see God. 
|  [5:9]  Blessed are the peacemakers, 
|     for they will be called children of God. 
|  [5:10]  Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, 
|     for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

[5:11]  “Blessed are you when people insult you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me. [5:12]  Be glad and rejoice, because your reward in heaven will be great; this is the way they persecuted the prophets who lived before you. 

[5:13]  “You are salt for the world. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown away, and trampled underfoot. [5:14]  It is you who are the light of the world. A town that stands on a hill cannot be hidden. [5:15]  People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp-stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house. [5:16]  Let your light so shine before the eyes of others so that, seeing your good actions, they will praise your Father who is in heaven. 

[5:17]  “Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them. [5:18]  For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the Law until all is done. [5:19]  Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments, even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least esteemed in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches others to do so, will be esteemed great in the kingdom of heaven. [5:20]  Indeed I tell you that, unless you obey God’s commands better than of the teachers of the Law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

[5:21]  “You have heard that to our ancestors it was said – ‘You must not commit murder,’ and ‘Whoever commits murder will be brought to trial.’ [5:22]  But I say to you that anyone who is angry at their brother or sister will be brought to trial; and whoever insults their brother or sister will be brought before the High Council, while whoever calls them a fool will be in danger of the fires of Gehenna. [5:23]  Therefore, when presenting your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, [5:24]  leave your gift there, before the altar, go and be reconciled to them, first, then come and present your gift. [5:25]  Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet them on your way to the court; otherwise they might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the judicial officer, and you will be thrown into prison. [5:26]  I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the last cent. 

[5:27]  “You have heard that it was said – ‘You must not commit adultery.’ [5:28]  But I say to you that anyone who looks at a woman and desires her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [5:29]  If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it thrown into Gehenna. [5:30]  And, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it go down to Gehenna. 

[5:31]  “It was also said – ‘Let anyone who divorces his wife serve her with a notice of separation.’ [5:32]  But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, leads to her committing adultery; while anyone who marries her after her divorce is guilty of adultery. [5:33]  Again, you have heard that our ancestors were told – ‘Do not break your oaths, keep your vows to the Lord.’ [5:34]  But I say to you that you must not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God’s throne, [5:35]  or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King. [5:36]  Nor should you swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or black. [5:37]  Let your words be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from what is evil. 

[5:38]  “You have heard that it was said – ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ [5:39]  But I say to you that you must not resist those who wrong you; but, if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to them also. [5:40]  If someone sues you for your shirt, let them have your cloak as well. [5:41]  If you are forced to carry a soldier’s pack for one mile, carry it two. [5:42]  Give to anyone who asks and, if someone wants to borrow from you, do not turn them away. 

[5:43]  You have heard that it was said – ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ [5:44]  But what I tell you is this: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, [5:45]  so that you may become children of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and good alike, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. [5:46]  For, if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax-gatherers do this! [5:47]  And, if you only welcome your brothers and sisters, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this! [5:48]  You, then, must become perfect – as your heavenly Father is perfect. 

 [Matthew 6] 

[6:1]  “Take care not to perform your religious duties in public in order to be seen by others; if you do, your Father who is in heaven has no reward for you. [6:2]  Therefore, when you do acts of charity, do not have a trumpet blown in front of you, as hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. There, I tell you, is their reward! [6:3]  But, when you do acts of charity, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, [6:4]  so that your charity may be secret; and your Father, who sees what is in secret, will reward you. 

[6:5]  “And, when you pray, you are not to behave as hypocrites do. They like to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, so that people will see them. There, I tell you, is their reward! [6:6]  But, when one of you prays, they should go into their own room, shut the door, and pray to their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them. [6:7]  When praying, do not repeat the same words over and over again, as is done by the Gentiles, who think that by using many words they will obtain a hearing. [6:8]  Do not imitate them; for God, your Father, knows what you need before you ask him. [6:9]  You, therefore, should pray like this – 

|   ‘Our Father, who is in heaven, 
|   may your name be held holy, 
|  [6:10]  your kingdom come, your will be done – 
|     on earth, as in heaven. 
|  [6:11]  Give us today 
|     the bread that we will need; 
|  [6:12]  and forgive us our wrong-doings, 
|     as we have forgiven those who have wronged us; 
|  [6:13]  and take us not into temptation, 
|     but deliver us from evil.’ 

[6:14]  For, if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; [6:15]  but, if you do not forgive others their offenses, not even your Father will forgive your offenses. 

[6:16]  “And, when you fast, do not put on gloomy looks, as hypocrites do who disfigure their faces so that they may be seen by people to be fasting. That, I tell you, is their reward! [6:17]  But, when one of you fasts, they should anoint their head and wash their face, [6:18]  so that they may not be seen by people to be fasting, but by their Father who dwells in secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them. 

[6:19]  “Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. [6:20]  But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal. [6:21]  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. [6:22]  The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up; [6:23]  but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be! [6:24]  No one can serve two masters, for either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money. 

[6:25]  “This is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life – what you can get to eat or drink, or about your body – what you can get to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [6:26]  Look at the wild birds – they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them! Aren’t you more precious than they? [6:27]  But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong their life a single moment? [6:28]  And why be anxious about clothing? Study the wild lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; [6:29]  yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his splendor was not robed like one of these. [6:30]  If God so clothes even the grass of the field, which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith? [6:31]  Do not then ask anxiously ‘What can we get to eat?’ or ‘What can we get to drink?’ or ‘What can we get to wear?’ [6:32]  All these are the things for which the nations are seeking, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [6:33]  But first seek his kingdom and the righteousness that he requires, and then all these things will be added for you. [6:34]  Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own anxieties. Every day has trouble enough of its own. 

 [Matthew 7] 

[7:1]  “Do not judge and you will not be judged. [7:2]  For, just as you judge others, you will yourselves be judged, and the standard that you use will be used for you. [7:3]  Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your friend’s eye, while you pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in yours? [7:4]  How will you say to your friend ‘Let me take out the speck from your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own? [7:5]  Hypocrite! Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly how to take out the speck from your friend’s. 

[7:6]  “Do not give what is sacred to dogs; they will turn and maul you. Do not throw your pearls before pigs; they will trample them underfoot. [7:7]  Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. [7:8]  For the person who asks receives, the person who searches finds, and to the door will be opened to the person who knocks. [7:9]  Who among you, when their child asks them for bread, will give them a stone, [7:10]  or when they ask for a fish, will give them a snake? [7:11]  If you, then, wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask him! 

[7:12]  “Do to others whatever you would wish them to do to you; for that is the teaching of both the Law and the prophets. [7:13]  Go in by the small gate. The road that leads to destruction is broad and spacious, and many go in by it. [7:14]  For the gate is small, and the road narrow, that leads to life, and there are few who find it. 

[7:15]  “Beware of false teachers – people who come to you in the guise of sheep, but at heart they are ravenous wolves. [7:16]  By the fruit of their lives you will know them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? [7:17]  So, too, every sound tree bears good fruit, while a worthless tree bears bad fruit. [7:18]  A sound tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a worthless tree bear good fruit. [7:19]  Every tree that fails to bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. [7:20]  So it is by the fruit of their lives that you will know such people. [7:21]  Not everyone who says to me ‘Master! Master!’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [7:22]  On ‘that day’ many will say to me ‘Master, Master, was not it in your name that we taught, and in your name that we drove out demons, and in your name that we did many miracles?’ [7:23]  And then I will say to them plainly ‘I never knew you. Go from my presence, you who live in sin.’ 

[7:24]  “Everyone, therefore, who listens to this teaching of mine and acts on it may be compared to a prudent person, who built their house on the rock. [7:25]  The rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, for its foundations were on the rock. [7:26]  Everyone who listens to this teaching of mine and does not act on it may be compared to a foolish person, who built their house on the sand. [7:27]  The rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and struck against that house, and it fell with a great crash.” 

[7:28] By the time that Jesus had finished speaking, the crowd was filled with amazement at his teaching.[7:29] For he taught them like one who had authority, and not like their teachers of the Law.

 [Matthew 8] 


[8:1] When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.[8:2] He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”[8:3] Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so,  “I am willing; become clean.”  Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;[8:4] and then Jesus said to him,  “Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” [8:5] After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help.[8:6] “Sir,” he said, “my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.”

[8:7]  “I will come and cure him,”  answered Jesus.[8:8] “Sir,” the captain went on, “I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured.[8:9] For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”[8:10] Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him,  “Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this! [8:11]  Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; [8:12]  while the heirs to the kingdom will be banished into the darkness outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.” [8:13] Then Jesus said to the captain,  “Go now, and it will be according to your faith.”  And the man was cured that very hour.

[8:14] When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever.[8:15] On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him.[8:16] In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,[8:17] in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – ‘He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.’

[8:18] Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across.[8:19] A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”

[8:20]  “Foxes have holes,”  answered Jesus,  “and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” [8:21] “Master,” said another, who was a disciple, “let me first go and bury my father.”[8:22] But Jesus answered,  “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.” [8:23] Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples.[8:24] Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;[8:25] and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!”

[8:26]  “Why are you so timid?”  he said.  “You of little faith!”  Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.[8:27] The men were amazed, and exclaimed, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!”

[8:28] On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.[8:29] Suddenly they shrieked out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?”[8:30] A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding;[8:31] and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.”

[8:32]  “Go,”  he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water.[8:33] At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.[8:34] At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region.

 [Matthew 9] 

[9:1] Afterward Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city.[9:2] There some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  “Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.” [9:3] Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”[9:4] Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed,  “Why do your cherish such wicked thoughts? [9:5]  Which, I ask, is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’? [9:6]  But to show you that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”  – then he said to the paralyzed man –  “Get up, take up your bed, and return to your home.” [9:7] The man got up and went to his home.[9:8] When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings.

[9:9] As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  “Follow me.”  Matthew got up and followed him.

[9:10] And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples.[9:11] When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax-gatherers and outcasts?”[9:12] On hearing this, Jesus said,  “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. [9:13]  Go and learn what this means – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice’; for I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” [9:14] Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?”[9:15] Jesus answered,  “Can the groom’s friends mourn as long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then. [9:16]  Nobody ever puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for such a patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. [9:17]  Nor do people put new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the skins burst, and the wine runs out, and the skins are lost; but they put new wine into fresh skins, and so both are preserved.” 

[9:18] While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. “My daughter,” he said, “has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.”[9:19] So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also.[9:20] But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak.[9:21] “If I only touch his cloak,” she said to herself, “I will get well.”[9:22] Turning and seeing her, Jesus said,  “Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.”  And at that very moment she became well.[9:23] When Jesus reached the leader’s house, seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion,[9:24] he said,  “Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.”  They began to laugh at him;[9:25] but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose.[9:26] The report of this spread through all that part of the country.

[9:27] As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, “Take pity on us, Son of David!”[9:28] When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them,  “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”  “Yes, Master!” they answered.[9:29] Then he touched their eyes, and said,  “It will be according to your faith.” [9:30] Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them.  “See that no one knows of it,”  he said.[9:31] But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country.[9:32] Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon;[9:33] and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”[9:34] But the Pharisees said, “He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.”

[9:35] Jesus went around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.[9:36] But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd;[9:37] and he said to his disciples,  “The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. [9:38]  Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send laborers to gather in his harvest.” 

 [Matthew 10] 

[10:1] Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.[10:2] The names of the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;[10:3] Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gather; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;[10:4] Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot – the apostle who betrayed him.

[10:5] These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them these instructions –  “Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any Samaritan town, [10:6]  but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel. [10:7]  On your way proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. [10:8]  Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have received free of cost, give free of cost. [10:9]  Do not provide yourselves with gold, or silver, or coins in your purses; [10:10]  not even with a bag for the journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals, or even a staff; for the worker is worth his food. [10:11]  Whatever town or village you visit, find out who is worthy in that place, and remain there until you leave. [10:12]  As you enter the house, greet it. [10:13]  Then, if the house is worthy, let your blessing rest on it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return on yourselves. [10:14]  If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet. [10:15]  I tell you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in the day of judgment than the doom of that town. 

[10:16]  “Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes, and as blameless as doves. [10:17]  Be on your guard against others, for they will betray you to courts of law, and scourge you in their synagogues; [10:18]  and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake so that you may witness for me before them and the nations. [10:19]  Whenever they betray you, do not be anxious as to how you will speak or what you will say, for what you will say will be given you at the moment; [10:20]  for it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you. [10:21]  Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; [10:22]  and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. [10:23]  But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. [10:24]  A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. [10:25]  It is enough for a student to be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! [10:26]  Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not become known. [10:27]  What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops. [10:28]  Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. [10:29]  Are not two sparrows sold for a one copper coin? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge. [10:30]  While as for you, even the hairs of your head are numbered. [10:31]  Do not, therefore, be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. [10:32]  Everyone, therefore, who will publicly acknowledge me, I, too, will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; [10:33]  but, if anyone publicly disowns me, I, too, will disown him before my Father who is in heaven. 

[10:34]  “Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come to bring, not peace, but the sword. [10:35]  For I have come to set – a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. [10:36]  A person’s enemies will be the members of their own household. [10:37]  Anyone who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. [10:38]  Anyone who does not take their cross and follow in my steps is not worthy of me. [10:39]  The person who has found their life will lose it, while the person who, for my sake, has lost their life will find it. 

[10:40]  “Anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. [10:41]  The person who welcomes a prophet, because they are a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward; and anyone who welcomes a good person, because they are a good person, will receive a good person’s reward. [10:42]  And, if anyone gives but a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because they are a disciple, I tell you that they will assuredly not lose their reward.” 

 [Matthew 11] 

[11:1] After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns.

[11:2] Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples,[11:3] and asked – “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?”[11:4] The answer of Jesus to the question was –  “Go and report to John what you hear and see – [11:5]  the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor. [11:6]  Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.” 

[11:7] While John’s disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John,[11:8]  “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings! [11:9]  What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. [11:10]  This is the man of whom scripture says – ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.’ [11:11]  I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. [11:12]  From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it. [11:13]  For the teaching of all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John; [11:14]  and – if you are ready to accept it – John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come. [11:15]  If you have ears, listen. [11:16]  But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates – [11:17]  We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned. [11:18]  For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said ‘He has a demon in him’; [11:19]  and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts!’ And yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions.” 

[11:20] Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented,[11:21]  “Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. [11:22]  Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours. [11:23]  And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day. [11:24]  Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.” [11:25] At that same time Jesus uttered the words,  “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the child-like! [11:26]  Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you. [11:27]  Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him. [11:28]  Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest! [11:29]  Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls; [11:30]  for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” 

 [Matthew 12] 

[12:1] About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat and eat them.[12:2] But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!”

[12:3]  “Haven’t you read,”  replied Jesus,  “what David did, when he and his companions were hungry – [12:4]  how he went into the house of God, and how they ate the consecrated bread, through it was not allowable for him or his companions to eat it, but only for the priests? [12:5]  And haven’t you read in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priest in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are not guilty? [12:6]  Here, however, I tell you, there is something greater than the Temple! [12:7]  Had you learned the meaning of the words – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned those who are not guilty. [12:8]  For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” 

[12:9] Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue,[12:10] and there he saw a man with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable to work a cure on the Sabbath – so that they might have a charge to bring against him.[12:11] But Jesus said to them,  “Which of you, if he had only one sheep, and that sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not lay hold of it and pull it out? [12:12]  How much more precious a person is than a sheep! Therefore it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath.” [12:13] Then he said to the man.  “Stretch out your hand.”  The man stretched it out; and it had become as sound as the other.[12:14] On coming out, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus, to put him to death.

[12:15] Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place. A number of people followed him, and he cured them all;[12:16] but he warned them not to make him known,[12:17] in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah –[12:18] ‘Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment to the Gentiles.[12:19] He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets;[12:20] a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment to a victorious issue,[12:21] and on his name will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’

[12:22] Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both talked and saw.[12:23] At this all the people were astounded. “Is it possible that this is the son of David?” they exclaimed.[12:24] But the Pharisees heard of it and said, “He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the chief of the demons.”[12:25] Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in their minds, and said to them,  “Any kingdom divided against itself becomes a desolation, and any town or household divided against itself will not last. [12:26]  So, if Satan drives Satan out, he must be divided against himself; and how, then, can his kingdom last? [12:27]  And, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges. [12:28]  But, if it is by the help of the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. [12:29]  How, again, can anyone get into a strong man’s house and carry off his goods, without first securing him? Not until then will he plunder his house. [12:30]  Anyone who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering. [12:31]  Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and slander; but slander against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. [12:32]  Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the present age, or in the age to come. 

[12:33]  “You must assume either that both tree and fruit are good, or that both tree and fruit are worthless; since it is by its fruits that a tree is known. [12:34]  You children of snakes! How can you, evil as you are, say anything good? For what fills the heart will rise to the lips. [12:35]  A good person, from his good stores, produces good things; while an evil person, from his evil stores, produces evil things. [12:36]  I tell you that for every careless thing that people say, they must answer on the ‘day of judgment.’ [12:37]  For it is by your words that you will be acquitted, and by your words that you will be condemned.” 

[12:38] At this point, some teachers of the Law and Pharisees spoke up. “Teacher,” they said, “we want to see some sign from you.”

[12:39]  “It is a wicked and unfaithful generation,”  answered Jesus,  “that is asking for a sign, and no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. [12:40]  For, just as Jonah was inside the sea-monster three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. [12:41]  At the judgment, the people of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! [12:42]  At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the present generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! [12:43]  No sooner does a foul spirit leave a person, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest, and does not find it. [12:44]  Then it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’; but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, and swept, and put in order. [12:45]  Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that man proves to be worse than the first. So, too, will it be with this wicked generation.” 

[12:46] While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.[12:47] Someone told him this, and Jesus replied,[12:48]  “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?” [12:49] Then, stretching out his hands towards his disciples, he said,  “Here are my mother and my brothers! [12:50]  For anyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” 

 [Matthew 13] 

[13:1] That same day, when Jesus had left the house and was sitting by the sea,[13:2] such great crowds gathered around him, that he got into a boat, and sat in it, while all the people stood on the beach.[13:3] Then he told them many truths in parables.  “The sower,”  he began,  “went out to sow; and, [13:4]  as they were sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. [13:5]  Some fell on rocky places, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once. [13:6]  As soon as the sun had risen, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. [13:7]  Some, again, fell into the brambles; but the brambles shot up and choked it. [13:8]  Some, however, fell on good soil, and yielded a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold. [13:9]  Let those who have ears hear.” 

[13:10] Afterward his disciples came to him, and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”

[13:11]  “To you,”  answered Jesus,  “the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of heaven has been imparted, but not to those. [13:12]  For, to all who have, more will be given, and they will have abundance; but, from all who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. [13:13]  That is why I speak to them in parables, because, though they have eyes, they do not see, and though they have ears, they do not hear or understand. [13:14]  In them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says –

|  ‘You will hear with your ears without ever understanding,
|    and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving, 
|  [13:15]  for the mind of this nation has grown dense,
|    and their ears are dull of hearing,
|    their eyes also have they closed;
|  Otherwise some day they might perceive with their eyes,
|    and with their ears they might hear,
|    and in their mind they might understand,
|    and might turn –
|  and I might heal them.’ 

[13:16]  “But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear; [13:17]  for I tell you that many prophets and good people have longed for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never saw them, and to hear the things which you are hearing, yet never heard them. 

[13:18]  “Listen, then, yourselves to the parable of the sower. [13:19]  When anyone hears the message of the kingdom without understanding it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in their mind. This is the person meant by the seed which was sown along the path. [13:20]  By the seed which was sown on rocky places is meant the person who hears the message, and at once accepts it joyfully; [13:21]  but, as they have no root, they stand for only a short time; and, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. [13:22]  By the seed which was sown among the brambles is meant the person who hears the message, but the cares of life and the glamour of wealth completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. [13:23]  But by the seed which was sown on the good ground is meant the person who hears the message and understands it, and really yields a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.” 

[13:24] Another parable which Jesus told them was this –  “The kingdom of heaven is compared to a person who sowed good seed in their field. [13:25]  But, while everyone was asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. [13:26]  So, when the blades of corn shot up, and came into ear, the weeds made their appearance also. [13:27]  The owner’s servants came to them, and said ‘Was not it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where, then, do the weeds in it come from?’ [13:28]  ‘An enemy has done this,’ was the owner’s answer. ‘Do you wish us, then,’ they asked, ‘to go and gather them together?’ [13:29]  ‘No,’ said he, ‘because while you are pulling up the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them. [13:30]  Let both grow side by side until harvest; and then I will say to the reapers, Gather the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles for burning; but bring all the wheat into my barn.’” 

[13:31] Another parable which he told them was this –  “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his field. [13:32]  This seed is smaller than all other seeds, but, when it has grown up, it is larger than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that ‘the wild birds come and roost in its branches.’” 

[13:33] This was another parable which Jesus related –  “The kingdom of heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.” [13:34] Of all this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all except in parables,[13:35] in fulfillment of these words in the prophet – ‘I will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world.’

[13:36] Then Jesus left the crowd, and went into the house. Presently his disciples came to him, and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”[13:37] He answered,  “The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man. [13:38]  The field is the world. By the good seed is meant the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the wicked, [13:39]  and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest time is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. [13:40]  And, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so it will be at the close of the age. [13:41]  The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all that hinders and those who live in sin, [13:42]  and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. [13:43]  Then will the righteous shine, like the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. If you have ears, listen. 

[13:44]  “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person found and hid again, and then, in their delight, went and sold everything that they had, and bought that field. 

[13:45]  “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of choice pearls. [13:46]  Finding one of great value, they went and sold everything that they had, and bought it. [13:47]  Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was cast into the sea, and caught fish of all kinds. [13:48]  When it was full, they hauled it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless ones away. [13:49]  So will it be at the close of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous, [13:50]  and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. 

[13:51]  “Have you understood all this?”  Jesus asked. “Yes,” they answered.[13:52] Then he added,  “So every teacher of the Law, who has received instruction about the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who produces from his stores things both new and old.” 

[13:53] When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place.[13:54] Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this wisdom?” they said, “and the miracles?[13:55] Isn’t he the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?[13:56] And his sisters, too – are not they all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?”[13:57] These things proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said,  “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.” [13:58] He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith.

 [Matthew 14] 

[14:1] At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus,[14:2] and said to his attendants, “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”[14:3] For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.[14:4] For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’[14:5] Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet.[14:6] But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,[14:7] that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.[14:8] Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’[14:9] The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her.[14:10] He had John beheaded in the prison[14:11] and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.[14:12] Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.

[14:13] When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot.[14:14] On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them.[14:15] In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can to the villages, and buy themselves food.”[14:16] But Jesus said,  “They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.” [14:17] “We have nothing here,” they said, “except five loaves and two fish.”

[14:18]  “Bring them here to me,”  was his reply.[14:19] Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds.[14:20] Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets.[14:21] The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.[14:22] Immediately afterward Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds.[14:23] After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone.[14:24] The boat was by this time some miles from shore, laboring in the waves, for the wind was against her.[14:25] Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water.[14:26] But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear.[14:27] But Jesus at once spoke to them.  “Courage!”  he said,  “It is I; do not be afraid!” [14:28] “Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.”[14:29] Jesus said,  “Come.”  So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus;[14:30] but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Master! Save me!”[14:31] Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him.  “You of little faith!”  he said,  “Why did you falter?” [14:32] When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped.[14:33] But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, “You are indeed God’s Son.”

[14:34] When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.[14:35] But the people of that place, recognizing Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill,[14:36] begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well.

 [Matthew 15] 

[15:1] Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said,[15:2] “How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.”[15:3] His reply was,  “How is it that you on your side break God’s commandments out of respect for your own traditions? [15:4]  For God said – ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who abuses his father or mother shall suffer death,’ [15:5]  but you say ‘Whenever anyone says to his father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for God,” [15:6]  he is in no way bound to honor his father.’ In this way you have nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions. [15:7]  Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you – [15:8]  ‘This is a people that honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me; [15:9]  but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’” [15:10] Then Jesus called the people to him, and said,  “Listen, and mark my words. [15:11]  It is not what enters a person’s mouth that defiles them, but what comes out from their mouth – that does defile them!” [15:12] His disciples came up to him, and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?”

[15:13]  “Every plant,”  Jesus replied,  “that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. [15:14]  Leave them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind person guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.” [15:15] Peter spoke up, “Explain this saying to us.”

[15:16]  “What, do even you understand nothing yet?”  Jesus exclaimed.[15:17]  “Don’t you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterward expelled? [15:18]  But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a person; [15:19]  for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts – murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, perjury, slander. [15:20]  These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.” 

[15:21] On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country around Tyre and Sidon.[15:22] There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, “Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.”[15:23] But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. “She keeps calling out after us,” they said.[15:24]  “I was not sent,”  replied Jesus,  “to anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.” [15:25] But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, “Master, help me.”

[15:26]  “It is not fair,”  replied Jesus,  “to take the children’s food and throw it to dogs.” [15:27] “Yes, Master,” she said, “for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.”

[15:28]  “Your faith is great,”  was his reply to the woman,  “it will be as you wish!”  And her daughter was cured that very hour.

[15:29] On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down.[15:30] Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;[15:31] and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.[15:32] Afterward Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,  “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.” [15:33] “Where can we,” his disciples asked, “in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?”

[15:34]  “How many loaves have you?”  said Jesus. “Seven,” they answered, “and a few small fish.”[15:35] Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,[15:36] Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.[15:37] Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.[15:38] The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.[15:39] Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.

 [Matthew 16] 

[16:1] Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens.[16:2] But Jesus answered,  “In the evening you say ‘It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.’ [16:3]  But in the morning you say ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.’ You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times! [16:4]  A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”  So he left them and went away.

[16:5] Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread.[16:6] Presently Jesus said to them, “Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”[16:7] But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread.[16:8] On noticing this, Jesus said,  “Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith? [16:9]  Don’t you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away? [16:10]  Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away? [16:11]  How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” [16:12] Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

[16:13] On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question –  “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” [16:14] “Some say John the Baptist,” they answered, “Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”

[16:15]  “But you,”  he said,  “who do you say that I am?” [16:16] To this Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

[16:17]  “Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,”  Jesus replied.  “For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. [16:18]  Yes, and I say to you, your name is ‘Peter’ – a Rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it. [16:19]  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.” [16:20] Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.

[16:21] At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.[16:22] But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. “Master,” he said, “please God that will never be your fate!”[16:23] Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said,  “Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as person does.” [16:24] Then Jesus said to his disciples,  “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me. [16:25]  For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it. [16:26]  What good will it do a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will a person give that is of equal value with his life? [16:27]  For the Son of Man is to come in his Father’s glory, with his angels, and then he will give to everyone what his actions deserve. [16:28]  I tell you, some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man coming into his kingdom.” 

 [Matthew 17] 

[17:1] Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone.[17:2] There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shown like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.[17:3] All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.[17:4] “Master,” exclaimed Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”[17:5] While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.”[17:6] The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid.[17:7] But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so,  “Rise up, and do not be afraid.” [17:8] When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone.[17:9] As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning –  “Do not speak of this vision to anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” [17:10] “How is it,” his disciples asked, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?”

[17:11]  “Elijah indeed does come,”  Jesus replied,  “and will restore everything; [17:12]  and I tell you that Elijah has already come, and people have not recognized him, but have treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, too, the Son of Man is destined to undergo suffering at people’s hands.” [17:13] Then the disciples understood that it was of John the Baptist that he had spoken to them.

[17:14] When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said,[17:15] “Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the water;[17:16] I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”

[17:17]  “Faithless and perverse generation!”  Jesus exclaimed,  “how long must I be among you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy here to me.” [17:18] Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy; and he was cured from that very hour.[17:19] Afterward the disciples came up to Jesus, and asked him privately, “Why was it that we could not drive it out?”

[17:20]  “Because you have so little faith!”  he answered,  “For, I tell you, if your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain ‘Move from this place to that!’ and it would be moved; and nothing would be impossible to you.” [17:21] ^[ 17:21 Some later manuscripts add: But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.]

[17:22] While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to them,  “The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into human hands, [17:23]  and they will put him to death, but on the third day he will rise.”  The disciples were greatly distressed.

[17:24] After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple-rate came up to Peter, and said, “Does not your Master pay the Temple-rate?”

[17:25] “Yes,” answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said,  “What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings take taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?” [17:26] “From others,” answered Peter.  “Well then,”  continued Jesus,  “their sons go free. [17:27]  Still, so we don’t offend them, go and throw a line into the sea; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth, and you will find in it a piece of money. Take that, and give it to the collectors for both of us.” 

 [Matthew 18] 

[18:1] On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him, “Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”[18:2] Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said,[18:3]  “I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven at all. [18:4]  Therefore, anyone who will humble themselves like this child – that person will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. [18:5]  And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even one little child like this, is welcoming me. [18:6]  But, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung around their neck. [18:7]  Alas for the world because of such temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! 

[18:8]  “If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed or lame, than to have both hands, or both feet, and be thrown into the fire that never goes out. [18:9]  If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna. [18:10]  Beware of despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. [18:11] ^[ 18:11  Some later manuscripts add: For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.]

[18:12]  “What think you? If a person owns a hundred sheep, and one of them strays, will the person not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go and search for the one that is straying? [18:13]  And, if they succeed in finding it, I tell you that they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine which did not stray. [18:14]  So, too, it is the will of my Father who is in heaven that not one of these little ones should be lost. 

[18:15]  “If your brother or sister does wrong, go to them and convince them of their fault when you are both alone. If they listen to you, you have won them over. [18:16]  But, if they do not listen to you, take with you one or two others, so that on the evidence of two or three witnesses, every word may be put beyond dispute. [18:17]  If they refuse to listen to them, speak to the church; and, if they also refuse to listen to the church, treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax-gatherer. 

[18:18]  “I tell you, all that you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and all that you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed. [18:19]  Again, I tell you that, if but two of you on earth agree as to what they will pray for, whatever it be, it will be granted them by my Father who is in heaven. [18:20]  For where two or three have come together in my name, I am present with them.” 

[18:21] Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus, “Master, how often am I to forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?”[18:22] But Jesus answered,  “Not seven times, but seventy times seven. [18:23]  Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. [18:24]  When he had begun to do so, one of them was brought to him who owed him ten thousand bags of gold; [18:25]  and, as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he had. [18:26]  The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ [18:27]  The master was moved with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt. [18:28]  But, on going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said ‘Pay what you owe me.’ [18:29]  His fellow servant threw himself on the ground and begged for mercy. ‘Have patience with me,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you.’ [18:30]  But the other would not, but went and put him in prison until he should pay his debt. [18:31]  When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and went to their master and laid the whole matter before him. [18:32]  So the master sent for the servant, and said to him ‘You wicked servant! When you begged me for mercy, I forgave you the whole of that debt. [18:33]  Shouldn’t you, also, to have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?’ [18:34]  Then his master, in anger, handed him over to the jailers, until he should pay the whole of his debt. [18:35]  So, also, will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.” 

 [Matthew 19] 

##### The Journey to Jerusalem #####

[19:1] At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan.[19:2] Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.[19:3] Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, “Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?”

[19:4]  “Haven’t you read,”  replied Jesus,  “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ [19:5]  and said – ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one’? [19:6]  So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.” [19:7] “Why, then,” they said, “did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?”

[19:8]  “Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,”  answered Jesus,  “permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning. [19:9]  But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.” [19:10] “If that,” said the disciples, “is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.”

[19:11]  “It is not everyone,”  replied Jesus,  “who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so. [19:12]  Some men, it is true, have from birth been disabled for marriage, while others have been disabled by their fellow men, and others again have disabled themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Accept this if you can.” 

[19:13] Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them.[19:14] Jesus, however, said,  “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.” [19:15] So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way.

[19:16] A man came up to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”

[19:17]  “Why ask me about goodness?”  answered Jesus.  “There is but One who is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.” [19:18] “What commandments?” asked the man.  “These,”  answered Jesus, –  “‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others. [19:19]  Honor your father and your mother.’ And ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’” [19:20] “I have observed all these,” said the young man. “What is still wanting in me?”

[19:21]  “If you wish to be perfect,”  answered Jesus,  “go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” [19:22] On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions.[19:23] At this, Jesus said to his disciples,  “I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven! [19:24]  I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!” [19:25] On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, “Who then can possibly be saved?”[19:26] But Jesus looked at them, and said,  “With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.”  Then Peter turned and said to Jesus,[19:27] “But we – we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?”

[19:28]  “I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. [19:29]  Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life. [19:30]  But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first. 

 [Matthew 20] 

[20:1]  For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyards. [20:2]  He agreed with the laborers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard. [20:3]  On going out again, about nine o’clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing. [20:4]  ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you what is fair.’ [20:5]  So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o’clock, he did as before. [20:6]  When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them ‘Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’ [20:7]  ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said. [20:8]  In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward ‘Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.’ [20:9]  Now when those who had been hired about five o’clock went up, they received two silver coins each. [20:10]  So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each; [20:11]  at which they began to grumble at their employer. [20:12]  ‘These last,’ they said, ‘have done only one hour’s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day’s work, and the heat.’ [20:13]  ‘My friend,’ was his reply to one of them, ‘I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me for two silver coins? [20:14]  Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you. [20:15]  Don’t I have the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am liberal?’ [20:16]  So those who are last will be first, and the first last.” 

[20:17] When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples around him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way,[20:18]  “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, [20:19]  and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.” 

[20:20] Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favor.[20:21]  “What is it that you want?”  he asked. “I want you to say,” she replied, “that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.”

[20:22]  “You do not know what you are asking,”  was Jesus’ answer.  “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?”  “Yes,” they exclaimed, “we can.”

[20:23]  “You will indeed drink my cup,”  he said,  “but as to a seat at my right and at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” [20:24] On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.[20:25] Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said,  “The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them. [20:26]  Among you it is not so. [20:27]  No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave; [20:28]  just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 

[20:29] As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.[20:30] Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”[20:31] The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”[20:32] Then Jesus stopped and called them.  “What do you want me to do for you?”  he said.[20:33] “Master,” they replied, “we want our eyes to be opened.”[20:34] So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.

 [Matthew 21] 

##### The Last Days #####

[21:1] When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.[21:2]  “Go to the village facing you,”  he said,  “and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me. [21:3]  And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants them’; and he will send them at once.” [21:4] This happened in fulfillment of these words in the prophet –[21:5] ‘Say to the people of Zion – “Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.”’

[21:6] So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.[21:7] They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them.[21:8] The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.[21:9] The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, “God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!”[21:10] When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked –[21:11] “Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied – “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”

[21:12] Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,[21:13] and said to them,  “Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.” [21:14] While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.[21:15] But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant,[21:16] and said to him, “Do you hear what these boys are saying?”

 “Yes,”  answered Jesus,  “but did you never read the words – ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?” 

[21:17] Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.

[21:18] The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;[21:19] and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it,  “Never again will fruit be gathered off you.”  And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.[21:20] When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, “How suddenly the fig tree withered up!”

[21:21]  “I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’ it would be done. [21:22]  And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.” 

[21:23] After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”

[21:24]  “I, too,”  said Jesus in reply,  “will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. [21:25]  It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’ [21:26] But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.”[21:27] So the answer they gave Jesus was – “We do not know.”

 “Then I,”  he said,  “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things. [21:28]  What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said ‘Go and work in the vineyard today my son.’ [21:29]  ‘Yes, sir,’ he answered; but he did not go. [21:30]  Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. ‘I will not,’ he answered; but afterward he was sorry and went. [21:31]  Which of the two sons did as his father wished?”  “The second,” they said.  “I tell you,”  added Jesus,  “that tax-gatherers and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you. [21:32]  For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax-gatherers and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him. 

[21:33]  “Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. [21:34]  When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce. [21:35]  But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. [21:36]  A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way. [21:37]  As a last resource he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. [21:38]  But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.’ [21:39]  So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him. [21:40]  Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” [21:41] “Miserable wretches!” they exclaimed, “he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.”[21:42] Then Jesus added,  “Have you never read in the scriptures? – ‘The stone which the builders despised – has now itself become the corner-stone. This corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’ [21:43]  That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom. [21:44]  Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.” 

[21:45] After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;[21:46] yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet.

 [Matthew 22] 

[22:1] Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.[22:2]  “The kingdom of heaven,” he said, “may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honor of his son’s wedding. [22:3]  He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come. [22:4]  A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited ‘I have prepared my breakfast, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.’ [22:5]  They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to their farm, another to their business; [22:6]  while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them. [22:7]  The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire. [22:8]  Then he said to his servants ‘The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy. [22:9]  So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.’ [22:10]  The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests. [22:11]  But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe. [22:12]  So he said to him ‘My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?’ The man was speechless. [22:13]  Then the king said to the attendants ‘Tie him hand and foot, and put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ [22:14]  For many are called, but few chosen.” 

[22:15] Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation.[22:16] They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position.[22:17] Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?”[22:18] Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered,  “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? [22:19]  Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.”  And, when they had brought him a coin,[22:20] he asked,  “Whose head and title are these?” [22:21] “The Emperor’s,” they answered, at which he said to them,  “Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” [22:22] They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away.

[22:23] That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, –[22:24] “Teacher, Moses said – ‘should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.’[22:25] Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother.[22:26] The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven.[22:27] The woman herself died last of all.[22:28] At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?”

[22:29]  “Your mistake,”  replied Jesus,  “is due to your ignorance of the scriptures, and of the power of God. [22:30]  For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven. [22:31]  As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God – [22:32]  ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of dead people, but of living.” [22:33] The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.

[22:34] When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together.[22:35] Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question –[22:36] “Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?”[22:37] His answer was,  “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. [22:38]  This is the great first commandment. [22:39]  The second, which is like it, is this – You must love your neighbor as you love yourself. [22:40]  On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.” [22:41] Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them –[22:42]  “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”  “David’s,” they said.[22:43]  “How is it, then,”  Jesus replied,  “that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him ‘lord,’ in the passage – [22:44]  ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet’? [22:45]  Since, then, David calls him ‘lord,’ how is he David’s son?” [22:46] No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further.

 [Matthew 23] 

[23:1] Then Jesus speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said,[23:2]  “The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees now occupy the chair of Moses. [23:3]  Therefore practice and lay to heart everything that they tell preach but do not practice. [23:4]  While they make up heavy loads and pile them on other people’s shoulder’s they decline, themselves, to lift a finger to move them. [23:5]  All their actions are done to attract attention. They widen their phylacteries, and increase the size of their tassels, [23:6]  and like to have the place of honor at dinner, and the best seats in the synagogues, [23:7]  and to be greeted in the markets with respect, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ for everybody. [23:8]  But do not allow yourselves to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and you yourselves are all brothers and sisters. [23:9]  And do not call anyone on the earth your ‘Father,’ for your have only one Father, the heavenly Father. [23:10]  Nor must you allow yourselves to be called ‘leaders,’ for you have only one leader, the Christ. [23:11]  The person who wants to be the greatest among you must be your servant. [23:12]  Whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted. [23:13]  But alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You turn the key of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you do not go in yourselves, and do not allow those who try to go in to do so. [23:14] ^[ 23:14  Some later manuscripts add: Alas for you teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You devour widows’ property, and pray long prayers just for show! This is why you will receive a more severe punishment.][23:15]  Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You scour land and sea to make a single convert, and, when they are gained, you make them twice as deserving of Gehenna as you are yourselves. [23:16]  Alas for you, you blind guides! You say ‘if any answer by the Temple, their oath counts for nothing; but, if anyone swears by the gold of the Temple, their oath is binding them’! [23:17]  Fools that you are and blind! Which is the more important? The gold? Or the Temple which has given sacredness to the gold? [23:18]  You say, too, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, their oath counts for nothing, but, if anyone swears by the offering placed on it, their oath is binding on them’! [23:19]  Blind indeed! Which is the more important? The offering? Or the altar which gives sacredness to the offering? [23:20]  Therefore a person, swearing by the altar, swears by it and by all that is on it, [23:21]  and a person, swearing by the Temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it, [23:22]  while a person, swearing by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it. [23:23]  Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You pay tithes on mint, fennel, and caraway seed, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law – justice, mercy, and good faith. These last you ought to have put into practice, without neglecting the first. [23:24]  You blind guides, to strain out a gnat and to swallow a camel! [23:25]  Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are filled with the results of greed and self-indulgence. [23:26]  You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well. [23:27]  Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed look fair outside, while inside they are filled with dead people’s bones and all kinds of filth. [23:28]  It is the same with you. Outwardly, and to others, you have the look of religious people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and sin. [23:29]  Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the monuments of religious people, [23:30]  and say ‘Had we been living in the days of our ancestors, we should have taken no part in their murder of the prophets!’ [23:31]  By doing this you are furnishing evidence against yourselves that you are true children of the people who murdered the prophets. [23:32]  Go on then, finish what your ancestors began! [23:33]  You snakes and children of snakes! How can you escape being sentenced to Gehenna? [23:34]  That is why I send you prophets, wise people, and teachers of the Law, some of whom you will crucify and kill, and some of whom you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from town to town; [23:35]  in order the blood on your heads may fall every drop of innocent blood split on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel down to that of Zechariah, Barachiah’s son, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar. [23:36]  All this, I tell you, will come home to the present generation. [23:37]  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! She who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to her – Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children around me, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not come! [23:38]  Verily, your house is left to you desolate! [23:39]  For nevermore, I tell you, will you see me, until you say – ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’” 

 [Matthew 24] 

[24:1] Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.[24:2]  “Do you see all these things?”  was his answer.  “I tell you, not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down,” [24:3] so, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him privately and said, “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the close of the age.”[24:4] Jesus replied to them,  “See that no one leads you astray; [24:5]  for, many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray. [24:6]  You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; take care not to be alarmed, for such things must occur; but the end is not yet here. [24:7]  For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. [24:8]  All this, however, will be but the beginning of the birth pangs! [24:9]  When that time comes, they will give you up to persecution, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. [24:10]  And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another. [24:11]  Many false prophets, also, will appear and lead many astray; [24:12]  and, owing to the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold. [24:13]  Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. [24:14]  This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations; and then will come the end. [24:15]  As soon, then, as you see ‘the Foul Desecration,’ mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy place,”  (the reader must consider what this means)[24:16]  “then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains; [24:17]  and a man on the housetop must not go down to get the things that are in his house; [24:18]  nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get his cloak. [24:19]  Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [24:20]  Pray, too, that your flight may not take place in winter, nor on a Sabbath; [24:21]  for that will be a time of great distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of the world down to the present time – no, nor ever will again. [24:22]  Had not those days been limited, not a single soul would escape; but for the sake of God’s people a limit will be put to them. [24:23]  At that time, if anyone should say to you ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’ or ‘Here he is!’, do not believe it; [24:24]  for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will display great signs and marvels, so that, were it possible, even God’s people would be led astray. [24:25]  Remember, I have told you beforehand. [24:26]  Therefore, if people say to you ‘He is in the wilderness!’, do not go out there; or ‘He is in an inner room!’, do not believe it; [24:27]  for, just as lightning will start from the east and flash across to the west, so will it be with the coming of the Son of Man. [24:28]  Wherever a dead body lies, there will the vultures flock. [24:29]  Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will fall from the heavens, and the forces of the heavens will be convulsed. [24:30]  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heavens; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the heavens, with power and great glory; [24:31]  and he will send his angels, with a great trumpet, and they will gather his people around him from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 

[24:32]  “Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near. [24:33]  And so may you, as soon as you see all these things, know that he is at your doors. [24:34]  I tell you, even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place. [24:35]  The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. [24:36]  But about that day and hour, no one knows – not even the angels of heaven, not even the Son – but only the Father himself. [24:37]  For, just as in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. [24:38]  In those days before the flood they went on eating and drinking, marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, [24:39]  taking not notice until the flood came and swept them one and all away; and so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. [24:40]  At that time, of two men on a farm one will be taken and one left; [24:41]  of two women grinding with a hand-mill one will be taken and one left. [24:42]  Therefore watch; for you cannot be sure on what day your Master is coming. [24:43]  But this you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time of night the thief was coming, they would have been on the watch, and would not have allowed their house to be broken into. [24:44]  Therefore, you must also prepare, since it is just when you are least expecting him that the Son of Man will come. [24:45]  Who, then is that trustworthy, careful servant, who has been placed by their master over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? [24:46]  Happy will that servant be whom their master, when he comes home, will find doing this. [24:47]  I tell you that their master will put them in charge of the whole of his property. [24:48]  But, should the servant be a bad servant, and say to themselves ‘My master is a long time in coming,’ [24:49]  and begin to beat their fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards, [24:50]  that servant’s master will come on a day when they do not expect him, and at an hour of which they are unaware, [24:51]  and will flog the servant severely, and assign them their place among the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. 

 [Matthew 25] 

[25:1]  “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom. [25:2]  Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent. [25:3]  The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them; [25:4]  while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars. [25:5]  As the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept. [25:6]  But at midnight a shout was raised – ‘The groom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ [25:7]  Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps, [25:8]  and the foolish said to the prudent ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ [25:9]  But the prudent ones answered ‘No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.’ [25:10]  But while they were on their way to buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut. [25:11]  Afterward the other bridesmaids came. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they said, ‘open the door to us!’ [25:12]  But the groom answered ‘I tell you, I do not know you.’ [25:13]  Therefore watch, since you know neither the day nor the hour. 

[25:14]  “For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge. [25:15]  He gave five bags of gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels. [25:16]  The servant who had received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made another five bags. [25:17]  So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of gold made another two bags. [25:18]  But the servant who had received the one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. [25:19]  After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them. [25:20]  The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up and brought five bags more. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!’ [25:21]  ‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’ [25:22]  Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came up and said ‘Sir, you entrusted me with two bags pounds; look, I have made another two!’ [25:23]  ‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’ [25:24]  The man who had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed; [25:25]  and, in my fear, I went and hid your money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!’ [25:26]  ‘You lazy, worthless servant!’ was his master’s reply. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed? [25:27]  Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest. [25:28]  Therefore,’ he continued, ‘take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has the ten bags. [25:29]  For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him. [25:30]  As for the useless servant, put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ 

[25:31]  “When the Son of Man has come in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will take his seat on his throne of glory; [25:32]  and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people – just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats – [25:33]  placing the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left. [25:34]  Then the king will say to those on his right ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter into possession of the kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of the world. [25:35]  For, when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was a stranger, you took me to your homes; [25:36]  when I was naked, you clothed me; when I fell ill, you visited me; and when I was in prison, you came to me.’ [25:37]  Then the righteous will answer ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and give you a drink? [25:38]  When did we see you a stranger, and take you to our homes? Or naked, and clothe you? [25:39]  When did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?’ [25:40]  And the king will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you did it to one of these my brothers or sisters, however unimportant they seemed, you did it to me.’ [25:41]  Then he will say to those on his left ‘Go from my presence, accursed, into the permanent fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. [25:42]  For, when I was hungry, you gave me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink; [25:43]  when I was a stranger, you did not take me to your homes; when I was naked, you did not clothe me; and, when I was ill and in prison, you did not visit me.’ [25:44]  Then they, in their turn, will answer ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not supply your wants?’ [25:45]  And then he will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you failed to do it to one of these, however unimportant, you failed to do it to me.’ [25:46]  And these last will go away into lasting correction, but the righteous into lasting life.” 

 [Matthew 26] 

[26:1] When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his disciples,[26:2]  “You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.” [26:3] Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,[26:4] and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death;[26:5] but they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.”

[26:6] After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper,[26:7] a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table.[26:8] The disciples were indignant at seeing this. “What is this waste for?” they exclaimed.[26:9] “It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.”

[26:10]  “Why are you troubling the woman?”  Jesus said, when he noticed it.  “For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me. [26:11]  You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. [26:12]  In pouring this perfume on my body, she has done it for my burying. [26:13]  I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” 

[26:14] It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests,[26:15] and said “What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?” The Priests weighed him out thirty pieces of silver as payment.[26:16] So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.

[26:17] On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, “Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”

[26:18]  “Go into the city to a certain man,”  he answered,  “and say to him ‘The teacher says – My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” [26:19] The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.[26:20] In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples,[26:21] and, while they were eating, he said,  “I tell you that one of you will betray me.” [26:22] In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, “Can it be I, Master?”

[26:23]  “The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,”  replied Jesus,  “is the one who will betray me. [26:24]  True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” [26:25] Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, “Can it be I, Rabbi?”

 “It is,”  answered Jesus.

[26:26] While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said,  “Take it and eat it; this is my body.” [26:27] Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words,  “Drink from it, all of you; [26:28]  for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. [26:29]  I tell you that I will never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.” 

[26:30] They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives.[26:31] Then Jesus said to them,  “Even you will all fall away from me tonight. Scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ [26:32]  But, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” [26:33] “If everyone else falls away from you,” Peter answered, “I will never fall away!”

[26:34]  “I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!” [26:35] “Even if I must die with you,” Peter exclaimed, “I will never disown you!” All the disciples spoke in the same way.

[26:36] Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,  “Sit down here while I go and pray over there.” [26:37] Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind.[26:38]  “I am sad at heart,”  he said,  “sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.” [26:39] Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer.  “My Father,”  he said,  “if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as you will.” [26:40] Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep.  “What!”  he said to Peter,  “could none of you watch with me for one hour? [26:41]  Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.” [26:42] Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed.  “My Father,”  he said,  “if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!” [26:43] And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.[26:44] So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.[26:45] Then he came to the disciples, and said,  “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look – my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. [26:46]  Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” [26:47] And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.[26:48] Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.”[26:49] So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him;[26:50] at which Jesus said to him,  “Friend, do what you have come for.”  The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.[26:51] Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear.[26:52]  “Sheathe your sword,”  Jesus said,  “for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword. [26:53]  Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels? [26:54]  But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?” [26:55] Jesus at the same time said to the crowds,  “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.” [26:56] The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the Prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.

[26:57] Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled.[26:58] Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end.[26:59] Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,[26:60] but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said,[26:61] “This man said ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”[26:62] Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”[26:63] But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”

[26:64]  “It is true,”  Jesus answered,  “Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.” [26:65] Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy![26:66] What is your decision?” They answered, “He deserves death.”[26:67] Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so,[26:68] “Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?”[26:69] Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!”[26:70] But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied.[26:71] When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”[26:72] Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”[26:73] But soon afterward those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, “You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!”[26:74] Then Peter said, “I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!” At that moment a cock crowed;[26:75] and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said –  ‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’;  and he went outside, and wept bitterly.

 [Matthew 27] 

[27:1] At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death.[27:2] They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate.[27:3] Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.[27:4] “I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,” he said. “What has that to do with us?” they replied. “You must see to that yourself.”[27:5] Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself.[27:6] The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.”[27:7] So, after consultation, they bought with them the ‘Potter’s Field’ for a burial-ground for foreigners;[27:8] and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day.[27:9] Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom some of the people of Israel valued,[27:10] and gave them for the Potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.’[27:11] Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked the Governor.  “It is true,”  answered Jesus.[27:12] While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply.[27:13] Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?”[27:14] Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished.[27:15] Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose.[27:16] At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.[27:17] So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, “Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called ‘Christ’?”[27:18] For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him.[27:19] While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – “Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very unhappy today in a dream because of him.”[27:20] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.[27:21] The Governor, however, said to them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?”

“Barabbas,” they answered.[27:22] “What then,” Pilate asked, “should I do with Jesus who is called ‘Christ?’” “Crucify him,” they all replied.[27:23] “Why, what harm has he done?” he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, “Crucify him!”[27:24] When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.”[27:25] And all the people answered, “His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!”[27:26] The Pilate released Barabbas to them; but Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.

[27:27] After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison around him.[27:28] They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak,[27:29] and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.[27:30] They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head;[27:31] and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified.

[27:32] As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene of the name of Simon; and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.[27:33] On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull),[27:34] they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it.[27:35] When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.[27:36] Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there.[27:37] Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – ‘THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’[27:38] At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left.[27:39] The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said,[27:40] “You who ‘destroy the Temple and build one in three days,’ save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”[27:41] In the same way the chief priests, with the Teaches of the Law and elders, said in mockery,[27:42] “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the ‘king of Israel’! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him.[27:43] He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said ‘I am God’s Son.’”[27:44] Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way.[27:45] After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon.[27:46] About three Jesus called out loudly,  “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani”  – that is to say,  ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ [27:47] Some of those standing by heard this, and said, “The man is calling for Elijah!”[27:48] One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink.[27:49] But the rest said, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”^[ 27:49  Some later manuscripts add: However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.][27:50] But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit.[27:51] Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder,[27:52] the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose,[27:53] and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.[27:54] The Roman captain, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, “This must indeed have been God’s Son!”[27:55] There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him.[27:56] Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.

[27:57] When evening had fallen, there came a rich man belonging to Ramah, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.[27:58] He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him.[27:59] So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet,[27:60] and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.[27:61] Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave.

[27:62] The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said,[27:63] “Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said  ‘I will rise after three days.’ [27:64] So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people ‘He has risen from the dead,’ when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.”

[27:65] “You may have a guard,” was Pilate’s reply. “Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.”[27:66] So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard.

 [Matthew 28] 

##### The Risen Life #####

[28:1] After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave,[28:2] when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it.[28:3] His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow;[28:4] and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men.[28:5] But the angel, addressing the women, said, “You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.[28:6] He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying;[28:7] and then go quickly and say to his disciples ‘He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Remember, I have told you.”[28:8] They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples.[28:9] Suddenly Jesus met them.  “Welcome!”  he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them,[28:10]  “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.” [28:11] While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.[28:12] So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,[28:13] and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;[28:14] “And should this matter come before the Governor,” they added, “we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.”[28:15] So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today.

[28:16] The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him;[28:17] and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful.[28:18] Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying,  “All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me. [28:19]  Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, [28:20]  and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.”

Good News According to
----------------------

Mark
====

 [Mark 1] 

##### The Preparation #####

[1:1] The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.

[1:2] It is said in the prophet Isaiah –

|  ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you;
|    he will prepare your way.
|  [1:3] The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
|    “Prepare the road for the Lord,
|      make a straight path for him.”’

[1:4] John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.[1:5] The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

[1:6] John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;[1:7] and he proclaimed – “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.[1:8] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

[1:9] Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.[1:10] Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove,[1:11] and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”

[1:12] Immediately afterward the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness;[1:13] and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him.

##### The Work in Galilee #####

[1:14] After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God –[1:15]  “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.” 

[1:16] As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.[1:17]  “Come and follow me,”  Jesus said,  “and I will teach you to fish for people.” [1:18] They left their nets at once, and followed him.

[1:19] Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.[1:20] Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him.

[1:21] They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.[1:22] The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law.[1:23] Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out,[1:24] “What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”[1:25] But Jesus rebuked the spirit,  “Be silent! Come out from him.” [1:26] The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.[1:27] They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, “What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!”[1:28] His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee.

[1:29] As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.[1:30] Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.[1:31] Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them.

[1:32] In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;[1:33] and the whole city was gathered around the door.[1:34] Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.

[1:35] In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, and there he began to pray.[1:36] But Simon and his companions went out searching for him;[1:37] and, when they found him, they exclaimed, “Everyone is looking for you!”[1:38] But Jesus said to them,  “Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.” [1:39] And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons.

[1:40] One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.”[1:41] Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so,  “I am willing; become clean.” [1:42] Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;[1:43] and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him,[1:44]  “Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” [1:45] The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction.

 [Mark 2] 

[2:1] Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;[2:2] and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message.[2:3] Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them.[2:4] Being, however, unable to get him near to Jesus, owing to the crowd, they removed the roofing above Jesus; and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.[2:5] When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  “Child, your sins are forgiven.” 

[2:6] But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were debating in their minds,[2:7] “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?”[2:8] Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them,  “Why are you debating in your minds about this? [2:9]  Which is easier? – to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and take up your mat, and walk’? [2:10]  But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth”  – here he said to the paralyzed man –[2:11]  “To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.” [2:12] The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said, “We have never seen anything like this!”

[2:13] Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.[2:14] As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  “Follow me.”  Levi got up and followed him.

[2:15] Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.[2:16] When the teachers of the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with the tax-gatherers and outcasts?”[2:17] Hearing this, Jesus said,  “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” 

[2:18] Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus, “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?”[2:19] Jesus answered,  “Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. [2:20]  But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then – when that day comes.” 

[2:21]  “No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it – the new from the old – and a worse tear is made. [2:22]  And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.” 

[2:23] One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.[2:24] “Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?”

[2:25]  “Have you never read,”  answered Jesus,  “what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions – [2:26]  how he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?” 

[2:27] Then Jesus added,  “The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath; [2:28]  so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” 

 [Mark 3] 

[3:1] On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.[3:2] And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.[3:3]  “Stand out in the middle,”  Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;[3:4] and to the people he said,  “Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?” [3:5] As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man,  “Stretch out your hand.”  The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.[3:6] Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.

[3:7] Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.[3:8] A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon.[3:9] So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him.[3:10] For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him.[3:11] The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, “You are the Son of God”![3:12] But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known.

[3:13] Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.[3:14] He appointed twelve – whom he also named ‘apostles’ – so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach,[3:15] and with power to drive out demons.[3:16] So he appointed the Twelve – Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),[3:17] James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),[3:18] Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,[3:19] and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him.

[3:20] Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food.[3:21] When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind.

[3:22] The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, “He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.”[3:23] So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables,  “How can Satan drive out Satan? [3:24]  When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last; [3:25]  and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last. [3:26]  So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last – his end has come! 

[3:27]  “No man who has broken into a strong man’s house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house. [3:28]  I tell you that people will be forgiven everything – their sins, and all the slanders that they utter; [3:29]  but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.” [3:30] This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.[3:31] His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.[3:32] There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.”

[3:33]  “Who is my mother? And my brothers?”  was his reply.[3:34] Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said,  “Here are my mother and my brothers! [3:35]  Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” 

 [Mark 4] 


[4:1] Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge.

[4:2] Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them:

[4:3]  “Listen! The sower went out to sow; [4:4]  and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up. [4:5]  Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once; [4:6]  but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. [4:7]  Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return. [4:8]  Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” [4:9] And Jesus said,  “Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.” 

[4:10] Afterward, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;[4:11] and he said,  “To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that – [4:12]  ‘Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.’” 

[4:13]  “You do not know the meaning of this parable?”  he went on,  “Then how will you understand all the other parables? [4:14]  The sower sows the message. [4:15]  The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these – where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them. [4:16]  So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully; [4:17]  but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. [4:18]  Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message, [4:19]  but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. [4:20]  But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” 

[4:21] Jesus said to them,  “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand? [4:22]  There is nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that will not be brought into the open. [4:23]  Let all who have ears to hear with hear. 

[4:24]  “Take care what you listen to,”  said Jesus.  “The standard you use will be used for you, and more will be added for you. [4:25]  For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.” 

[4:26] Jesus also said,  “This is what the kingdom of God is like – like a man who has scattered seed on the ground, [4:27]  and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing – he knows not how. [4:28]  The ground bears the crop of itself – first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear; [4:29]  but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.” 

[4:30] Jesus also said,  “To what can we liken the kingdom of God? [4:31]  By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds, [4:32]  yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.” 

[4:33] With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it;[4:34] and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.

[4:35] In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them,  “Let us go across.” [4:36] So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.[4:37] A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.[4:38] Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?”[4:39] Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,  “Hush! Be still!”  Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.[4:40]  “Why are you so timid?”  he exclaimed.  “Have you no faith yet?” [4:41] But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?”

 [Mark 5] 

[5:1] They came to the other side of the sea – the region of the Gerasenes;[5:2] and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,[5:3] and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;[5:4] for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.[5:5] Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.[5:6] Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,[5:7] shrieking out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!”[5:8] For Jesus had said,  “Come out from the man, you foul spirit.” [5:9] And he asked him,  “What is your name?”  “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;”[5:10] and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.

[5:11] There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;[5:12] and the spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.”[5:13] Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove – about two thousand in number – rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.

[5:14] Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened.[5:15] When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him – and they were awe-struck.[5:16] Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;[5:17] so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.

[5:18] As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.[5:19] But Jesus refused.  “Go back to your home, to your own people,”  he said,  “and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.” [5:20] So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.

[5:21] By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea.[5:22] One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly,[5:23] saying, “My little daughter is at death’s door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.”[5:24] So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him.

[5:25] Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage,[5:26] and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),[5:27] heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.[5:28] “If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!”[5:29] At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction.[5:30] Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said,  “Who touched my clothes?” 

[5:31] “You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say  ‘Who touched me?’” [5:32] But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.[5:33] Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.[5:34]  “Daughter,”  he said,  “your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.” 

[5:35] Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?”[5:36] But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader,  “Do not be afraid; only have faith.” [5:37] And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.[5:38] Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion – people weeping and wailing incessantly.[5:39]  “Why this confusion and weeping?”  he said on entering.  “The little child is not dead; she is asleep.” [5:40] They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.[5:41] Taking her hand, Jesus said to her,  “Talitha, koum!”  – which means  ‘little girl, I am speaking to you – Rise!’ [5:42] The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;[5:43] but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat.

 [Mark 6] 

[6:1] On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country.[6:2] When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing?[6:3] Isn’t he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;[6:4] at which Jesus said,  “A prophet is not without honor, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.” [6:5] And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them;[6:6] and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching.

[6:7] He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.[6:8] He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;[6:9] but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.[6:10]  “Whenever you go to stay at a house,”  he said,  “remain there until you leave that place; [6:11]  and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.” [6:12] So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.[6:13] They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.

[6:14] Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known. People were saying – “John the Baptizer must have risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”[6:15] Others again said – “He is Elijah,” and others – “He is a prophet, like one of the great prophets.”[6:16] But when Herod heard of him, he said – “The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!”

[6:17] For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.[6:18] For John had said to Herod – “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.”[6:19] So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,[6:20] because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him.

[6:21] A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.[6:22] When his daughter – that is, the daughter of Herodias – came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. “Ask me for whatever you like,” the king said to the girl, “and I will give it to you”;[6:23] and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him – up to half his kingdom.[6:24] The girl went out, and said to her mother “What must I ask for?”

“The head of John the Baptizer,” answered her mother.[6:25] So she went in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. “I want you,” she said, “to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.”[6:26] The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.[6:27] He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,[6:28] and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

[6:29] When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb.

[6:30] When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.[6:31]  “Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,”  he said,  “and rest for a while”  – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.[6:32] So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot.[6:33] Many people saw them going, and recognized them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them.[6:34] On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.[6:35] When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.[6:36] Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.”[6:37] But Jesus answered,  “It is for you to give them something to eat.”  “Are we to go and spend almost a year’s wages on bread,” they asked, “to give them to eat?”

[6:38]  “How many loaves have you?”  he asked,  “Go, and see.”  When they had found out, they told him, “Five, and two fish.”[6:39] Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties;[6:40] and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties.[6:41] Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all.[6:42] Everyone had sufficient to eat;[6:43] and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish.[6:44] The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number.

[6:45] Immediately afterward Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.[6:46] After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.[6:47] When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus on the shore alone.[6:48] Seeing them laboring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.[6:49] But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;[6:50] for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them.  “Courage!”  he said,  “it is I; do not be afraid!” [6:51] Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,[6:52] for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.[6:53] When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.[6:54] But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognizing Jesus,[6:55] hurried over the whole country-side, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.[6:56] So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well.

 [Mark 7] 


[7:1] One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.[7:2] They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed.[7:3] (For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors.[7:4] When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans).[7:5] So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question – “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?”[7:6] His answer was,  “It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words – ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me; [7:7]  but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’ [7:8]  You neglect God’s commandments and hold to human traditions. [7:9]  Wisely do you set aside God’s commandments,”  he exclaimed,  “to keep your own traditions! [7:10]  For while Moses said ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,’ [7:11]  you say ‘If a person says to their father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Corban”’  (which means ‘Set apart for God’) –[7:12]  why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother! [7:13]  In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.” 

[7:14] Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said,  “Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words. [7:15]  There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.” [7:16] ^[ 7:16 Some later manuscripts add: Let anyone with ears to hear, listen.]

[7:17] When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying.[7:18]  “What, do even you understand so little?”  exclaimed Jesus.  “Don’t you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them, [7:19]  because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterward got rid of?” – in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean. [7:20]  “It is what comes out from a person,”  he added,  “that defiles them, [7:21]  for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts – sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, [7:22]  greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly; [7:23]  all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.” 

[7:24] On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice.[7:25] For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet –[7:26] the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia – and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.[7:27]  “Let the children be satisfied first,”  answered Jesus.  “For it is not fair to take the children’s food, and throw it to dogs.” 

[7:28] “Yes, Master,” she replied. “Even the dogs under the table do feed on the children’s crumbs.”

[7:29]  “For saying that,”  he answered,  “you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” [7:30] The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone.

[7:31] On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns.[7:32] Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.[7:33] Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man’s ears, and touched his tongue with saliva.[7:34] Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man,  “Ephphatha!”  which means  ‘Be opened.’ [7:35] The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly.[7:36] Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known,[7:37] and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!”

 [Mark 8] 


[8:1] About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,[8:2]  “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; [8:3]  and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.” 

[8:4] “Where will it be possible,” his disciples answered, “to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?”

[8:5]  “How many loaves have you?”  he asked. “Seven,” they answered.[8:6] Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd.[8:7] They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well.[8:8] The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.[8:9] There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.[8:10] Immediately afterward, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha.

[8:11] Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him.[8:12] Sighing deeply, Jesus said,  “Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be given it.” [8:13] So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore.

[8:14] Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat.[8:15] So Jesus gave them this warning.  “Take care,”  he said,  “beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” [8:16] They began talking to one another about their being short of bread;[8:17] and, noticing this, Jesus said to them,  “Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Don’t you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension? [8:18]  Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? Don’t you remember, [8:19]  when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?” 

“Twelve,” they said.[8:20]  “And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?” 

“Seven,” they said.[8:21]  “Don’t you understand now?”  he repeated.

[8:22] They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.[8:23] Taking the blind man’s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man’s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him,  “Do you see anything?” [8:24] The man looked up, and said, “I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.”[8:25] Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man’s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness.[8:26] Jesus sent him to his home, and said,  “Do not go even into the village.” 

[8:27] Afterward Jesus and his disciples went into the villages around Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question –  “Who do people say that I am?” 

[8:28] “John the Baptist,” they answered, “but others say Elijah, while others say one of the prophets.”

[8:29]  “But you,”  he asked,  “who do you say that I am?”  To this Peter replied, “You are the Christ.”[8:30] At which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone.[8:31] Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days.[8:32] He said all this quite openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him.[8:33] Jesus, however, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter.  “Out of my sight, Satan!”  he exclaimed.  “For you look at things, not as God does, but as people do.” 

[8:34] Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said,  “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their cross, and follow me. [8:35]  For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will lose their life will save it. [8:36]  What good is it to a person to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? [8:37]  For what could a person give that is of equal value with their life? [8:38]  Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of them will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.” 

 [Mark 9] 

[9:1]  “I tell you,”  he added,  “that some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in power.” 

[9:2] Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes,[9:3] and his clothes became whiter than any launderer in the whole world could bleach them.[9:4] And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.[9:5] “Rabbi,” said Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”[9:6] For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid.[9:7] Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice – “This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.”[9:8] And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone.

[9:9] As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.[9:10] They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this ‘rising from the dead’ meant.[9:11] “How is it,” they asked Jesus, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?”

[9:12]  “Elijah does indeed come first,”  answered Jesus,  “and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised? [9:13]  But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.” 

[9:14] When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them.[9:15] But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him.[9:16]  “What are you arguing about with them?”  Jesus asked.[9:17] “Teacher,” answered a man in the crowd, “I brought my son to see you, as he has a spirit in him that makes him mute;[9:18] and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.”

[9:19]  “Faithless generation!”  exclaimed Jesus.  “How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.” [9:20] They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.[9:21]  “How long has he been like this?”  Jesus asked the boy’s father.[9:22] “From his childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!”[9:23]  “Why say ‘possibly’?”  Jesus replied.  “Everything is possible for one who has faith.” [9:24] The boy’s father immediately cried out, “I have faith; help my want of faith!”[9:25] But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit,  “Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.” [9:26] With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.[9:27] But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up.

[9:28] When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”

[9:29]  “A spirit of this kind,”  he said,  “can be driven out only by prayer.” 

[9:30] Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it,[9:31] for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them –  “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.” [9:32] But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him.

[9:33] They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them,  “What were you discussing on the way?” [9:34] But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest.[9:35] Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said,  “If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.” [9:36] Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking it in his arms, he said to them,[9:37]  “Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.” 

[9:38] “Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.”

[9:39]  “None of you must prevent the man,”  answered Jesus,  “for no one will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak evil of me. [9:40]  He who is not against us is for us. [9:41]  If anyone gives you a cup of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you, he will assuredly not lose his reward. 

[9:42]  “And, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be far better for him if he had been thrown into the sea with a great millstone around his neck. [9:43]  If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed, than to have both your hands and go into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. [9:44] ^[ 9:44 Some later manuscripts add here or at verse 46: where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.][9:45]  If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life lame, than to have both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna. [9:46] ^[ 9:46 See the note on verse 44.][9:47]  If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into Gehenna, [9:48]  where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out. 

[9:49]  For it is by fire that everyone will be salted. 

[9:50]  Salt is good, but, if the salt should lose its saltiness, what will you use to season it? 

 You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with one another.” 

 [Mark 10] 

##### The Journey to Jerusalem #####

[10:1] On leaving that place, Jesus went into the district of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered about him again; and again, as usual, he began teaching them.[10:2] Presently some Pharisees came up and, to test him, asked, “Has a husband the right to divorce his wife?”

[10:3]  “What direction did Moses give you?”  replied Jesus.[10:4] “Moses,” they said, “permitted a man to draw up in writing a notice of separation and divorce his wife.”

[10:5]  “It was owing to the hardness of your hearts,”  said Jesus,  “that Moses gave you this direction; [10:6]  but, at the beginning of the Creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [10:7]  ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, [10:8]  and the man and his wife will become one;’ so that they are no longer two, but one. [10:9]  What God himself, then, has yoked together no one must separate.” 

[10:10] When they were indoors, the disciples asked him again about this,[10:11] and he said,  “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against his wife; [10:12]  and, if the woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is guilty of adultery.” 

[10:13] Some of the people were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who had brought them.[10:14] When, however, Jesus saw this, he was indignant.  “Let the little children come to me,”  he said,  “do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. [10:15]  I tell you, unless a person receives the kingdom of God like a child, they will not enter it at all.” [10:16] Then he embraced the children, and, placing his hands on them, gave them his blessing.

[10:17] As Jesus was resuming his journey, a man came running up to him, and threw himself on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to gain eternal life?”

[10:18]  “Why do you call me good?”  answered Jesus.  “No one is good but God. [10:19]  You know the commandments – ‘Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not say what is false about others. Do not cheat. Honor your father and your mother.’” 

[10:20] “Teacher,” he replied, “I have observed all these from my childhood.”[10:21] Jesus looked at the man, and his heart went out to him, and he said,  “There is still one thing wanting in you; go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” [10:22] But the man’s face clouded at these words, and he went away distressed, for he had great possessions.

[10:23] Then Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples,  “How hard it will be for people of wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” [10:24] The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again,  “My children, how hard a thing it is to enter the kingdom of God! [10:25]  It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 

[10:26] “Then who can be saved?” they exclaimed in the greatest astonishment.[10:27] Jesus looked at them, and answered,  “With people it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.” 

[10:28] “But we,” began Peter, “we left everything and have followed you.”

[10:29]  “I tell you,”  said Jesus,  “there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake and for the good news, [10:30]  who will not receive a hundred times as much, even now in the present – houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land, though not without persecutions – and in the age that is coming, eternal life. [10:31]  But many who are first now will then be last, and the last will be first.” 

[10:32] They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking in front of them. The disciples were filled with awe, while those who were following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Gathering the Twelve around him once more, Jesus began to tell them what was about to happen to him.[10:33]  “Listen!”  he said.  “We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, and they will give him up to the Gentiles, [10:34]  who will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him, and put him to death; and after three days he will rise again.” 

[10:35] James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”

[10:36]  “What do you want me to do for you?”  he asked.[10:37] “Grant us this,” they answered, “to sit, one on your right, and the other on your left, when you come in glory.”

[10:38]  “You do not know what you are asking,”  Jesus said to them.  “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? Or receive the baptism that I am to receive?” 

[10:39] “Yes,” they answered, “we can.”

 “You will indeed drink the cup that I am to drink,”  Jesus said,  “and receive the baptism that I am to receive, [10:40]  but as to a seat at my right or at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 

[10:41] On hearing of this, the ten others were at first very indignant about James and John.[10:42] But Jesus called the ten to him, and said,  “Those who are regarded as ruling among the Gentiles lord it over them, as you know, and their great men oppress them. [10:43]  But among you it is not so. No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, [10:44]  and whoever wants to take the first place among you must be the servant of all; [10:45]  for even the Son of Man came, not be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 

[10:46] They came to Jericho. When Jesus was going out of the town with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.[10:47] Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to call out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me.”[10:48] Many of the people kept telling him to be quiet; but the man continued to call out all the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me.”[10:49] Then Jesus stopped.  “Call him,”  he said. So they called the blind man. “Have courage!” they exclaimed. “Get up; he is calling you.”[10:50] The man threw off his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.[10:51]  “What do you want me to do for you?”  said Jesus, addressing him. “Rabboni,” the blind man answered, “I want to recover my sight.”

[10:52]  “You may go,”  Jesus said,  “Your faith has delivered you.”  Immediately he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road.

 [Mark 11] 

##### The Last Days #####

[11:1] When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.[11:2]  “Go to the village facing you,”  he said,  “and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it. [11:3]  And, if anyone says to you ‘Why are you doing that?’, say ‘The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.’” [11:4] The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it.[11:5] Some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the foal?”[11:6] And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go.[11:7] Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it.[11:8] Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;[11:9] and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting, “God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord![11:10] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! God save him from on high!”

[11:11] Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.

[11:12] The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;[11:13] and, noticing a fig-tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.[11:14] So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed,  “May no one ever again eat of your fruit!”  And his disciples heard what he said.

[11:15] They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,[11:16] and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the Temple Courts.[11:17] Then he began to teach.  “Does not scripture say,”  he asked,  “‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” [11:18] Now the chief priests and the teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching.[11:19] As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.

[11:20] As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig-tree was withered up from the roots.[11:21] Then Peter recalled what had occurred. “Look, Rabbi,” he exclaimed, “the fig-tree which you doomed is withered up!”

[11:22]  “Have faith in God!”  replied Jesus.[11:23]  “I tell you that if anyone should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be. [11:24]  And therefore I say to you ‘Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.’ 

[11:25]  “And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may forgive you your offenses.” [11:26] ^[ 11:26 Some later manuscripts add: But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your offenses.]

[11:27] They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders came up to him.[11:28] “What authority have you to do these things?” they said. “Who gave you the authority to do them?”

[11:29]  “I will put one question to you,”  said Jesus.  “Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. [11:30]  It is about John’s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.” [11:31] They began arguing together. “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’[11:32] Yet can we say ‘human’?” They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet.[11:33] So their answer to Jesus was – “We do not know.”

 “Then I,”  replied Jesus,  “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.” 

 [Mark 12] 

[12:1] Jesus began to speak to them in parables,  “A man once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. [12:2]  At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of the grape harvest; [12:3]  but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. [12:4]  A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man, too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted. [12:5]  He sent another, but him they killed; and so with many others – some they beat and some they killed. [12:6]  He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent to them last of all. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. [12:7]  But those tenants said to one another ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours.’ [12:8]  So they seized him, and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard. [12:9]  What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let the vineyard to others. 

[12:10]  “Have you never read this passage of scripture? – ‘The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone; [12:11]  this corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’” 

[12:12] After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they left him alone, and went away.

[12:13] Afterward they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation.[12:14] These men came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?[12:15] Should we pay, or should we not pay?” Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them,  “Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin to look at.” [12:16] And, when they had brought it, he asked,  “Whose head and title are these?” 

“The Emperor’s,” they said;[12:17] and Jesus replied,  “Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.”  And they wondered at him.

[12:18] Next came some Sadducees – the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –[12:19] “Teacher, in our scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man’s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.[12:20] There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but died and left no family;[12:21] and the second married his widow, and died without family; and so did the third.[12:22] All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all.[12:23] At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?”

[12:24]  “Is not the reason of your mistake,”  answered Jesus,  “your ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God? [12:25]  When people rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as angels in heaven. 

[12:26]  “As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him saying – ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? [12:27]  He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.” 

[12:28] Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”

[12:29]  “The most important,”  answered Jesus,  “is – ‘Hear, Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord; [12:30]  and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ [12:31]  The second is this – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” 

[12:32] “Wisely answered, teacher!” exclaimed the teacher of the Law. “It is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other besides him;[12:33] and to love him with all one’s heart, and with all one’s understanding, and with all one’s strength, and to love one’s neighbor as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”[12:34] Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him,  “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” 

After that no one ventured to question him further.

[12:35] While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked,  “How is it that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David’s son? [12:36]  David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet.’ [12:37]  David himself calls him ‘lord,’ how comes it, then, that he is to be his son?” 

The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight.[12:38] In the course of his teaching, Jesus said,  “See that you are on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect, [12:39]  and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at dinner. [12:40]  They are the men who rob widows of their homes, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.” 

[12:41] Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums;[12:42] but one poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth very little.[12:43] Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,  “I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests; [12:44]  for everyone else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had – everything that she had to live on.” 

 [Mark 13] 


[13:1] As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!”

[13:2]  “Do you see these great buildings?”  asked Jesus.  “Not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.” 

[13:3] When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately,[13:4] “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its close.”

[13:5] Then Jesus began,  “See that no one leads you astray. [13:6]  Many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He’, and will lead many astray. 

[13:7]  “And, when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must occur; but the end is not yet. [13:8]  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning of the birth-pangs. 

[13:9]  “See to yourselves! They will betray you to courts of law; and you will be taken to synagogues and beaten; and you will be brought up before governors and kings for my sake, so that you can bear witness before them. [13:10]  But the good news must first be proclaimed to every nation. [13:11]  Whenever they betray you and hand you over for trial, do not be anxious beforehand as to what you will say, but say whatever is given you at the moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. [13:12]  Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; [13:13]  and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. 

[13:14]  “As soon, however, as you see ‘the Foul Desecration’ standing where it ought not”  (the reader must consider what this means)  “then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains; [13:15]  and a person on the house-top must not go down, or go in to get anything out of their house: [13:16]  nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get their cloak. [13:17]  And alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [13:18]  Pray, too, that this may not occur in winter. [13:19]  For those days will be a time of distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of God’s creation until now – and never will again. [13:20]  And, had not the Lord put a limit to those days, not a single soul would escape; but, for the sake of God’s own chosen people, he did limit them. 

[13:21]  “And at that time if anyone should say to you ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ ‘Look, there he is!’, do not believe it; [13:22]  for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and display signs and marvels, to lead astray, were it possible, even God’s people. [13:23]  But see that you are on your guard! I have told you all this beforehand. 

[13:24]  “In those days, after that time of distress, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, [13:25]  the stars will be falling from the heavens, and the forces that are in the heavens will be convulsed. [13:26]  Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory; [13:27]  and then he will send the angels, and gather his people from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other. 

[13:28]  “Learn the lesson taught by the fig-tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near. [13:29]  And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that he is at your doors. [13:30]  I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place. [13:31]  The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. 

[13:32]  “But about that day, or the hour, no one knows – not even the angels in heaven, not even the Son – but only the Father. 

[13:33]  “See that you are on the watch; for you do not know when the time will be. [13:34]  It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his home, puts his servants in charge – each having their special duty – and orders the porter to watch. [13:35]  Therefore watch, for you cannot be sure when the Master of the house is coming – whether in the evening, at midnight, at daybreak, or in the morning – [13:36]  otherwise he might come suddenly and find you asleep. [13:37]  And what I say to you I say to all – Watch!” 

 [Mark 14] 


[14:1] It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to death;[14:2] for they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.”

[14:3] When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he was sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured the perfume on his head.[14:4] Some of those who were present said to one another indignantly, “Why has the perfume been wasted like this?[14:5] This perfume could have been sold for more than a year’s wages, and the money given to the poor.”

[14:6]  “Leave her alone,”  said Jesus, as they began to find fault with her,  “why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has done for me. [14:7]  You always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. [14:8]  She has done what she could; she has perfumed my body beforehand for my burial. [14:9]  And I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” 

[14:10] After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them.[14:11] They were glad to hear what he said, and promised to pay him. So he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.

[14:12] On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, when it was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus, “Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the Passover?”[14:13] Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them,  “Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him; [14:14]  and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says – Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’ [14:15]  He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set out ready; and there make preparations for us.” [14:16] So the disciples set out and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them; and they prepared the Passover.

[14:17] In the evening he went there with the Twelve,[14:18] and when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said,  “I tell you that one of you is going to betray me – one who is eating with me.” [14:19] They were grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another, “Can it be I?”

[14:20]  “It is one of you Twelve,”  said Jesus,  “the one who is dipping his bread beside me into the dish. [14:21]  True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” 

[14:22] While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said,  “Take it; this is my body.” [14:23] Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it.[14:24]  “This is my covenant-blood,”  he said,  “which is poured out on behalf of many. [14:25]  I tell you that I will never again drink of the juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God.” 

[14:26] They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,[14:27] presently Jesus said to them,  “All of you will fall away; for scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ [14:28]  Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” 

[14:29] “Even if everyone else falls away,” said Peter, “I will not.”

[14:30]  “I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “that you yourself today – yes, this very night – before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.” [14:31] But Peter vehemently protested, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!” And they all said the same.

[14:32] Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples  “Sit down here while I pray.” [14:33] He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.[14:34]  “I am sad at heart,”  he said,  “sad even to death; wait here, and watch.” [14:35] Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour.[14:36]  “Abba, Father,”  he said,  “all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.” 

[14:37] Then he came and found the three apostles asleep.  “Simon,”  he said to Peter,  “are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch for one hour? [14:38]  Watch and pray,” he said to them all, “so that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” [14:39] Again he went away, and prayed in the same words;[14:40] and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.

[14:41] A third time he came, and said to them,  “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. [14:42]  Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” 

[14:43] And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders.[14:44] Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.”[14:45] As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.[14:46] Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him.

[14:47] One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.[14:48] But Jesus spoke up, and said to the men,  “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? [14:49]  I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfillment of the scriptures.” [14:50] And all the apostles deserted him and fled.[14:51] One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him;[14:52] but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked.

[14:53] Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled.[14:54] Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting there among the police officers, warming himself at the blaze of the fire.

[14:55] Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any;[14:56] for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.[14:57] Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him –[14:58] “We ourselves heard him say ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.’”[14:59] Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree.

[14:60] Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. “Have you no answer to make?” he asked. “What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”[14:61] But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer.

A second time the high priest questioned him. “Are you,” he asked, “the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”

[14:62]  “I am,”  replied Jesus,  “and you will all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” [14:63] At this the high priest tore his vestments. “Why do we want any more witnesses?” he exclaimed.[14:64] “You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?” They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death.

[14:65] Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, “Now play the prophet!” and even the police officers received him with blows.

[14:66] While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up;[14:67] and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!”[14:68] But Peter denied it. “I do not know or understand what you mean,” he replied. Then he went out into the porch;[14:69] and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This is one of them!”[14:70] But Peter again denied it.

Soon afterward the bystanders again said to him, “You certainly are one of them; why you are a Galilean!”[14:71] But he said to them, “I swear that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I am lying!”[14:72] At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him –  ‘Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times’;  and, as he thought of it, he began to weep.

 [Mark 15] 


[15:1] As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with elders and teachers of the Law – that is to say, the whole High Council – put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.[15:2] “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.  “It is true,”  replied Jesus.[15:3] Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.[15:4] So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”[15:5] But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.

[15:6] Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.[15:7] A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot.[15:8] So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,[15:9] he answered, “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”[15:10] For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.[15:11] But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead.[15:12] Pilate, however, spoke to them again, “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?”[15:13] Again they shouted, “Crucify him!”

[15:14] “Why, what harm has he done?” Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously, “Crucify him!”[15:15] And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified.

[15:16] The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard – that is the Government house – and they called the whole garrison together.[15:17] They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him,[15:18] and then began to salute him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.[15:19] And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him – going down on their knees;[15:20] and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.

[15:21] They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross.

[15:22] They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha – a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’[15:23] There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.[15:24] Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take.

[15:25] It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.[15:26] The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read – ‘THE KING OF THE JEWS.’[15:27] And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left.[15:28] ^[ 15:28 Some later manuscripts add: And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted among outlaws.’]

[15:29] The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said, “Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days,[15:30] come down from the cross and save yourself!”[15:31] In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,[15:32] “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.

[15:33] At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.[15:34] And, at three, Jesus called out loudly,  “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?”  which means  ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ [15:35] Some of those standing around heard this, and said, “Listen! He is calling for Elijah!”[15:36] And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”[15:37] But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last.[15:38] The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.[15:39] The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed his last, exclaimed, “This man must indeed have been God’s son!”

[15:40] There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome –[15:41] all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and give him support – besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.

[15:42] The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day – the day before the Sabbath –[15:43] Joseph from Ramah, a councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus.[15:44] But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead;[15:45] and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.[15:46] Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet around him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb.[15:47] Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid.

 [Mark 16] 

##### The Risen Life Announced #####

[16:1] When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint the body of Jesus.[16:2] Very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, after sunrise.[16:3] They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”[16:4] But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one.[16:5] Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them,[16:6] “Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him.[16:7] But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter ‘He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’”[16:8] They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened.

[16:9] After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons.[16:10] She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears;[16:11] yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.[16:12] Afterward, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country.[16:13] They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them.[16:14] Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.[16:15] Then he said to them,  “Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation. [16:16]  He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned. [16:17]  Moreover these signs will attend those who believe. In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; [16:18]  they will take up snakes in their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they will place their hands on sick people and they will recover.” [16:19] So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.[16:20] But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the signs which attended it.

But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

##### Dedication #####

[1:1] To his Excellency, Theophilus.

Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,[1:2] just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterward became bearers of the message.[1:3] And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,[1:4] in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.

##### Birth, Parentage, Infancy and Boyhood #####

[1:5] In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.[1:6] They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.[1:7] But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.

[1:8] One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,[1:9] it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;[1:10] and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.[1:11] And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.[1:12] Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.[1:13] But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.[1:14] He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.[1:15] For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,[1:16] and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.[1:17] He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”

[1:18] “How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”

[1:19] “I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.[1:20] And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.”

[1:21] Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.[1:22] When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.[1:23] And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.[1:24] After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.[1:25] “The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.”

[1:26] Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,[1:27] to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.[1:28] Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, “You have been shown great favor – the Lord is with you.”

[1:29] Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,[1:30] when the angel spoke again, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.[1:31] And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.[1:32] The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,[1:33] and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.”

[1:34] “How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.”

[1:35] “The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’[1:36] And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;[1:37] for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.”

[1:38] “I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary. “Let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her.

[1:39] Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;[1:40] and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.[1:41] When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,[1:42] and cried aloud, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child![1:43] But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?[1:44] For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight![1:45] Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.”

[1:46] And Mary said:

|  “My soul exalts the Lord,
|    [1:47] and my spirit delights in God my Savior,
|  [1:48] for he has looked with favor on his humble servant girl.
|    From now on all generations will call me blessed!

|  [1:49] “For the Almighty has done great things for me,
|    and holy is his name.
|  [1:50] He has mercy on those who revere him
|    in every generation.

|  [1:51] “Mighty are the deeds of his arm;
|    he has scattered the self-satisfied proud,
|  [1:52] he has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
|    and he uplifts the humble,
|  [1:53] he has filled the hungry with good things,
|    and the rich he has sent away empty.

|  [1:54] “He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,
|    ever mindful of his mercy,
|  [1:55] as he promised to our ancestors
|    for Abraham and his descendants for ever.”

[1:56] Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.[1:57] When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son;[1:58] and her neighbors and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.[1:59] A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father,[1:60] when his mother spoke up, “No, he is to be called John.”

[1:61] “You have no relation of that name!” they exclaimed;[1:62] and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.[1:63] Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words – ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised[1:64] and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.[1:65] All their neighbors were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about.[1:66] All who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – “What can this child be destined to become?” For the Power of the Lord was with him.

[1:67] Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:

|  [1:68] “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
|    Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,
|  [1:69] and has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation
|    In the house of his servant David –

|  [1:70] As he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old –
|    [1:71] salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,
|  [1:72] showing mercy to our ancestors,
|    And mindful of his sacred covenant.

|  [1:73] This was the oath which he swore to our ancestor Abraham –
|    [1:74] That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,
|  [1:75] and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,
|    In his presence all our days.

|  [1:76] And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,
|    For you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,
|  [1:77] to give his people the knowledge of salvation
|    In the forgiveness of their sins,

|  [1:78] through the tender mercy of our God,
|    Whereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,
|  [1:79] to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,
|    And guide our feet into the way of peace.”

[1:80] The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.

 [Luke 2] 

[2:1] About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire.[2:2] (This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria).[2:3] And everyone went to his own town to be registered.[2:4] Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea – because he belonged to the family and house of David –[2:5] To be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother.[2:6] While they were there her time came,[2:7] and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger.[2:8] In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,[2:9] when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.[2:10] “Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.[2:11] This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.[2:12] And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.”

[2:13] Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing –

|  [2:14] “glory to God on high,
|    And on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.”

[2:15] Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.”[2:16] So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;[2:17] and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.[2:18] All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,[2:19] while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts.[2:20] And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told.

[2:21] Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus – the name given him by the angel before his conception.

[2:22] When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,[2:23] in compliance with the Law of the Lord that every first-born male will be dedicated to the Lord,[2:24] and also to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord – a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.

[2:25] There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.[2:26] It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.[2:27] Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law,[2:28] Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said:

|  [2:29] “Now, Lord, you will let your servant go,
|    According to your word, in peace,
|  [2:30] for my eyes have seen the salvation
|    [2:31] Which you have prepared in the sight of all nations –
|  [2:32] A light to bring light to the Gentiles,
|    And to be the glory of your people Israel.”

[2:33] While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,[2:34] Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother, “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against –[2:35] Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart – and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.”

[2:36] There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,[2:37] and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.[2:38] At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.

[2:39] When the child’s parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.[2:40] The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him.

[2:41] Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival.[2:42] When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,[2:43] and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it.[2:44] Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances;[2:45] and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.[2:46] It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.[2:47] All who listened to him marveled at his intelligence and his answers.

[2:48] His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him, “My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.”

[2:49]  “What made you search for me?”  he answered.  “Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?” [2:50] His parents did not understand what he meant.[2:51] However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart.[2:52] And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people.

 [Luke 3] 

##### The Preparation #####

[3:1] In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,[3:2] and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.[3:3] And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.[3:4] This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah –

|  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
|  “Make ready the way of the Lord,
|    Make his paths straight.
|  [3:5] Every chasm will be filled,
|    Every mountain and hill will be leveled,
|  The winding ways will be straightened,
|    The rough roads made smooth,
|      [3:6] and everyone will see the salvation of God.”’

[3:7] And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?[3:8] Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham![3:9] Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”

[3:10] “What are we to do then?” the people asked.[3:11] “Let anyone who has two coats,” answered John, “share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.”

[3:12] Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John, “Teacher, what are we to do?”

[3:13] “Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,” John answered.[3:14] And when some soldiers on active service asked “And we – what are we to do?” he said, “Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.”

[3:15] Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,[3:16] John, addressing them all, said, “I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.[3:17] His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”

[3:18] And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people.[3:19] But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,[3:20] crowned them all by shutting John up in prison.

[3:21] Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,[3:22] and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”

[3:23] When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were –

|  Eli,[3:24] Mattith, Levi, Melchiah, Janna, Joseph,[3:25] Mattithiah, Amos, Nahum, Azaliah, Nogah,[3:26] Mattith, Mattithiah, Shimei, Joseph, Josheh,[3:27] Johanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Salathiel, Neriah,[3:28] Melchiah, Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er,[3:29] Joshua, Eliezer, Joram, Mattith, Levi,[3:30] Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim,[3:31] Meleah, Menan, Mattithiah, Nathan, David,[3:32] Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salah, Nahshon,[3:33] Aminadab, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah,[3:34] Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor,[3:35] Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah,[3:36] Kenan, Arpachshad, Shem, Noah, Lamech,[3:37] Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalalel, Kenan,[3:38] Enosh, Seth and Adam the son of God.

 [Luke 4] 

[4:1] On returning from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the power of the Spirit through the wilderness for forty days, tempted by the devil.

[4:2] All that time he ate nothing; and, when it was over, he became hungry.[4:3] So the devil said to him, “If you are God’s Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”[4:4] And Jesus answered him,  “Scripture says – ‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live.’” 

[4:5] And the devil led Jesus up, and showing him in a single moment all the kingdoms of the earth, said to him,[4:6] “I will give you all this power, and the splendor of them; for it has been given into my hands and I give it to whom I wish.[4:7] If you worship me, it will all be yours.”[4:8] And Jesus answered him,  “Scripture says – ‘You should worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” 

[4:9] The devil next led him into Jerusalem, and, placing him on the parapet of the Temple, said, “If you are God’s Son throw yourself down from here,[4:10] for scripture says – ‘He will give his angels commands about you, to guard you safely,’[4:11] And ‘On their hands they will lift you up, otherwise you might strike your foot against a stone.’”[4:12] But Jesus answered him,  “It is said – ‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” 

[4:13] When he had tried every kind of temptation, the devil left Jesus, until another opportunity.

##### The Work in Galilee #####

[4:14] Moved by the power of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee. Reports about him spread through all that region;[4:15] and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was honored by everyone.

[4:16] Coming to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, Jesus, as was his custom, went on the Sabbath into the synagogue, and stood up to read the scriptures.[4:17] He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah; and Jesus opened the book and found the place where it says –
|    [4:18]  ‘The Spirit of the Lord is on me,

|  For he has consecrated me to bring good news to the poor,
|  He has sent me to proclaim release to captives and restoration of sight to the blind,
|    To set the oppressed at liberty, 
|      [4:19]  to proclaim the accepted year of the Lord.’ 

[4:20] Then, closing the book and returning it to the attendant, he sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,[4:21] and Jesus began,

 “This very day this passage has been fulfilled in your hearing.” 

[4:22] All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the beautiful words that fell from his lips. “Isn’t Joseph’s son?” they asked.[4:23]  “Doubtless,”  said Jesus,  “you will remind me of the saying – ‘Doctor, cure yourself;’ and you will say ‘Do here in your own country all that we have heard that has been done at Capernaum.’ [4:24]  I tell you,”  he continued,  “that no prophet is acceptable in his own country. [4:25]  There were, doubtless, many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, and a severe famine prevailed throughout the country; [4:26]  and yet it was not to one of them that Elijah was sent, but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidonia. [4:27]  And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet it was not one of them who was made clean, but Naaman the Syrian.” [4:28] All the people in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged.[4:29] Starting up, they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town stood, intending to hurl him down.[4:30] But he passed through the middle of the crowd and went on his way.

[4:31] Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the Sabbath he taught the people.[4:32] They were amazed at his teaching, because his words were spoken with authority.[4:33] In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly,[4:34] “Stop! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”[4:35] But Jesus rebuked the demon.  “Be silent! Come out from him,”  he said. The demon flung the man down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without causing him further harm.[4:36] And they were all lost in amazement, and kept saying to one another, “What words are these? For he gives his commands to the foul spirits with a marvelous authority, and they come out.”[4:37] And rumors about Jesus traveled through every place in the region.

[4:38] On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and they asked Jesus to cure her.[4:39] Bending over her, he rebuked the fever; the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of them.[4:40] At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and cured them.[4:41] And even demons came out from many people, screaming ‘You are the Son of God.’ Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

[4:42] At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried to detain him and prevent his leaving them.[4:43] Jesus, however, said to them,  “I must take the good news of the kingdom of God to the other town also, for that was why I was sent.” [4:44] And he continued to make his proclamation in the synagogues of Judea.

 [Luke 5] 


[5:1] Once, when the people were pressing around Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore.[5:2] The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets.[5:3] So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.[5:4] When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,  “Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.” 

[5:5] “We have been hard at work all night, Sir,” answered Simon, “and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.”[5:6] They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.[5:7] So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.[5:8] When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming, “Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!”[5:9] For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made;[5:10] and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners.  “Do not be afraid,”  Jesus said to Simon,  “from today you will catch people.” [5:11] And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him.

[5:12] On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”[5:13] Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so,  “I am willing; become clean.” 

Instantly the leprosy left the man;[5:14] and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone,  “but,”  he added,  “set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” [5:15] However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;[5:16] but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray.

[5:17] On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.)[5:18] And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus;[5:19] but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus.[5:20] When he saw their faith, Jesus said,  “Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.” [5:21] The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this. “Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins except God?”

[5:22] When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed,  “What are you debating with yourselves? [5:23]  Which is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins have been forgiven you’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’? [5:24]  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”  – he spoke to the paralyzed man –  “To you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.” [5:25] Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God.[5:26] The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, “We have seen marvelous things today!”

[5:27] After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  “Follow me.” [5:28] Levi left everything and got up and followed him.[5:29] And Levi gave a great entertainment at his house, in honor of Jesus; and a large number of tax-gatherers and others were having dinner with them.

[5:30] The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus.[5:31] In answer Jesus said,  “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill. [5:32]  I have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.” 

[5:33] “John’s disciples,” they said to Jesus, “Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!”

[5:34] But Jesus answered them,  “Can you make the groom’s friends fast while the groom is with them? [5:35]  But the days will come – a time when the groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those days come.” [5:36] Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them,  “No one ever tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new one will not match the old. [5:37]  And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine itself will run out, and the skins be lost. [5:38]  But new wine must be put into fresh skins. [5:39]  No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. ‘No,’ they say, ‘the old is excellent.’” 

 [Luke 6] 

[6:1] One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.[6:2] “Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?” asked some of the Pharisees.[6:3] Jesus’ answer was,  “Haven’t you read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions – [6:4]  That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are allowed to eat it?” [6:5] Then Jesus added,  “The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” 

[6:6] On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.[6:7] The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him.[6:8] Jesus, however, knew what was in the their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered,  “Stand up and come out into the middle.”  The man stood up;[6:9] and Jesus said to them,  “I ask you, is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?” [6:10] Then, looking around at them all, he said to the man,  “Stretch out your hand.”  The man did so; and his hand had become sound.[6:11] But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus.

[6:12] Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God.[6:13] When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named ‘apostles.’[6:14] They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,[6:15] Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot,[6:16] Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.[6:17] Afterward Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon,[6:18] who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured;[6:19] and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all.

[6:20] Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said:

|   “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. 
|  [6:21]  Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.
|  Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. 
|  [6:22]  Blessed are you when people hate you,
|    and when they expel you from among them,
|    and insult you,
|    and reject your name as an evil thing –
|  because of the Son of Man. 

|  [6:23]  Then indeed you may be glad and dance for joy, for be sure that your reward in heaven will be great; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets. [6:24]  But

|  alas for you who are rich,
|    for you have had your comforts in full. 
|  [6:25]  Alas for you who are sated now,
|    for you will hunger.
|  Alas for you who laugh now,
|    for you will mourn and weep. 
|  [6:26]  Alas for you when everyone speaks well of you;
|    for this is what their ancestors did to the false prophets. 

|  [6:27]  But to you who hear I say – love your enemies, show kindness to those who hate you, [6:28]  bless those who curse you, pray for those who insult you. [6:29]  When someone gives one of you a blow on the cheek, offer the other cheek as well; and, when anyone takes away your cloak, do not keep back your coat either. [6:30]  Give to everyone who asks of you; and, when anyone takes away what is yours, do not demand its return. [6:31]  Do to others as you wish them to do to you. 

|  [6:32]  If you love only those who love you, what thanks will be due to you? Why, even the outcast love those who love them! [6:33]  For, if you show kindness only to those who show kindness to you, what thanks will be due to you? Even the outcast do that! [6:34]  If you lend only to those from whom you expect to get something, what thanks will be due to you? Even the outcast lend to the outcast in the hope of getting as much in return! [6:35]  But love your enemies, and show them kindness, and lend to them, never despairing. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the thankless and the bad. 

|  [6:36]  Learn to be merciful – even as your Father is merciful. [6:37]  Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. [6:38]  Give, and others will give to you. A generous measure, pressed and shaken down, and running over, will they pour into your lap; For The standard you use will be the standard used for you.” 

[6:39]  Then, speaking in parables, Jesus said, “Can one blind person guide another? Will they not both fall into a ditch? [6:40]  A student is not above their teacher; yet every finished student will be like their teacher. [6:41]  And why do you look at the speck of sawdust in someone’s eye, while you pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in your own? [6:42]  How can you say to your friend ‘Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ while you yourself do not see the plank in your own? Hypocrite! Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly how to take out the speck in your friend’s. [6:43]  There is no such thing as a good tree bearing worthless fruit, or, on the other hand, a worthless tree bearing good fruit. [6:44]  For every tree is known by its own fruit. People do not gather figs off thorn bushes, nor pick a bunch of grapes off a bramble. [6:45]  A good person, from the good stores of their heart, brings out what is good; while a bad person, from their bad stores, brings out what is bad. For what fills someone’s heart will rise to their lips. [6:46]  Why do you call me ‘Master! Master!’ and yet fail to do what I tell you? [6:47]  Everyone who comes to me and listens to my teaching and acts on it – I will show you to whom they may be compared. [6:48]  They may be compared to a person building a house, who dug, and went deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. Then, when a flood came, the river swept down on that house, but had no power to shake it, because it had been built well. [6:49]  But those who have listened and not acted on what they have heard may be compared to a person who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The river swept down on it, and the house immediately collapsed; and great was the crash that followed.” 

 [Luke 7] 

[7:1] When Jesus had brought to a conclusion all that he had then had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum.

[7:2] A captain in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who was seriously ill – almost at the point of death.[7:3] And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave’s life.[7:4] When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to do so. “He deserves the favor from you,” they said,[7:5] “For he is devoted to our nation, and himself built our synagogue for us.”[7:6] So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the captain sent some friends with the message – “Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof.[7:7] That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured.[7:8] For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”[7:9] Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the crowd which was following him, he said,  “I tell you, nowhere in Israel have I met with such faith as this!” [7:10] And, when the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave recovered.

[7:11] Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and a great crowd going with him.[7:12] Just as he approached the gate of the town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial – an only son, and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town were with her.[7:13] When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her,  “Do not weep.” [7:14] Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said,  “Young man, I am speaking to you – Rise!” [7:15] The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother.[7:16] Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. “A great prophet has arisen among us,” they said. “God has visited his people.”

[7:17] And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the neighboring countries as well.

[7:18] All these events were reported to John by his disciples.[7:19] So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?”

[7:20] When these men found Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for somebody else?”[7:21] At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight.[7:22] So his answer to the question was,  “Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard – the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. [7:23]  And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.” 

[7:24] When John’s messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John,[7:25]  “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. [7:26]  What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. [7:27]  This is the man of whom scripture says –

|  ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
|    and he will prepare your way before you.’ 

[7:28]  There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” 

[7:29] (All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John’s baptism, acknowledged the justice of God.[7:30] But the Pharisees and the students of the Law, having rejected John’s baptism, frustrated God’s purpose in regard to them.)

[7:31]  “To what then,”  Jesus continued,  “should I compare the people of the present generation? What are they like? [7:32]  They are like some little children who are sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another – ‘We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not wept!’ [7:33]  For now that John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking wine, you are saying ‘He has a demon in him’; [7:34]  and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, you are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts.’ [7:35]  And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” 

[7:36] One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to his house and took his place at the table.[7:37] Just then a woman, who was an outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume,[7:38] and placed herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head, repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume.

[7:39] When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “Had this man been ‘the prophet,’ he would have known who, and what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an outcast.”[7:40] But, addressing him, Jesus said,  “Simon, I have something to say to you.” 

“Pray do so, teacher,” Simon answered; and Jesus began,[7:41]  “There were two people who were in debt to a moneylender; one owed five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty. [7:42]  As they were unable to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, do you think, will love him the more?” 

[7:43] “I suppose,” answered Simon, “it will be the man to whom he forgave the greater debt.”

 “You are right,”  said Jesus,[7:44] and then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon,  “Do you see this woman? I came into your house – you gave me no water for my feet, but she has made my feet wet with her tears and dried them with her hair. [7:45]  You did not give me one kiss, but she, from the moment I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. [7:46]  You did not anoint even my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. [7:47]  So I tell you, her great love shows that her sins, many as they are, have been pardoned. One who is pardoned little loves little.” [7:48] Then he said to the woman,  “Your sins have been pardoned.” [7:49] The other guests began to say to one another, “Who is this man who even pardons sins?”[7:50] But Jesus said to the woman,  “Your faith has delivered you; go, and peace be with you.” 

 [Luke 8] 


[8:1] Shortly afterward, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve,[8:2] as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom seven demons had been expelled),[8:3] and Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others – all of whom provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources.

[8:4] Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of a parable,[8:5]  “The sower went out to sow his seed; and, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path and was trodden on; and the wild birds ate it up. [8:6]  Other seed fell on rock, and, as soon as it began to grow, because it had no moisture, it withered away. [8:7]  Other seed fell in the middle of brambles, but the brambles grew up with it and choked it entirely. [8:8]  Other seed fell into rich soil, and grew, and gave a hundredfold return.”  After saying this, Jesus cried aloud,  “Let those who have ears to hear with hear.” 

[8:9] His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable.[8:10]  “To you,”  he said,  “the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of God has been imparted, but to others in parables only, so that though they have eyes they may not see, and though they have ears, they may not understand. [8:11]  This is the parable – The seed is God’s message. [8:12]  By the seed which fell along the path are meant those who hear the message; but then comes the devil and carries away the message from their minds, to prevent their believing it and being saved. [8:13]  By the seed which fell on the rock are meant those who, as soon as they hear the message, welcome it joyfully; but they have no root, and believe it only for a time, and, when the time of temptation comes, they draw back. [8:14]  By that which fell among the brambles are meant those who hear the message, but who, as they go on their way, are completely choked by this world’s cares and wealth and pleasures, and bring nothing to perfection. [8:15]  But by that in the good ground are meant those who, having heard the message, keep it in the good, rich soil of their hearts, and patiently yield a return. 

[8:16]  “No one sets light to a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it underneath a couch, but they put it on a lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light. [8:17]  Nothing is hidden which will not be brought into the light of day, not ever kept hidden which will not some day become known and come into the light of day. [8:18]  Take care, then, how you listen. For, to all those who have, more will be given; while, from all those who have nothing, even what they seem to have will be taken away.” 

[8:19] Presently Jesus’ mother and brothers came where he was, but they were not able to join him because of the crowd.[8:20] So word was brought to him – ‘Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.’[8:21] His reply, spoken to them all, was,  “My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and do what it says.” 

[8:22] One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them,  “Let us go across the lake.” [8:23] So they put off. While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake, and their boat was filling and they were in danger.[8:24] So the disciples came and roused him. “Sir, Sir,” they cried, “we are lost!” Jesus rose and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm followed.[8:25]  “Where is your faith?”  he exclaimed. But in great awe and amazement they said to one another, “Who can this be, who commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him?”

[8:26] And they reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee;[8:27] and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.[8:28] Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.”[8:29] For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the Wilds.

[8:30]  “What is your name?”  Jesus asked.

“Legion,” he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him);[8:31] and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit.[8:32] There was a drove of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave.[8:33] They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the drove rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.[8:34] When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around.[8:35] The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck.[8:36] Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered.[8:37] Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned.[8:38] The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away.[8:39]  “Go back to your home,”  he said,  “and relate the story of all that God has done for you.” So the man went through the whole town and proclaimed, as he went, all that Jesus had done for him. 

[8:40] On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him.[8:41] And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house,[8:42] because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely around him.[8:43] And a woman, who had suffered from hemorrhage for twelve years, and whom no one could cure,[8:44] came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the hemorrhage ceased.

[8:45]  “Who touched me?”  Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed, “Why, Sir, the people are crowding around you and pressing against you!”

[8:46]  “Somebody touched me,”  said Jesus,  “for I felt that power had gone out from me.” [8:47] Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him, and that she had been cured instantly.

[8:48]  “Daughter,”  he said,  “your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you.” 

[8:49] Before he had finished speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, “Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the teacher further.”[8:50] But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader,  “Do not be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.” [8:51] When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.[8:52] And everyone was weeping and mourning for her.

 “Do not weep,”  Jesus said,  “she is not dead; she is asleep.” [8:53] They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead.[8:54] But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice,  “Child, rise!” [8:55] The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat.[8:56] Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened.

 [Luke 9] 


[9:1] Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases.[9:2] He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures.[9:3]  “Do not,”  he said to them,  “take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you. [9:4]  Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place. [9:5]  If people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protest against them.” [9:6] Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the good news and curing people everywhere.

[9:7] Prince Herod heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.[9:8] Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again.[9:9] But Herod himself said, “John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?” And he endeavored to see him.

[9:10] When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him.[9:11] But the people recognized him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.[9:12] The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, “Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms around about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.”[9:13] But Jesus said,  “It is for you to give them something to eat.” 

“We have not more than five loaves and two fish,” they answered. “Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.”[9:14] (For the men among them were about five thousand.)  “Get them seated in companies,”  was his reply,  “about fifty in each.” [9:15] This they did, and got all the people seated.[9:16] Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.[9:17] Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up – twelve baskets.

[9:18] Afterward, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question –  “Who do the people say that I am?” 

[9:19] “John the Baptist,” was their answer. “Others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.”

[9:20]  “But you,”  he went on,  “who do you say that I am?”  And to this Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”

[9:21] Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone;[9:22] he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.[9:23] And to all present he said,  “If any one wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross daily, and follow me. [9:24]  For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life – that person will save it. [9:25]  What good does it do someone if, when they has gained the whole world, they has lost or forfeited themselves? [9:26]  Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them, when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels. [9:27]  Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will not know death, until they have seen the kingdom of God.” 

[9:28] About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.[9:29] As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became of a glittering whiteness.[9:30] And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,[9:31] who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.[9:32] Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him.

[9:33] And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed, “Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what he was saying;[9:34] and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;[9:35] and from the cloud came a voice which said – “This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.”[9:36] And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen.

[9:37] The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.[9:38] And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, “Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;[9:39] all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.[9:40] I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.”

[9:41]  “Faithless and perverse generation!”  Jesus exclaimed,  “How long must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.” [9:42] While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.[9:43] And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God.

In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,[9:44]  “Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.” [9:45] But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant.

[9:46] A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;[9:47] and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,[9:48] and then said to them,  “Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among you all – that person is great.” 

[9:49] John said, “Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.”

[9:50]  “None of you must prevent him,”  Jesus said to John,  “whoever’s not against you is for you.” 

##### The Journey to Jerusalem #####

[9:51] As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance.[9:52] On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,[9:53] but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.[9:54] When James and John saw this, they said, “Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?”[9:55] But Jesus turned and rebuked them.[9:56]  And they made their way to another village. 

[9:57] And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.”

[9:58]  “Foxes have holes,”  he replied,  “and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” [9:59] To another man Jesus said,  “Follow me.” 

“Let me first go and bury my father,” said the man.[9:60] But Jesus said,  “Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and wide the news of the kingdom of God.” 

[9:61] “Master,” said another, “I will follow you; but first let me say goodbye to my family.”[9:62] But Jesus answered,  “No one who looks back, after putting their hand to the plow, is fitted for the kingdom of God.” 

 [Luke 10] 


[10:1] After this, the Master appointed seventy-two other disciples, and sent them on as his messengers, two and two, in advance, to every town and place that he was himself intending to visit.

[10:2]  “The harvest,”  he said,  “is abundant, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send laborers to gather in his harvest. [10:3]  Now, go. Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like lambs among wolves. [10:4]  Do not take a purse with you, or a bag, or sandals; and do not stop to greet anyone on your journey. [10:5]  Whatever house you go to stay at, begin by praying for a blessing on it. [10:6]  Then, if anyone there is deserving of a blessing, your blessing will rest on him; but if not, it will come back on yourselves. [10:7]  Remain at that same house, and eat and drink whatever they offer you; for the worker is worth their wages. Do not keep changing from one house to another. [10:8]  Whatever town you visit, if the people welcome you, eat what is set before you; [10:9]  cure the sick there, and tell people that the kingdom of God is close at hand. [10:10]  But, whatever town you go to visit, if the people do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say [10:11]  ‘We wipe off the dust of your town which has clung to Our feet; still, be assured that the kingdom of God is close at Hand.’ [10:12]  I tell you that the doom of Sodom will be more bearable on that day than the doom of that town. [10:13]  Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the Miracles which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes and repented long ago. [10:14]  Yet the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable at the judgment than yours. [10:15]  And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades. [10:16]  Anyone who listens to you is listening to me, and anyone who rejects you is rejecting me; while the person who rejects me is rejecting him who sent me as his messenger.” 

[10:17] When the seventy-two returned, they exclaimed joyfully, “Master, even the demons submit to us when we use your name.”[10:18] And Jesus replied,  “I have had visions of Satan, fallen, like lightning from the heavens. [10:19]  Remember, I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to meet all the strength of the Enemy. Nothing will ever harm you in any way. [10:20]  Yet do not rejoice in the fact that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names have been enrolled in heaven.” 

[10:21] At that same time, moved to exultation by the Holy Spirit, Jesus said:

|   “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike! Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you. 

|  [10:22]  Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone know who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.” 

[10:23] Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said to them alone,  “Blessed are the eyes that see what you are seeing; [10:24]  for, I tell you, many prophets and kings wished for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never heard them.” 

[10:25] Just then a Student of the Law came forward to test Jesus further. “Teacher,” he said, “what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?”

[10:26]  “What is said in the Law?”  answered Jesus.  “What do you read there?” [10:27] His reply was –

|  “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as you love yourself.”

[10:28]  “You have answered right,”  said Jesus,  “Do that, and you will live.” [10:29] But the man, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”

[10:30] To which Jesus replied,  “A man was once going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him of everything, and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead. [10:31]  As it chanced, a priest was going down by that road. He saw the man, but passed by on the opposite side. [10:32]  A Levite, too, did the same; he came up to the spot, but, when he saw the man, passed by on the opposite side. [10:33]  But a Samaritan, traveling that way, came upon the man, and, when he saw him, he was moved with compassion. [10:34]  He went to him and bound up his wounds, dressing them with oil and wine, and then put him on his own mule, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. [10:35]  The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and whatever more you may spend I will myself repay you on my way back.’ [10:36]  Now which, do you think, of these three men,” asked Jesus, “proved himself a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?” 

[10:37] “The one that took pity on him,” was the answer; at which Jesus said,  “Go and do the same yourself.” 

[10:38] As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house.[10:39] She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Master’s feet, and listened to his teaching;[10:40] but Martha was distracted by the many preparations that she was making. So she went up to Jesus and said, “Master, do you approve of my sister’s leaving me to make preparations alone? Tell her to help me.”

[10:41]  “Martha, Martha,”  replied the Master,  “you are anxious and trouble yourself about many things; [10:42]  but only a few are necessary, or rather one. Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken away from her.” 

 [Luke 11] 

[11:1] One day Jesus was at a certain place praying, and, when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”

[11:2]  “When you pray,”  Jesus answered,  “say –

|  ‘Father,
|    May your name be held holy,
|    your kingdom come. 
|  [11:3]  Give us each day the bread that we will need; 
|  [11:4]  and forgive us our sins,
|  for we ourselves forgive everyone who wrongs us;
|  and take us not into temptation.’” 

[11:5] Jesus also said to them,  “Suppose that one of you who has a friend were to go to him in the middle of the night and say ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, [11:6]  for a friend of mine has arrived at my house after a journey, and I have nothing to offer him;’ [11:7]  And suppose that the other should answer from inside ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already fastened, and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything’; [11:8]  I tell you that, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is a friend, yet because of his persistence he will rouse himself and give him what he wants. 

[11:9]  “And so I say to you – Ask, and your prayer will be granted, search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. [11:10]  For the person who asks receives, everyone who searches finds, and to the person who knocks the door will be opened. [11:11]  What father among you, if his son asks him for a fish, will give him a snake instead, [11:12]  or, if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [11:13]  If you, then, naturally wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” 

[11:14] Once Jesus was driving out a dumb demon, and, when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke. The people were amazed at this;[11:15] but some of them said, “He drives out demons by the help of Beelzebul, the chief of the demons”;[11:16] while others, to test him, asked him for some sign from the heavens.[11:17] Jesus himself, however, was aware of what they were thinking, and said to them,  “Any kingdom wholly divided against itself becomes a desolation; and a divided house falls. [11:18]  So, too, if Satan is wholly divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I drive out demons by the help of Beelzebul. [11:19]  But, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges. [11:20]  But, if it is by the hand of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. [11:21]  When a strong man is keeping guard, fully armed, over his own mansion, his property is in safety; [11:22]  but, when one still stronger has attacked and overpowered him, he takes away all the weapons on which the other had relied, and divides his spoil. [11:23]  Whoever who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering. [11:24]  No sooner does a foul spirit leave someone, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest; and finding none, it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’; [11:25]  but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order. [11:26]  Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that person proves to be worse than the first.” [11:27] As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd, raising her voice, exclaimed, “Happy was the mother who bore you and nursed you!”[11:28] But Jesus replied,  “Rather, happy are those who listen to God’s message and keep it.” 

[11:29] As the crowds increased, Jesus began to speak,  “This generation is a wicked generation. It is asking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah. [11:30]  For, as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [11:31]  At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the people of this generation, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! [11:32]  At the judgment the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! [11:33]  No one sets light to a lamp, and then puts it in the cellar or under a basket, but he puts it on the lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light. [11:34]  The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body, also, is lit up; but, as soon as your eye is diseased, your body, also, is darkened. [11:35]  Take care, therefore, that the inner light is not darkness. [11:36]  If, then, your whole body is lit up, and no corner of it darkened, the whole will be lit up, just as when a lamp gives you light by its brilliance.” 

[11:37] As Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to breakfast with him, and Jesus went in and took his place at the table.[11:38] The Pharisee noticed, to his astonishment, that Jesus omitted the ceremonial washing before breakfast.[11:39] But the Master said to him,  “You Pharisees do, it is true, clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are filled with greed and wickedness. [11:40]  Fools! Did not the maker of the outside make the inside too? [11:41]  Only give away what is in them in charity, and at once you have the whole clean. [11:42]  But alas for you Pharisees! You pay tithes on mint, rue, and herbs of all kinds, and pass over justice and love to God. These last you ought to have put into practice without neglecting the first. [11:43]  Alas for you Pharisees! You delight to have the front seat in the synagogues, and to be greeted in the markets with respect. [11:44]  Alas for you! You are like unsuspected graves, over which men walk unawares.” 

[11:45] Here one of the students of the Law interrupted him by saying, “Teacher, when you say this, you are insulting us also.”[11:46] But Jesus went on,  “Alas for you, too, you students of the Law! You load people with loads that are too heavy to carry, but do not, yourselves, touch them with one of your fingers. [11:47]  Alas for you! You build the monuments of the prophets whom your ancestors killed. [11:48]  You are actually witnesses to your ancestors’ acts and show your approval of them, because, while they killed the prophets, you build tombs for them. [11:49]  That is why the wisdom of God said – ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, [11:50]  some of whom they will persecute and kill, in order that the blood of all the prophets that has been spilt since the creation of the world may be exacted from this generation – [11:51]  from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house of God.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be exacted from this generation. [11:52]  Alas for you students of the Law! You have taken away the key of the door of knowledge. You have not gone in yourselves and you have hindered those who try to go in.” 

[11:53] When Jesus left the house, the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began to press him hard and question him closely on many subjects,[11:54] laying traps for him, so as to seize on anything that he might say.

 [Luke 12] 


[12:1] Meanwhile the people had gathered in thousands, so that they trod on one another, when Jesus, addressing himself to his disciples, began by saying to them,  “Be on your guard against the leaven – that is, the hypocrisy – of the Pharisees. [12:2]  There is nothing, however covered up, which will not be uncovered, nor anything kept secret which will not become known. [12:3]  So all that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear, within closed doors, will be proclaimed on the housetops. [12:4]  To you who are my friends I say, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but after that can do no more. [12:5]  I will show you of whom you should be afraid. Be afraid of him who, after killing you, has the power to fling you into Gehenna. Yes, I say, be afraid of him. [12:6]  Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not one of them has escaped God’s notice. [12:7]  No, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. [12:8]  Everyone, I tell you, who publicly acknowledges me, the Son of Man, also, will acknowledge before God’s angels; [12:9]  but the person who publicly disowns me will be altogether disowned before God’s angels. [12:10]  Everyone who will say anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but for the person who slanders the Holy Spirit there will be no forgiveness. [12:11]  Whenever they take you before the synagogue Courts or the magistrates or other authorities, do not be anxious as to how you will defend yourselves, or what your defense will be, or what you will say; [12:12]  for the Holy Spirit will show you at the moment what you ought to say.” 

[12:13] “Teacher,” a man in the crowd said to Jesus, “tell my brother to share the property with me.”[12:14] But Jesus said to him,  “Man, who made me a judge or an arbiter between you?” [12:15] And then he added,  “Take care to keep yourselves free from every form of covetousness; for even in the height of their prosperity a person’s true life does not depend on what they have.” 

[12:16] Then Jesus told them this parable –  “There was once a rich man whose land was very fertile; [12:17]  and he began to ask himself ‘What will I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops? [12:18]  This is what I will do,’ he said; ‘I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them; [12:19]  and I will say to myself, Now you have plenty of good things put by for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.’ [12:20]  But God said to the man ‘Fool! This very night your life is being demanded; and as for all you have prepared – who will have it?’ [12:21]  So it is with those who lay by wealth for themselves and are not rich to the glory of God.” 

[12:22] And Jesus said to his disciples,  “That is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about the life here – what you can get to eat; or about your body – what you can get to wear. [12:23]  For life is more than food, and the body than its clothes. [12:24]  Think of the ravens – they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God feeds them! And how much more precious are you than birds! [12:25]  But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong your life a moment? [12:26]  And, if you cannot do even the smallest thing, why be anxious about other things? [12:27]  Think of the lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet, I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendor was not robed like one of these. [12:28]  If, even in the field, God so clothes the grass which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith! [12:29]  And you – do not be always seeking what you can get to eat or what you can get to drink; and do not waver. [12:30]  These are the things for which all the nations of the world are seeking, and your Father knows that you need them. [12:31]  No, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added for you. [12:32]  So do not be afraid, my little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 

[12:33]  “Sell what belongs to you, and give in charity. Make yourselves purses that will not wear out – an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, or moth works ruin. [12:34]  For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. [12:35]  Make yourselves ready, with your lamps alight; [12:36]  and be like servants who are waiting for their Master’s return from his wedding, so that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door for him at once. [12:37]  Happy are those servants whom, on his return, the Master will find watching. I tell you that he will make himself ready, and have them take their places at the table, and will come and serve them. [12:38]  Whether it is late at night, or in the early morning that he comes, if he finds all as it should be, then happy are they. [12:39]  This you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch, and would not have let his house be broken into. [12:40]  You must also prepare, for when you are least expecting him the Son of Man will come.” 

[12:41] “Master,” said Peter, “are you telling this parable with reference to us or to everyone?”

[12:42]  “Who, then,”  replied the Master,  “is that trustworthy steward, the careful man, who will be placed by his master over his establishment, to give them their rations at the proper time? [12:43]  Happy will that servant be whom his master, when he comes home, will find doing this. [12:44]  His master, I tell you, will put him in charge of the whole of his property. [12:45]  But should that servant say to himself ‘My master is a long time coming,’ and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, [12:46]  that servant’s master will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour of which he is unaware, and will flog him severely and assign him his place among the untrustworthy. [12:47]  The servant who knows his master’s wishes and yet does not prepare and act accordingly will receive many lashes; [12:48]  while one who does not know his master’s wishes, but acts so as to deserve a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone to whom much has been given much will be expected, and from the man to whom much has been entrusted the more will be demanded. [12:49]  I came to cast fire on the earth; and what more can I wish, if it is already kindled? [12:50]  There is a baptism that I must undergo, and how great is my distress until it is over! [12:51]  Do you think that I am here to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but to cause division. [12:52]  For from this time, if there are five people in a house, they will be divided, three against two, and two against three. [12:53]  Father will be opposed to son and son to father, mother to daughter and daughter to mother, mother-in-law to her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law.” 

[12:54] And to the people Jesus said,  “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once ‘There is a storm coming,’ and come it does. [12:55]  And when you see that the wind is in the south, you say ‘It will be burning hot,’ and so it proves. [12:56]  Hypocrites! You know how to judge of the earth and the sky; how is it, then, that you cannot judge of this time? [12:57]  Why don’t you yourselves decide what is right? [12:58]  When, for instance, you are going with your opponent before a magistrate, on your way to the court do your best to be quit of him; otherwise he might drag you before the judge, then the judge will hand you over to the bailiff of the court, and the bailiff throw you into prison. [12:59]  You will not, I tell you, come out until you have paid the very last cent.” 

 [Luke 13] 

[13:1] Just at that time some people had come to tell Jesus about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.[13:2]  “Do you suppose,”  replied Jesus,  “that, because these Galileans have suffered in this way, they were worse sinners than any other Galileans? [13:3]  No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. [13:4]  Or those eighteen men at Siloam on whom the tower fell, killing them all, do you suppose that they were worse offenders than any other inhabitants of Jerusalem? [13:5]  No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same manner.” 

[13:6] And Jesus told them this parable –  “A man, who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, came to look for fruit on it, but could not find any. [13:7]  So he said to his gardener ‘Three years now I have come to look for fruit on this fig tree, without finding any! Cut it down. Why should it rob the soil?’ [13:8]  ‘Leave it this one year more, Sir,’ the man answered, ‘until I have dug around it and manured it. [13:9]  Then, if it bears in future, well and good; but if not, you can have it cut down.’” 

[13:10] Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the synagogues,[13:11] and he saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was wholly unable to raise herself.[13:12] When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said,  “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” [13:13] He placed his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to praise God.[13:14] But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people, “There are six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of those, and not on the Sabbath.”

[13:15]  “You hypocrites!”  the Master answered him.  “Does not everyone of you let your ox or your ass loose from its manger, and take it out to drink, on the Sabbath? [13:16]  But this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has been kept in bondage by Satan for now eighteen years, ought not she to have been released from her bondage on the Sabbath?” [13:17] As he said this, his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all the wonderful things that he was doing.

[13:18] So Jesus said,  “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what can I liken it? [13:19]  It is like a mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden. The seed grew and became a tree, and the wild birds roosted in its branches.” [13:20] And again Jesus said,  “To what can I liken the kingdom of God? [13:21]  It is like some yeast which a woman took and covered in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.” 

[13:22] Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and making his way towards Jerusalem.[13:23] “Master,” someone asked, “are there but few in the path of salvation?” And Jesus answered,[13:24]  “Strive to go in by the small door. Many, I tell you, will seek to go in, but they will not be able, [13:25]  when once the master of the house has got up and shut the door, while you begin to say, as you stand outside and knock, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ His answer will be – ‘I do not know where you come from.’ [13:26]  Then you will begin to say ‘We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets,’ and his reply will be – [13:27]  ‘I do not know where you come from. Leave my presence, all you who are living in wickedness.’ [13:28]  There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are being driven outside. [13:29]  People will come from East and West, and from North and South, and take their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God. [13:30]  There are some who are last now who will then be first, and some who are first now who will then be last!” 

[13:31] Just then some Pharisees came up to Jesus and said, “Go away and leave this place, for Herod wants to kill you.”[13:32] But Jesus answered,  “Go and say to that fox ‘Look you, I am driving out demons and will be completing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will have done.’ [13:33]  But today and tomorrow and the day after I must go on my way, because it cannot be that a prophet should meet his end outside Jerusalem. [13:34]  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to you – Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children around me, as a hen takes her brood under her wings, and you would not come! [13:35]  Verily your house is left to you desolate! And never, I tell you, will you see me, until you say –

|  ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’” 

 [Luke 14] 

[14:1] On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely.[14:2] There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy.[14:3]  “Is it allowable,”  said Jesus, addressing the students of the Law and the Pharisees,  “to work a cure on the Sabbath, or is it not?” [14:4] They remained silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away.[14:5] And he said to them,  “Which of you, finding that your son or your ox has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull them out on the Sabbath day?” [14:6] And they could not make any answer to that.

[14:7] Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for themselves, Jesus told them this parable –[14:8]  “When you are invited by anyone to a wedding banquet, do not seat yourself in the best place. Someone of higher rank might have been invited by your host; [14:9]  and the host who invited you both will come and say to you ‘Make room for this person,’ and then you will begin in confusion to take the lowest place. [14:10]  No, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place, so that, when the host who has invited you comes, he may say to you ‘Friend, come higher up’; and then you will be honored in the eyes of all your fellow guests. [14:11]  For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted.” 

[14:12] Then Jesus went on to say to the man who had invited him,  “When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not ask your friends, or your brothers or sisters, or your relatives, or rich neighbors, because they might invite you in return, and so you should be repaid. [14:13]  No, when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; [14:14]  and then you will be happy indeed, since they cannot reward you; for you will be rewarded at the resurrection of the good.” 

[14:15] One of the guests heard what he said and exclaimed, “Happy will be the person who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”[14:16] But Jesus said to him,  “A man was once giving a great dinner. He invited many people, [14:17]  and sent his servant, when it was time for the dinner, to say to those who had been invited ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ [14:18]  They all with one accord began to ask to be excused. The first said to the servant ‘I have bought a field and am obliged to go and look at it. I must ask you to consider me excused.’ [14:19]  The next said ‘I have bought five pairs of bullocks, and I am on my way to try them. I must ask you to consider me excused’; [14:20]  while the next said ‘I am just married, and for that reason I am unable to come.’ [14:21]  On his return the servant told his master all these answers. Then in anger the owner of the house said to his servant ‘Go out at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.’ [14:22]  Presently the servant said ‘Sir, your order has been carried out, and still there is room.’ [14:23]  ‘Go out,’ the master said, ‘into the roads and hedgerows, and make people come in, so that my house may be filled; [14:24]  for I tell you all that not one of those people who were invited will taste my dinner.’” 

[14:25] One day, when great crowds of people were walking with Jesus, he turned and said to them,[14:26]  “If any one comes to me and does not hate their father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes and even their life, he can be no disciple of mine. [14:27]  Whoever does not carry their own cross, and walk in my steps, can be no disciple of mine. [14:28]  Why, which of you, when you want to build a tower, does not first sit down and reckon the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it? – [14:29]  Otherwise, if you have laid the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will laugh at you, [14:30]  and say ‘Here is a person who began to build and was not able to finish!’ [14:31]  Or what king, when he is setting out to fight another king, does not first sit down and consider if with ten thousand men he is able to meet one who is coming against him with twenty thousand? [14:32]  And if he cannot, then, while the other is still at a distance, he sends envoys and asks for terms of peace. [14:33]  And so with everyone of you who does not bid farewell to all you have – you cannot be a disciple of mine. [14:34]  Yes, salt is good; but, if the salt itself should lose its strength, what will be used to season it? [14:35]  It is not fit either for the land or for the manure heap. People throw it away. Let those who have ears to hear with hear!” 

 [Luke 15] 


[15:1] The tax-gatherers and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus to listen to him;[15:2] but the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law found fault.

“This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!” they complained.

[15:3] So Jesus told them this parable –[15:4]  “Who among you who has a hundred sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in the open country, and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? [15:5]  And, when he has found it, he puts in on his shoulders rejoicing; [15:6]  and, on reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbors together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.’ [15:7]  So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one outcast who repents, than over ninety-nine religious people, who have no need to repent. [15:8]  Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? [15:9]  And, when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.’ [15:10]  So, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of God’s angels over one outcast who repents.” 

[15:11] Then Jesus continued,  “A man had two sons; [15:12]  and the younger of them said to his father ‘Father, give me my share of the inheritance.’ So the father divided the property between them. [15:13]  A few days later the younger son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life. [15:14]  After he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that country, and he began to be in actual want. [15:15]  So he went and engaged himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs. [15:16]  He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything. [15:17]  But, when he came to himself, he said ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death! [15:18]  I will get up and go to my father, and say to him “Father, I sinned against heaven and against you; [15:19]  I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.”’ [15:20]  And he got up and went to his father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. [15:21]  ‘Father,’ the son said, ‘I sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.’ [15:22]  But the father turned to his servants and said ‘Be quick and fetch a robe – the very best – and put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet; [15:23]  and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; [15:24]  for here is my son who was dead, and is alive again, was lost, and is found.’ So they began making merry. [15:25]  Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when he got near the house, he heard music and dancing, [15:26]  and he called one of the servants and asked what it all meant. [15:27]  ‘Your brother has come back,’ the servant told him, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’ [15:28]  This made him angry, and he would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so. [15:29]  ‘No,’ he said to his father, ‘look at all the years I have been serving you, without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might have a merrymaking with my friends. [15:30]  But, no sooner has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him.’ [15:31]  ‘Child,’ the father answered, ‘you are always with me, and everything that I have is yours. [15:32]  We could but make merry and rejoice, for here is your brother who was dead, and is alive; who was lost, and is found.’” 

 [Luke 16] 

[16:1] Jesus said to his disciples,  “There was a rich man who had a steward; and this steward was maliciously accused to him of wasting his estate. [16:2]  So the master called him and said ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give in your accounts, for you cannot act as steward any longer.’ [16:3]  ‘What am I to do,’ the steward asked himself, ‘now that my master is taking the steward’s place away from me? I have not strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. [16:4]  I know what I will do, so that, as soon as I am turned out of my stewardship, people may welcome me into their homes.’ [16:5]  One by one he called up his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked of the first. [16:6]  ‘Four hundred and forty gallons of oil,’ answered the man. ‘Here is your agreement,’ he said; ‘sit down at once and make it two hundred and twenty.’ [16:7]  And you, the steward said to the next, ‘how much do you owe?’ ‘Seventy quarters of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Here is your agreement,’ the steward said; ‘make it fifty-six.’ [16:8]  His master complimented this dishonest steward on the shrewdness of his action. And indeed men of the world are shrewder in dealing with their fellow men than those who have the light. [16:9]  And I say to you ‘Win friends for yourselves with your dishonest money,’ so that, when it comes to an end, there may be a welcome for you into the Eternal Home. [16:10]  The person who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is trustworthy in a great one also; and the person who is dishonest in the smallest matter is dishonest in a great one also. [16:11]  So, if you have proved untrustworthy with the dishonest money, who will trust you with the true? [16:12]  And, if you have proved untrustworthy with what does not belong to us, who will give you what is really our own? [16:13]  No servant can serve two masters, for, either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.” 

[16:14] All this was said within hearing of the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, and they began to sneer at Jesus.

[16:15]  “You,”  said Jesus,  “are the ones who justify themselves before the world, but God can read your hearts; and what is highly esteemed among people may be an abomination in the sight of God. [16:16]  The Law and the prophets sufficed until the time of John. Since then the good news of the kingdom of God has been told, and everybody has been forcing their way into it. [16:17]  It would be easier for the heavens and the earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be lost. [16:18]  Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is an adulterer, and the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer. [16:19]  There was once a rich man, who dressed in purple robes and fine linen, and feasted every day in great splendor. [16:20]  Near his gateway there had been laid a beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores, [16:21]  and who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. [16:22]  After a time the beggar died, and was taken by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. [16:23]  In Hades he looked up in his torment, and saw Abraham at a distance and Lazarus at his side. [16:24]  So he called out ‘Pity me, Father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering agony in this flame.’ [16:25]  ‘Child,’ answered Abraham, ‘remember that you in your lifetime received what you thought desirable, just as Lazarus received what was not desirable; but now he has his consolation here, while you are suffering agony. [16:26]  And not only that, but between you and us there lies a great chasm, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they cross from there to us.’ [16:27]  ‘Then, Father,’ he said, ‘I beg you to send Lazarus to my father’s house – [16:28]  For I have five brothers to warn them, so that they may not come to this place of torture also.’ [16:29]  ‘They have the writings of Moses and the prophets,’ replied Abraham; ‘let them listen to them.’ [16:30]  ‘But, Father Abraham,’ he urged, ‘if someone from the dead were to go to them, they would repent.’ [16:31]  ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,’ answered Abraham, ‘they will not be persuaded, even if someone were to rise from the dead.’” 

 [Luke 17] 

[17:1] Jesus said to his disciples,  “It is inevitable that there should be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! [17:2]  It would be good for them if they had been flung into the sea with a millstone around their neck, rather than that they should prove a trap even one of these little ones. [17:3]  Be on your guard! If your brother or sister does wrong, rebuke them; but if they repent, forgive them. [17:4]  Even if they wrong you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says ‘I am sorry,’ you must forgive them.” 

[17:5] “Give us more faith,” said the apostles to the Master;[17:6] but the Master said,  “If your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. [17:7]  Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, ‘Come at once and take your place at the table,’ [17:8]  Instead of saying ‘Prepare my dinner, and then make yourself ready and serve me while I am eating and drinking, and after that you will eat and drink yourself’? [17:9]  Does he feel grateful to his servant for doing what he is told? [17:10]  And so with you – when you have done all that you have been told, still say ‘We are but useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done.’” 

[17:11] On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.[17:12] As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.[17:13] Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly, “Jesus! Sir! Pity us!”[17:14] When Jesus saw them, he said,  “Go and show yourselves to the priest.”  And, as they were on their way, they were made clean.[17:15] One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly,[17:16] and threw himself on his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.[17:17]  “Were not all the ten made clean?  exclaimed Jesus.  But the nine – where are they? [17:18]  Were there none to come back and praise God except this foreigner? [17:19]  Get up,”  he said to him,  “and go on your way. Your faith has delivered you.” 

[17:20] Being once asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, Jesus answered,  “The kingdom of God does not come in a way that can be seen, [17:21]  nor will people say ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’; for the kingdom of God is within you! [17:22]  The day will come,”  he said to his disciples,  “when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of Man, and will not see it. [17:23]  People will say to you ‘There he is!’ Or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go and follow them. [17:24]  For, just as lightning will lighten and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with the Son of Man. [17:25]  But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be rejected by the present generation. [17:26]  As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be again in the days of the Son of Man. [17:27]  They were eating and drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all. [17:28]  So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; [17:29]  but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the skies and destroyed them all. [17:30]  It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself. [17:31]  On that day, if a person is on their house-top and their goods in the house, they must not go down to get them; nor again must one who is on the farm turn back. [17:32]  Remember Lot’s wife. [17:33]  Whoever is eager to get the most out of their life will lose it; but whoever will lose it will preserve it. [17:34]  On that night, I tell you, of two people on the same bed, one will be taken and the other left; [17:35]  of two women grinding grain together, one will be taken and the other left.” [17:36] ^[ 17:36 Some later manuscripts add: There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.]

[17:37] “Where will it be, Master?” asked the disciples.  “Where there is a body,”  said Jesus,  “there will the vultures flock.” 

 [Luke 18] 


[18:1] Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair.[18:2]  “There was,”  he said,  “in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people. [18:3]  In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’ [18:4]  For a time the judge refused, but afterward he said to himself ‘Although I am without fear of God or regard for people, [18:5]  yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.’” [18:6] Then the Master added,  “Listen to what this iniquitous judge says! [18:7]  And God – won’t he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them – though he holds his hand? [18:8]  He will, I tell you, give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” 

[18:9] Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this parable –[18:10]  “Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer. [18:11]  The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way – ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men – thieves, rogues, adulterers – or even like this tax-gatherer. [18:12]  I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.’ [18:13]  Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even to raise his eyes to heaven, but he kept striking his breast and saying ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ [18:14]  This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.” 

[18:15] Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them.[18:16] Jesus, however, called the little children to him.  “Let the little children come to me,”  he said,  “and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. [18:17]  I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.” 

[18:18] And one of the leaders asked Jesus this question – “Good teacher, what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?”

[18:19]  “Why do you call me good?”  answered Jesus.  “No one is good but God. [18:20]  You know the commandments – Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honor your father and your mother.” 

[18:21] “I have observed all these,” he replied, “from childhood.”[18:22] Hearing this, Jesus said to him,  “There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” [18:23] But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich.[18:24] Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples,  “How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! [18:25]  It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!” 

[18:26] “Then who can be saved?” asked those who heard this.[18:27] But Jesus said,  “What is impossible with people is possible with God.” 

[18:28] “But we,” said Peter, “we left what belonged to us and followed you.”

[18:29]  “I tell you,”  he answered,  “that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, [18:30]  who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.” 

[18:31] Gathering the Twelve around him, Jesus said to them,  “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the prophets will be done to the Son of Man. [18:32]  For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on; [18:33]  they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.” [18:34] The apostles did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them and they did not understand what he was saying.

[18:35] As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging.[18:36] Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter;[18:37] and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing,[18:38] he shouted out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!”[18:39] Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me!”[18:40] Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him,[18:41]  “What do you want me to do for you?” 

“Master,” he said, “I want to recover my sight.”[18:42] And Jesus said,  “Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.” [18:43] Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God.

 [Luke 19] 


[19:1] Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town.[19:2] There was a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a commissioner of taxes and a rich man.[19:3] He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd.[19:4] So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree, to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way.[19:5] When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him,  “Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your house today.” [19:6] So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him.[19:7] On seeing this, everyone began to complain, “He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.”[19:8] But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master, “Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times as much.”

[19:9]  “Salvation has come to this house today,”  answered Jesus,  “for even this man is a son of Abraham. [19:10]  The Son of Man has come to search for those who are lost and to save them.” 

[19:11] As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once.[19:12] He said,  “A nobleman once went to a distant country to receive his appointment to a kingdom and then return. [19:13]  He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds of silver each, and told them to trade with them during his absence. [19:14]  But his subjects hated him and sent envoys after him to say ‘We will not have this man as our king.’ [19:15]  On his return, after having been appointed king, he directed that the servants to whom he had given his money should be summoned, so that he might learn what amount of trade they had done. [19:16]  The first came up, and said ‘Sir, your ten pounds have made a hundred.’ [19:17]  ‘Well done, good servant!’ exclaimed the master. ‘As you have proved trustworthy in a very small matter, I appoint you governor over ten towns.’ [19:18]  When the second came, he said ‘Your ten pounds, Sir, have produced fifty.’ [19:19]  So the master said to him ‘And you I appoint over five towns.’ [19:20]  Another servant also came and said ‘Sir, here are your ten pounds; I have kept them put away in a handkerchief. [19:21]  For I was afraid of you, because you are a stern man. You take what you have not planted, and reap what you have not sown.’ [19:22]  The master answered ‘Out of your own mouth I judge you, you worthless servant. You knew that I am a stern man, that I take what I have not planted, and reap what I have not sown? [19:23]  Then why didn’t you put my money into a bank? And I, on my return, could have claimed it with interest. [19:24]  Take away from him the ten pounds,’ he said to those standing by, ‘and give them to the one who has the hundred.’ [19:25]  ‘But, Sir,’ they said, ‘he has a hundred pounds already!’ [19:26]  ‘I tell you,’ he answered, ‘that, to him who has, more will be given, but, from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away. [19:27]  But as for my enemies, these men who would not have me as their king, bring them here and put them to death in my presence.’” 

[19:28] After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem.

##### The Last Days #####

[19:29] It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples.[19:30]  “Go to the village facing us,”  he said,  “and, when you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has yet ridden; untie it and lead it here. [19:31]  And, if anybody asks you ‘Why are you untying it?’, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants it.’” [19:32] So the two who were sent went and found it as Jesus had told them.[19:33] While they were untying the foal, the owners asked them – “Why are you untying the foal?”[19:34] And the two disciples answered – “The Master wants it.”[19:35] Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus on it.[19:36] As he went along, the people kept spreading their cloaks in the road.[19:37] When he had almost reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, everyone of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all the miracles that they had seen:

|  [19:38] “Blessed is He who comes –
|    Our king – in the name of the Lord!
|  Peace in heaven,
|    And glory on high.”

[19:39] Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, restrain your disciples.”[19:40] But Jesus answered,  “I tell you that if they are silent, the stones will call out.” 

[19:41] When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said,[19:42]  “If only you had known, while yet there was time – even you – the things that make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your sight. [19:43]  For a time is coming when your enemies will surround you with earthworks, and encircle you, and hem you in on all sides; [19:44]  they will trample you down and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.” 

[19:45] Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who were selling,[19:46] saying as he did so,  “Scripture says – ‘My house will be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.” 

[19:47] Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the chief priests and teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and so also were the leaders of the people.[19:48] Yet they could not see what to do, for the people all hung on his words.

 [Luke 20] 


[20:1] On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, joined by the elders, confronted him,[20:2] and addressing him, said, “Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it who has given you this authority?”

[20:3]  “I, too,”  said Jesus in reply,  “will ask you one question. Give me an answer to it. [20:4]  It is about John’s baptism – was it of divine or of human origin?” [20:5] But they began arguing together, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’[20:6] But, if we say ‘human,’ the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”[20:7] So they answered that they did not know its origin.[20:8]  “Then I,”  said Jesus,  “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.” 

[20:9] But Jesus began to tell the people this parable –  “A man once planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for a long while. [20:10]  At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they could give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. [20:11]  The owner afterward sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this man too, and sent him away empty-handed. [20:12]  He sent a third; but they wounded this man also, and threw him outside. [20:13]  ‘What should I do?’ said the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my son, who is very dear to me. Perhaps they will respect him.’ [20:14]  But, on seeing him, the tenants consulted with one another. ‘Here is the heir!’ they said. ‘Let us kill him, and then the inheritance will become ours.’ [20:15]  So they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them? [20:16]  He will come and put those tenants to death, and will let the vineyard to others.” 

“Heaven forbid!” they exclaimed when they heard it.[20:17] But Jesus looked at them and said,  “What then is the meaning of this passage? –

|  ‘The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone.’ 

[20:18]  Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.” 

[20:19] After this the teachers of the Law and the chief priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.[20:20] Having watched their opportunity, they afterward sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor’s jurisdiction and authority.[20:21] These spies asked Jesus a question. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly;[20:22] are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?”[20:23] Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them,[20:24]  “Show me a coin. Whose head and title are on it?” 

[20:25] “The Emperor’s,” they said; and Jesus replied,  “Well then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” [20:26] They could not lay hold of this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues.

[20:27] Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –[20:28] “Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that –

|  ‘Should a man’s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.’

[20:29] Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless.[20:30] The second and third brothers both took her as their wife;[20:31] and so, too, did all seven – dying without children.[20:32] The woman herself was the last to die.[20:33] About the woman, then – at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?”

[20:34]  “The men and women of this world,”  said Jesus,  “marry and are given in marriage; [20:35]  but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or being married, [20:36]  nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God’s children. [20:37]  As to the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord –

|  ‘The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ 

[20:38]  Now he is not God of dead people, but of living. For in his sight all are alive.” 

[20:39] “Well said, teacher!” exclaimed some of the teachers of the Law,[20:40] for they did not venture to question him any further.[20:41] But Jesus said to them,  “How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David’s son? [20:42]  For David, in the book of Psalms, says himself –

|  ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, 
|  [20:43]  until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ 

[20:44]  David, then, calls him ‘lord,’ so how is he David’s son?” 

[20:45] While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples,[20:46]  “Be on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at dinner. [20:47]  These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.” 

 [Luke 21] 

[21:1] Looking up, Jesus saw the rich people putting their gifts into the chests for the Temple offerings.[21:2] He saw, too, a widow in poor circumstances putting two small coins into them.[21:3]  “I tell you” , he said  “that this poor widow has put in more than all the others; [21:4]  for everyone else here put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, has put in all she had to live on.” 

[21:5] When some of them spoke about the Temple being decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said,[21:6]  “As for these things that you are looking at, a time is coming when not one stone will be left on another here. Every one will be thrown down.” [21:7] So the disciples questioned Jesus, “But, teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is near?”

[21:8] And Jesus said,  “See that you are not led astray; for many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He,’ and ‘The time is close at hand.’ Do not follow them. [21:9]  And, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must occur first; but the end will not be at once.” [21:10] Then he said to them,  “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, [21:11]  and there will be great earthquakes, and plagues and famines in various places, and there will be terrible appearances and signs in the heavens. [21:12]  Before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, and they will betray you to synagogues and put you in prison, when you will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name. [21:13]  Then will be your opportunity of witnessing for me. [21:14]  Make up your minds, therefore, not to prepare your defense; [21:15]  for I will myself give you words, and a wisdom which all your opponents together will be unable to resist or defy. [21:16]  You will be betrayed even by your parents and brothers and sisters and sisters and relatives and friends, and they will cause some of you to be put to death, [21:17]  and you will be hated by everyone because of me my name. [21:18]  Yet not a single hair of your heads will be lost! [21:19]  By your endurance you will win yourselves life. [21:20]  As soon, however, as you see Jerusalem surrounded by armed camps, then you may know that the hour of her desecration is at hand. [21:21]  Then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains, those who are in Jerusalem must leave at once, and those who are in the country places must not go into it. [21:22]  For these are to be the days of vengeance, when all that scripture says will be fulfilled. [21:23]  Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great suffering in the land, and anger against this people. [21:24]  They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be taken prisoners to every land, and Jerusalem will be under the heel of the Gentiles, until their day is over – as it will be. [21:25]  There will be signs, too, in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth despair among the nations, in their dismay at the roar of the sea and the surge. [21:26]  People’s hearts will fail them through dread of what is coming upon the world; for the forces of the heavens will be convulsed. [21:27]  Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [21:28]  And, when these things begin to occur, look upwards and lift your heads, for your deliverance will be at hand.” 

[21:29] Then he taught them a lesson, saying –  “Look at the fig tree and all the other trees. [21:30]  As soon as they shoot, you know, as you look at them, without being told, that summer is near. [21:31]  And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. [21:32]  I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away until all has taken place. [21:33]  The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. [21:34]  Be on your guard or your minds will become dulled by debauches or drunkenness or the anxieties of life, and ‘that day’ will close on you suddenly like a trap. [21:35]  For come it will on all who are living upon the face of the whole earth. [21:36]  Be on the watch at all times, and pray that you may have strength to escape all that is destined to happen, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.” 

[21:37] During the days, Jesus continued to teach in the Temple Courts, but he went out and spent the nights on the hill called the ‘Mount of Olives.’[21:38] And all the people would get up early in the morning and come to listen to him in the Temple Courts.

 [Luke 22] 


[22:1] The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.[22:2] The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.

[22:3] Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;[22:4] and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.[22:5] They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.[22:6] So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.

[22:7] When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,[22:8] Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them,  “Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.” 

[22:9] “Where do you wish us to make preparations?” they asked.[22:10]  “Listen,”  he answered,  “when you have got into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters; [22:11]  and you will say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says to you – Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’ [22:12]  The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.” 

[22:13] So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

[22:14] When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.[22:15]  “I have most earnestly wished,”  he said,  “to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. [22:16]  For I tell you that I will not eat it again, until it has had its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” [22:17] Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said,  “Take this and share it among you. [22:18]  For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink of the juice of the grape, until the kingdom of God has come.” [22:19] Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words,  “This is my body. [22:20] ^[ 22:20 Some later manuscripts add: which is now to be given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me. And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying: “This cup is the New Covenant made by my blood which is being poured out on your behalf.”][22:21]  Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on the table! [22:22]  True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!” [22:23] Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this.

[22:24] And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.[22:25] Jesus, however, said,  “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled ‘Benefactors.’ [22:26]  But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves. [22:27]  Which is the greater – the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves. [22:28]  You are the men who have stood by me in my trials; [22:29]  and, just as my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places, [22:30]  so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. [22:31]  Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat, [22:32]  but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen the others.” 

[22:33] “Master,” said Peter, “with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.”

[22:34]  “I tell you, Peter,”  replied Jesus,  “the cock will not crow today until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.” [22:35] Then he said to them all,  “When I sent you out as my messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?” 

“No; nothing,” they answered.[22:36]  “Now, however,”  he said,  “he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword. [22:37]  For, I tell you, that passage of scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says – ‘He was counted among the godless’; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfillment.” 

[22:38] “Master,” they exclaimed, “look, here are two swords!”

 “Enough!”  said Jesus.

[22:39] Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.[22:40] And, when he reached the spot, he said to them,  “Pray that you may not fall into temptation.” [22:41] Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.[22:42]  “Father,”  he said,  “if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but your be done.” [22:43] Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.^[ 22:43 Some later manuscripts do not contain verses 43 or 44.][22:44] And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.[22:45] Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.[22:46]  “Why are you asleep?”  he asked them.  “Rise and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation.” [22:47] While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;[22:48] at which Jesus said to him,  “Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?” [22:49] But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, “Master, should we use our swords?”[22:50] And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear;[22:51] at which Jesus said,  “Let me at least do this”; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound. [22:52] Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said,  “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs? [22:53]  When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.” 

[22:54] Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.[22:55] But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.[22:56] Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, “Why, this man was one of his companions!”[22:57] But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied.[22:58] A little while afterward someone else – a man – saw him and said, “Why, you are one of them!”

“No,” Peter said, “I am not.”[22:59] About an hour later another man declared positively, “This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!”[22:60] But Peter said, “I do not know what you are speaking about.” Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.[22:61] And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him –  “Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times”; [22:62] and he went outside and wept bitterly.

[22:63] The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.[22:64] They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said. “Who was it that struck you?”[22:65] And they heaped many other insults on him.

[22:66] At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council.[22:67] “If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.”

 “If I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “you will not believe me; [22:68]  and, if I question you, you will not answer. [22:69]  But from this hour the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.” 

[22:70] “Are you, then, the Son of God?” they all asked.  “It is true,”  answered Jesus,  “I am.” [22:71] At this they exclaimed, “Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”

 [Luke 23] 

[23:1] Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.[23:2] And they began to accuse him, “This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is ‘Christ, a king.’”

[23:3] “Are you the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked him.  “It is true,”  replied Jesus.[23:4] But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said, “I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.”[23:5] But they insisted, “He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.”[23:6] Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;[23:7] and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.[23:8] When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.[23:9] So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.[23:10] Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.[23:11] And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe around him, and then sent him back to Pilate.[23:12] And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.

[23:13] So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people,[23:14] and said to them, “You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;[23:15] nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;[23:16] so I will have him scourged, and then release him.”[23:17] ^[ 23:17 Some later manuscripts add: He had to release someone to them at the feast.][23:18] But they began to shout as one man, “Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.”[23:19] (Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.)[23:20] Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again;[23:21] but they kept calling out, “Crucify, crucify him!”

[23:22] “Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.”[23:23] But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.[23:24] Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.[23:25] He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.

[23:26] And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.[23:27] There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.[23:28] So Jesus turned and said to them,  “Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. [23:29]  A time, I tell you, is coming, when it will be said – ‘Happy are the women who are barren, and those who have never borne children or nursed them!’ [23:30]  At that time people will begin to say to the mountains ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills ‘Cover us.’ [23:31]  If what you see is done while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?” [23:32] There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus.[23:33] When they had reached the place called ‘The Skull,’ there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.[23:34] Then Jesus said,  “Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.”  His clothes they divided among them by casting lots.[23:35] Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.”[23:36] The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,[23:37] and saying as they did so, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”[23:38] Above him were the words –

|  ‘THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’

[23:39] One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him. “Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us,” he said.[23:40] But the other rebuked him. “Haven’t you,” he said, “any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence?[23:41] And we justly so, for we are only reaping our deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong.[23:42] Jesus,” he went on, “do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.”[23:43] And Jesus answered,  “I tell you, this very day you will be with me in Paradise.” 

[23:44] It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon,[23:45] the sun being eclipsed; and the Temple curtain was torn down the middle.[23:46] Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said,  “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”  And with these words he expired.[23:47] The Roman captain, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming, “This must have been a good man!”[23:48] All the people who had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home beating their breasts.[23:49] All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all this.

[23:50] Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character.[23:51] (This man had not assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to Ramah, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of God.[23:52] He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus;[23:53] and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried.[23:54] It was the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began.[23:55] The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how the body of Jesus was laid,[23:56] and then went home, and prepared spices and perfumes.

##### The Risen Life #####

During the Sabbath they rested, as directed by the commandment.

 [Luke 24] 

[24:1] But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, taking with them the spices that they had prepared.[24:2] They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb;[24:3] and, on going into it, they could not find the body^[ 24:3 Some later manuscripts add: of the Lord Jesus.].[24:4] While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing.[24:5] But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living?[24:6] ^[ 24:6 Some later manuscripts add: He is not here but he has risen.] Remember how he spoke to you before he left Galilee –[24:7] How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.”[24:8] Then they remembered the words of Jesus,[24:9] and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.[24:10] There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles.[24:11] What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them.[24:12] ^[ 24:12 Some later manuscripts add: Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down he saw nothing but the linen wrappings, and he went away, wondering to himself at what had taken place.]

[24:13] It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,[24:14] talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.[24:15] While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them;[24:16] but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognize him.[24:17]  “What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?”  Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,[24:18] and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, “Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?”

[24:19]  “What things do you mean?”  asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;[24:20] and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterward crucified him.[24:21] But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.[24:22] And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak[24:23] And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.[24:24] So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”

[24:25] Then Jesus said to them,  “Foolish men, slow to accept all that the prophets have said! [24:26]  Was not the Christ bound to undergo this suffering before entering into his glory?” [24:27] Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself.[24:28] When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further;[24:29] but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them.[24:30] After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them.[24:31] Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from their sight.[24:32] “How our hearts glowed,” the disciples said to each other, “while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!”

[24:33] Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together,[24:34] who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon.[24:35] So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognized Jesus at the breaking of the bread.[24:36] While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them.^[ 24:36 Some later manuscripts add: and said, “Peace be with you.”][24:37] In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost,[24:38] but Jesus said to them,  “Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds? [24:39]  Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” [24:40] ^[ 24:40 Some later manuscripts add: After saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.][24:41] While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them,  “Have you anything here to eat?” [24:42] They handed him a piece of broiled fish,[24:43] and he took it and ate it before their eyes.[24:44]  “This is what I told you,”  he said,  “when I was still with you – that everything that had been written about me in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled.” 

[24:45] Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them,[24:46]  “Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he will rise again from the dead on the third day, [24:47]  and that repentance for forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed on his authority to all the nations – beginning at Jerusalem. [24:48]  You yourselves are to be witnesses to all this. [24:49]  And now I am myself about to send you that which my Father has promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested with power from above.” 

[24:50] After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them.[24:51] As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them.^[ 24:51 Some later manuscripts add: and was carried up into heaven.][24:52] They returned^[ 24:52 Some later manuscripts read: They bowed to the ground before him and returned.] to Jerusalem full of joy;[24:53] and they were constantly in the Temple Courts, blessing God.

 [John 1] 

##### Introduction #####



|  [1:1] In the beginning the Word was;
|    and the Word was with God;
|    and the Word was God.

|  [1:2] He was in the beginning with God;
|    [1:3] through him all things came into being,
|    and nothing came into being apart from him.
|  [1:4] That which came into being in him was life;
|    and the life was the light of humanity;
|    [1:5] and the light shines in the darkness,
|    and the darkness never overpowered it.

|  [1:6] There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;
|    [1:7] he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light
|    so that through him everyone might believe.
|  [1:8] He was not the light,
|    but he came to bear witness to the light.

|  [1:9] That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.
|  [1:10] He was in the world;
|    and through him the world came into being –
|    yet the world did not know him.

|  [1:11] He came to his own –
|    yet his own did not receive him.
|  [1:12] But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God –
|    to those who believe in his name.
|  [1:13] For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life,
|    but to God.

|  [1:14] And the Word became human, and lived among us,
|    (We saw his glory – the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father),
|    full of love and truth.
|  [1:15] (John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke –
|    “He who is coming after me is now before me,
|    for he was ever first”);
|  [1:16] out of his fullness we have all received some gift,
|    gift after gift of love;
|  [1:17] for the Law was given through Moses,
|    love and truth came through Jesus Christ.
|  [1:18] No one has ever yet seen God;
|    God the Only Son, who is ever with the Father –
|  He has revealed him.

##### The Preparation #####

[1:19] When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”,[1:20] he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.”

[1:21] “What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”

“No,” he said, “I am not.”

“Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.”

[1:22] “Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

[1:23] “I,” he answered, “am –

|  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord’,

as the prophet Isaiah said.”

[1:24] These men had been sent from the Pharisees;[1:25] and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”[1:26] John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;[1:27] he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”[1:28] This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

[1:29] The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world![1:30] I was taking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’[1:31] I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”[1:32] John also said:

“I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.[1:33] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’[1:34] This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”

[1:35] The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,[1:36] he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!”[1:37] The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.[1:38] But Jesus turned around, and saw them following.  “What are you looking for?”  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?”

[1:39]  “Come, and you will see,”  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him.

It was then about four in the afternoon.[1:40] One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.[1:41] He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)[1:42] Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said,  “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).[1:43] The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him,  “Follow me.” [1:44] Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.[1:45] He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”

[1:46] “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.[1:47] When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said,  “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!” 

[1:48] “How do you know me?” asked Nathanael.  “Even before Philip called you,”  replied Jesus,  “when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 

[1:49] “Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”

[1:50]  “Do you believe in me,”  asked Jesus,  “because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those! [1:51]  In truth I tell you,”  he added,  “you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” 

 [John 2] 

##### The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria #####

[2:1] Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.[2:2] Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.[2:3] And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”

[2:4]  “What do you want with me?”  answered Jesus.  “My time has not come yet.” [2:5] His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”[2:6] There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.

[2:7] Jesus said to the servants,  “Fill the water-jars with water.” [2:8] And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added,  “Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”  The servants did so.[2:9] And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –[2:10] He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”[2:11] This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

[2:12] After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.

[2:13] Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.[2:14] In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.[2:15] So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,[2:16] and said to the pigeon-dealers,  “Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.” [2:17] His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’

[2:18] Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”

[2:19]  “Destroy this temple,”  was his answer,  “and I will raise it in three days.” 

[2:20] “This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”[2:21] But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.[2:22] Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.

[2:23] While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.[2:24] But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.[2:25] He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.

 [John 3] 


[3:1] Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.[3:2] This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”

[3:3]  “In truth I tell you,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.” 

[3:4] “How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”

[3:5]  “In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. [3:6]  All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual. [3:7]  Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn. [3:8]  The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.” 

[3:9] “How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.[3:10]  “What! You a teacher of Israel,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “and yet do not understand this! [3:11]  In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements. [3:12]  If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things? [3:13]  No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven – the Son of Man himself. [3:14]  And, as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up; [3:15]  so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.” 

[3:16]  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. [3:17]  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him. [3:18]  The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God. [3:19]  The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked. [3:20]  For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed; [3:21]  but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do. 

[3:22] After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.[3:23] John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.[3:24] (For John had not yet been imprisoned).[3:25] Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification;[3:26] and the disciples came to John and said, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”[3:27] John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.[3:28] You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’[3:29] It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.[3:30] He must become greater, and I less.”

[3:31] He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.[3:32] He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.[3:33] They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.[3:34] For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.[3:35] The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.[3:36] The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure.

 [John 4] 


[4:1] Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John[4:2] (Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),[4:3] he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.[4:4] He had to pass through Samaria,[4:5] and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.[4:6] Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.[4:7] A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her –  “Give me some to drink,” [4:8] For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.[4:9] “How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).[4:10]  “If you knew of the gift of God,”  replied Jesus,  “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” 

[4:11] “You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said. “Where did you get that ‘living water?’[4:12] Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!”

[4:13]  “All who drink of this water,”  replied Jesus,  “will be thirsty again; [4:14]  but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.” 

[4:15] “Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.”

[4:16]  “Go and call your husband,”  said Jesus,  “and then come back.” 

[4:17] “I have no husband,” answered the woman.  “You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’”  replied Jesus,[4:18]  “For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.” 

[4:19] “I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.[4:20] “It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.”

[4:21]  “Believe me,”  replied Jesus,  “a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father. [4:22]  You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews. [4:23]  But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires. [4:24]  God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.” 

[4:25] “I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.”

[4:26]  “I am he,”  Jesus said to her,  “I who am speaking to you.” [4:27] At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’[4:28] So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,[4:29] “Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”[4:30] And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.

[4:31] Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.”

[4:32]  “I have food to eat,”  he answered,  “of which you know nothing.” 

[4:33] “Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.[4:34]  “My food,”  replied Jesus,  “is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work. [4:35]  Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest! [4:36]  Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together. [4:37]  For here the proverb holds good – ‘One sows, another reaps.’ [4:38]  I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.” 

[4:39] Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’[4:40] And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.[4:41] But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,[4:42] and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.”

[4:43] After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;[4:44] for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’[4:45] When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.[4:46] So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.[4:47] When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.[4:48] Jesus answered,  “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.” 

[4:49] “Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.”[4:50] The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;[4:51] and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.[4:52] So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”[4:53] By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him  ‘Your son is living’ ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.[4:54] This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.

 [John 5] 


[5:1] Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.[5:2] There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades around it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’[5:3] In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled.[5:4] ^[ 5:4 Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had.][5:5] One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years.[5:6] Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him,  “Do you wish to be cured?” 

[5:7] “I have no one, Sir,” the sick man answered, “to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.”

[5:8]  “Stand up,”  said Jesus,  “take up your mat, and walk.” [5:9] The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking.[5:10] Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.”

[5:11] “The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me  ‘Take up your mat and walk.’” 

[5:12] “Who was it,” they asked, “that said to you  ‘Take up your mat and walk’?” [5:13] But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.[5:14] Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him,  “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.” 

[5:15] The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.[5:16] And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.[5:17] But Jesus replied,  “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.” [5:18] This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God.

[5:19] So Jesus made this further reply,  “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also. [5:20]  For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder. [5:21]  For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases. [5:22]  The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son, [5:23]  so that everyone may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him. [5:24]  In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life. [5:25]  In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live. [5:26]  For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him; [5:27]  and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge. [5:28]  Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice, [5:29]  and will come out – those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation. [5:30]  I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. 

[5:31]  “If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy; [5:32]  it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy. [5:33]  You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. [5:34]  But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation. [5:35]  He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light. [5:36]  But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John’s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out – the work that I am doing – is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger. [5:37]  The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form; [5:38]  and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger. [5:39]  You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life;  and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me,[5:40]  you refuse to come to me to have life. 

[5:41]  “I do not receive honor from people, [5:42]  but I know this of you, that you have not the love of God in your hearts. [5:43]  I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. [5:44]  How can you believe in me, when you receive honor from one another and do not desire the honor which comes from the only God? [5:45]  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes. [5:46]  For, had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote; [5:47]  but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my teaching?” 

 [John 6] 


[6:1] After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.[6:2] A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.[6:3] Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.[6:4] It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.[6:5] Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,  “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?” [6:6] He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.[6:7] “Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,” answered Philip, “it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.”

[6:8] “There is a boy here,” said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother,[6:9] “Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?”

[6:10]  “Make the people sit down,”  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,[6:11] and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.[6:12] When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,  “Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.” [6:13] The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.

[6:14] When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, “This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.”[6:15] But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone.

[6:16] When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,[6:17] and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;[6:18] the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.[6:19] When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.[6:20] But Jesus said to them,  “It is I; do not be afraid!” [6:21] And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.

[6:22] The people who remained on the further side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.[6:23] Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.[6:24] So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.[6:25] And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?”

[6:26]  “In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied. [6:27]  Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.” 

[6:28] “How,” they asked, “are we to do the work that God wants us to do?”

[6:29]  “The work that God wants you to do,”  answered Jesus,  “is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.” 

[6:30] “What sign, then,” they asked, “are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?[6:31] Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”

[6:32]  “In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven; [6:33]  for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.” 

[6:34] “Master,” they exclaimed, “give us that bread always!”

[6:35]  “I am the life-giving bread,”  Jesus said to them,  “whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst again. [6:36]  But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me. [6:37]  All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away. [6:38]  For I have come down from heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me; [6:39]  and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day. [6:40]  For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.” 

[6:41] The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying –  ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven.’ [6:42] “Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,” they asked, “whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?”

[6:43]  “Do not murmur among yourselves,”  said Jesus in reply.[6:44]  “No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day. [6:45]  It is said in the prophets – ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me. [6:46]  Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father. [6:47]  In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life. [6:48]  I am the life-giving bread. [6:49]  Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died. [6:50]  The bread that comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die. [6:51]  I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” 

[6:52] They began disputing with one another, “How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?”

[6:53]  “In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you. [6:54]  Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day. [6:55]  For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink. [6:56]  Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them. [6:57]  As the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live because I live. [6:58]  That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.” 

[6:59] All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.[6:60] On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?”[6:61] But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them,[6:62]  “Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? [6:63]  It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life. [6:64]  Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.”  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;[6:65] and he added,  “This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.” [6:66] After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.[6:67] So Jesus said to the Twelve,  “Do you also wish to leave me?” [6:68] But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;[6:69] and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”

[6:70]  “Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?”  replied Jesus,  “and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.” [6:71] He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.

 [John 7] 


[7:1] After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.[7:2] When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,[7:3] his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.[7:4] For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”[7:5] For even his brothers did not believe in him.

[7:6]  “My time,”  answered Jesus,  “is not come yet, but your time is always here. [7:7]  The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil. [7:8]  Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.” [7:9] After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.

[7:10] But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.[7:11] The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;[7:12] and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’[7:13] No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities.

[7:14] About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.[7:15] The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”[7:16] So, in reply, Jesus said,  “My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me. [7:17]  If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority. [7:18]  The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him. [7:19]  Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?” 

[7:20] “You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”

[7:21]  “There was one thing I did,”  replied Jesus,  “at which you are all still wondering. [7:22]  But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath. [7:23]  When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath? [7:24]  Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.” [7:25] At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?[7:26] Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?[7:27] Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”[7:28] Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said,  “Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know. [7:29]  I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.” [7:30] So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.[7:31] Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”[7:32] The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;[7:33] at which Jesus said,  “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. [7:34]  You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.” 

[7:35] “Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?[7:36] What does he mean by saying  ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?” 

[7:37] On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed,  “If anyone thirsts, they should come to me, and drink. [7:38]  I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.” [7:39] (By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)[7:40] Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;[7:41] others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?[7:42] Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”[7:43] So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.[7:44] Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.[7:45] When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?”

[7:46] “No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.[7:47] “What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.[7:48] “Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?[7:49] As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”[7:50] But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,[7:51] “Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?”

[7:52] “Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”

[7:53] And everyone went home

 [John 8] 

[8:1] except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives^[ 8:1 This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.].[8:2] But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.[8:3] Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,[8:4] and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.[8:5] Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?”

[8:6] They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.[8:7] However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.”

[8:8] And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.[8:9] When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.[8:10] Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”

[8:11] “No one, Sir,” she answered.

“Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.”

[8:12] Jesus again addressed the people.  “I am the light of the world,”  he said.  “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 

[8:13] “You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.”

[8:14]  “Even if I bear testimony to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going. [8:15]  You judge by appearances; I judge no one. [8:16]  Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. [8:17]  Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy. [8:18]  I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.” [8:19]  “Where is your father, then?”  they asked.  “You know neither me nor my Father,”  replied Jesus.  “If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.” [8:20] These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.

[8:21] Jesus again spoke to the people.  “I am going away,”  he said,  “and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.” 

[8:22] “Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says –  ‘You cannot go where I am going’?” [8:23]  “You,”  added Jesus,  “are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not; [8:24]  and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.” 

[8:25] “Who are you?” they asked.  “Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”  said Jesus.[8:26]  “I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.” [8:27] They did not understand that he meant the Father.[8:28] So Jesus added,  “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me. [8:29]  Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.” [8:30] While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.[8:31] So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him,  “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples; [8:32]  and you find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 

[8:33] “We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying  ‘you will be set free’?” [8:34]  “In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “everyone who sins is a slave to sin. [8:35]  And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always. [8:36]  If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed! [8:37]  I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts. [8:38]  I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.” 

[8:39] “Our father is Abraham,” was their answer.  “If you are Abraham’s children,”  replied Jesus,  “do what Abraham did. [8:40]  But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way. [8:41]  You are doing what your own father does.” 

“We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father – God himself.”

[8:42]  “If God were your Father,”  Jesus replied,  “you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger. [8:43]  How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message. [8:44]  As for you, you are children of your Father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying. [8:45]  But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me. [8:46]  Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth? [8:47]  The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.” 

[8:48] “Aren’t we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?”

[8:49]  “I am not possessed by a demon,”  Jesus answered,  “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me. [8:50]  Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides. [8:51]  In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.” 

[8:52] “Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say  ‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’ [8:53] Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?”

[8:54]  “If I do honor to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor – and you say that he is your God; [8:55]  and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart. [8:56]  Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.” 

[8:57] “You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?”

[8:58]  “In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “before Abraham existed I was.” [8:59] At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.

 [John 9] 


[9:1] As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.[9:2] “Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

[9:3]  “Neither the man nor the parents,”  replied Jesus,  “but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him. [9:4]  We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. [9:5]  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” [9:6] Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.[9:7]  “Go,”  he said,  “and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam”  (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.[9:8] His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?”

[9:9] “Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.”

[9:10] “How did you get your sight, then?” they asked.[9:11] “The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me  ‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.”

[9:12] “Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.[9:13] They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.[9:14] Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and gave him his sight.[9:15] So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put clay on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.”

[9:16] “The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.”

“How is it possible,” retorted others, “for a bad man to give signs like this?”[9:17] So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?”[9:18] The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.[9:19] “Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?”

[9:20] “We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind;[9:21] but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.”[9:22] His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.[9:23] This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’[9:24] So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.”

[9:25] “I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.”

[9:26] “What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?”

[9:27] “I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?”

[9:28] “You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses.[9:29] We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”

[9:30] “Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight![9:31] We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.[9:32] Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.[9:33] If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.”

[9:34] “You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him.[9:35] Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked,  “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 

[9:36] “Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.”

[9:37]  “Not only have you seen him,”  said Jesus,  “but it is he who is now speaking to you.” 

[9:38] “Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him;[9:39] and Jesus added,  “It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.” [9:40] Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?”

[9:41]  “If you had been blind,”  replied Jesus,  “you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains. 

 [John 10] 

[10:1]  In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber; [10:2]  but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep. [10:3]  For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. [10:4]  When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice. [10:5]  They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.” [10:6] This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.[10:7] So he continued,  “In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep. [10:8]  All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them. [10:9]  I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture. [10:10]  The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness. [10:11]  I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. [10:12]  The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock. [10:13]  He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep. [10:14]  I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me – [10:15]  Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep. [10:16]  I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd. [10:17]  This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again. [10:18]  No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.” 

[10:19] In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.[10:20] Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?”[10:21] Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?”

[10:22] Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.[10:23] It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,[10:24] when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.”

[10:25]  “I have told you so,”  replied Jesus,  “and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me. [10:26]  But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock. [10:27]  My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me; [10:28]  and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands. [10:29]  What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands. [10:30]  The Father and I are one.” 

[10:31] Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;[10:32] and seeing this, Jesus said,  “I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?” 

[10:33] “It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.”

[10:34]  “Are there not,”  replied Jesus,  “these words in your Law – ‘I said, You are gods’? [10:35]  If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ – and scripture cannot be set aside – [10:36]  do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’? [10:37]  If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me; [10:38]  if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.” [10:39] The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.

[10:40] Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.[10:41] “John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.”[10:42] And many learned to believe in Jesus there.

 [John 11] 


[11:1] Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.[11:2] This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.[11:3] The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’;[11:4] and, when Jesus heard it, he said,  “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.” [11:5] Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.[11:6] Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.[11:7] Then, after that, he said to his disciples,  “Let us go to Judea again.” 

[11:8] “Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?”

[11:9]  “Are not there twelve hours in the day?”  answered Jesus.  “If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun; [11:10]  but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.” [11:11] And, when he had said this, he added,  “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.” 

[11:12] “If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples.[11:13] But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.[11:14] Then he said to them plainly,  “Lazarus is dead; [11:15]  and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.” [11:16] At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”[11:17] When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.[11:18] Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,[11:19] a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of brother’s death.[11:20] When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.[11:21] “Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.[11:22] Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.”

[11:23]  “Your brother will rise to life,”  said Jesus.[11:24] “I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.”

[11:25]  “I am the resurrection and the life,”  said Jesus.  “He who believes in me will live, though he die; [11:26]  and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” 

[11:27] “Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”[11:28] After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.”[11:29] As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.[11:30] Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.[11:31] So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.[11:32] When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!”[11:33] When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.[11:34]  “Where have you buried him?”  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered.[11:35] Jesus burst into tears.[11:36] “How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed;[11:37] but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?”[11:38] Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.[11:39]  “Move the stone away,”  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.”

[11:40]  “Didn’t I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?” [11:41] So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said,  “Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer; [11:42]  I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.” 

[11:43] Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice,  “Lazarus! Come out!” [11:44] The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth.  “Set him free,”  said Jesus,  “and let him go.” 

[11:45] In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, learned to believe in him.[11:46] Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.[11:47] The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?[11:48] If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our city and our Nationality.”[11:49] One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,[11:50] “You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”[11:51] Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –[11:52] And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.[11:53] So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.

[11:54] In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.[11:55] But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.[11:56] So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”[11:57] The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.

 [John 12] 

##### The Last Days #####

[12:1] Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.[12:2] There a supper was given in honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.[12:3] So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.[12:4] One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,[12:5] “Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?”[12:6] He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.[12:7]  “Leave her alone,”  said Jesus,  “so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial. [12:8]  The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.” 

[12:9] Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.[12:10] The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,[12:11] because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.[12:12] On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,[12:13] and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord – The king of Israel!”[12:14] Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –[12:15] ‘Fear not, people of Zion; Your king is coming to you, Sitting on the foal of an ass.’[12:16] His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.[12:17] Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.[12:18] This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.[12:19] So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!”

[12:20] Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,[12:21] who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”[12:22] Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.[12:23] This was his reply –  “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted. [12:24]  In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful. [12:25]  A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life. [12:26]  If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them. [12:27]  Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour – [12:28]  Father, honor your own name.”  At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.”[12:29] The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.”

[12:30]  “It was not for my sake that the voice came,”  said Jesus,  “but for yours. [12:31]  Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out; [12:32]  and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” [12:33] By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.[12:34] “We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be  ‘lifted up’  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”

[12:35]  “Only a little while longer,”  answered Jesus,  “will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going. [12:36]  While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.”  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.[12:37] But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,[12:38] in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’[12:39] The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words –[12:40] ‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.’[12:41] Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.[12:42] Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues;[12:43] for they valued honor from people more than honor from God.[12:44] But Jesus had proclaimed,  “He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me; [12:45]  and he who sees me sees him who sent me. [12:46]  I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness. [12:47]  When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. [12:48]  He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day. [12:49]  For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver. [12:50]  And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.” 

 [John 13] 

[13:1] Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.[13:2] The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;[13:3] and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God –[13:4] Rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist.[13:5] He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him.[13:6] When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?”

[13:7]  “You do not understand now what I am doing,”  replied Jesus,  “but you will learn by and by.” 

[13:8] “You will never wash my feet!” exclaimed Peter.  “Unless I wash you,”  answered Jesus,  “you have nothing in common with me.” 

[13:9] “Then, Master, not my feet only,” exclaimed Simon Peter, “but also my hands and my head.”

[13:10]  “He who has bathed,”  replied Jesus,  “has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,”  he said to the disciples,  “are clean, yet not all of you.” [13:11] For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said  ‘You are not all clean.’ [13:12] When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again.  “Do you understand what I have been doing to you?”  he asked.[13:13]  “You yourselves call me ‘the teacher’ and ‘the Master’, and you are right, for I am both. [13:14]  If I, then – ‘the Master’ and ‘the teacher’ – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet; [13:15]  for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you. [13:16]  In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them. [13:17]  Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them. [13:18]  I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’ [13:19]  For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am. [13:20]  In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.” [13:21] After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,  “In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.” [13:22] The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.[13:23] Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.[13:24] So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, “Tell me who it is that he means.”[13:25] Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, “Who is it, Master?”

[13:26]  “It is the one,”  answered Jesus,  “to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.”  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;[13:27] and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him,  “Do at once what you are going to do.” [13:28] But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.[13:29] Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.[13:30] After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.

[13:31] When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,  “Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him; [13:32]  and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith. [13:33]  My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – ‘You cannot come where I am going’ – I now say to you. [13:34]  I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you. [13:35]  It is by this that everyone will recognize you as my disciples – by your loving one another.” 

[13:36] “Where are you going, Master?” asked Peter.  “I am going where you cannot now follow me,”  answered Jesus,  “but you will follow me later.” 

[13:37] “Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.”

[13:38]  “Will you lay down your life for me?”  replied Jesus.  “In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times. 

 [John 14] 

[14:1]  Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. [14:2]  In my Father’s Home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you. [14:3]  And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am; [14:4]  and you know the way to the place where I am going.” 

[14:5] “We do not know where you are going, Master,” said Thomas. “So how can we know the way?”[14:6] Jesus answered,  “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me. [14:7]  If you had recognized me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognize him, indeed you have already seen him.” 

[14:8] “Master, show us the Father,” said Philip, “and we will be satisfied.”

[14:9]  “Have I been all this time among you,”  said Jesus,  “and yet you, Philip, have not recognized me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, ‘Show us the Father’? [14:10]  Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work. [14:11]  Believe me,” he said to them all, “when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself. [14:12]  In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father. [14:13]  Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honored in the Son. [14:14]  If you ask anything, in my name, I will do it. [14:15]  If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart, [14:16]  and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you always – the Spirit of truth. [14:17]  The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognize him, but you recognize him, because he is always with you, and is within you. [14:18]  I will not leave you bereaved; I will come to you. [14:19]  In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living also. [14:20]  At that time you will recognize that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you. [14:21]  It is they who have my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.” 

[14:22] “What has happened, Master,” said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), “that you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”

[14:23]  “Whoever loves me,”  Jesus answered,  “will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. [14:24]  The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me. [14:25]  I have told you all this while still with you, [14:26]  but the helper – the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name – will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you. [14:27]  Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed. [14:28]  You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. [14:29]  And this I have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you may still believe in me. [14:30]  I will not talk with you much more, for the Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with me; [14:31]  but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going. 

 [John 15] 


[15:1]  “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower. [15:2]  Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, so that it may bear more fruit. [15:3]  You are already clean because of the message that I have given you. [15:4]  Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me. [15:5]  I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remains united to me, while I remain united to you – you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me. [15:6]  If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt. [15:7]  If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours. [15:8]  It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honored. [15:9]  As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love. [15:10]  If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father’s commands to heart and remain in his love. [15:11]  I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete. [15:12]  This is my command – love one another, as I have loved you. [15:13]  No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends. [15:14]  And you are my friends, if you do what I command you. [15:15]  I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father. [15:16]  It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name. [15:17]  I am giving you these commands that you may love one another. [15:18]  If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me. [15:19]  If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you. [15:20]  Remember what I said to you – ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also. [15:21]  But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me. [15:22]  If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin. [15:23]  The person who hates me hates my Father also. [15:24]  If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. [15:25]  And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – ‘They hated me without cause.’ [15:26]  But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me; [15:27]  yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first. 

 [John 16] 

[16:1] “I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.[16:2]  They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God. [16:3]  They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me. [16:4]  But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself. [16:5]  I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – ‘Where are you going?’ [16:6]  Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you. [16:7]  Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you. [16:8]  And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment; [16:9]  as to sin, for people do not believe in me; [16:10]  as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer; [16:11]  as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned. [16:12]  I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now. [16:13]  Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come. [16:14]  He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you. [16:15]  Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you. [16:16]  In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.” 

[16:17] At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us  ‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’;  and by saying  ‘Because I am going to the Father’? [16:18] What does he mean by  ‘In a little while’?”  they said. “We do not know what he is speaking about.”[16:19] Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said,  “Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’? [16:20]  In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy. [16:21]  A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world. [16:22]  You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy. [16:23]  And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name. [16:24]  So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. [16:25]  I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly. [16:26]  You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you; [16:27]  for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father. [16:28]  I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.” 

[16:29] “At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.[16:30] Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.”

[16:31]  “Do you believe that already?”  Jesus answered.[16:32]  “Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. [16:33]  I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.” 

 [John 17] 


[17:1] After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heaven-wards, and said:

|   “Father, the hour has come; honor your Son, so that your Son may honor you; [17:2]  even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to all those whom you has given him. [17:3]  And the eternal life is this – to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you has sent as your messenger. [17:4]  I have honored you on earth by completing the work which you has given me to do; [17:5]  and now do you honor me, Father, at your own side, with the honor which I had at your side before the world began. [17:6]  I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart. [17:7]  They recognize now that everything that you gave me was from you; [17:8]  for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you has sent me as your messenger. [17:9]  I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you has given me, for they are your own – [17:10]  All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine – and I am honored in them. [17:11]  Now I am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world, and I am to come to you. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of your name which you has given me, so that they may be one, as we are. [17:12]  Whilst I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul – in fulfillment of scripture. [17:13]  But now I am to come to you; and I am speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts. [17:14]  I have given them your message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world. [17:15]  I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil. [17:16]  They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world. [17:17]  Consecrate them by the truth; your message is truth. [17:18]  Just as you has sent me as your messenger to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world. [17:19]  And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated. [17:20]  But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message, [17:21]  that they all may be one – that as you, Father, are in union with us – and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger. [17:22]  I have given them the honor which you has given me, so that they may be one as we are one – [17:23]  I in union with them and you with me – that so they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me. [17:24]  Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for thou did love me before the beginning of the world. [17:25]  Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger. [17:26]  I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.” 

 [John 18] 


[18:1] When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the brook Kedron to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.[18:2] The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.[18:3] So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some police officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.[18:4] Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them,  “For whom are you looking?” 

[18:5] “Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer.  “I am he,”  said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)[18:6] When Jesus said  ‘I am he,’  they drew back and fell to the ground.[18:7] So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”

[18:8]  “I have already told you that I am he,”  replied Jesus,  “so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.” [18:9] This was in fulfillment of his words –  ‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’ [18:10] At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.[18:11] But Jesus said to Peter,  “Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?” 

[18:12] So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish police, arrested Jesus and bound him,[18:13] and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.[18:14] It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.[18:15] Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,[18:16] while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.[18:17] So the maidservant said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?”

“No, I am not,” he said.[18:18] The servants and police officers were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.[18:19] The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.[18:20]  “For my part,”  answered Jesus,  “I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret. [18:21]  Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.” [18:22] When Jesus said this, one of the police officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.[18:23]  “If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,”  replied Jesus,  “but if not, why do you strike me?” [18:24] Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.[18:25] Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.[18:26] One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?”[18:27] Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.

[18:28] From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.[18:29] Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.[18:30] “If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.[18:31] “Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.”

“We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied –[18:32] In fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.[18:33] After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”

[18:34]  “Do you ask me that yourself?”  replied Jesus,  “or did others say it to you about me?” 

[18:35] “Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?”

[18:36]  “My kingly power,”  replied Jesus,  “is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.” 

[18:37] “So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate.  “Yes, it is true I am a king,”  answered Jesus.  “I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.” 

[18:38] “What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.[18:39] It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”

[18:40] “No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.

 [John 19] 


[19:1] After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.[19:2] The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.[19:3] They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.[19:4] Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”[19:5] Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”[19:6] When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”

“Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.”

[19:7] “But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”[19:8] When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;[19:9] and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”[19:10] But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”

[19:11]  “You would have no power over me at all,”  answered Jesus,  “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.” [19:12] This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”[19:13] On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’[19:14] It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”[19:15] At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”

“What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests;[19:16] so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.

So they took Jesus;[19:17] and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.[19:18] There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.[19:19] Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’[19:20] These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.[19:21] The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”[19:22] But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”

[19:23] When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.[19:24] So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture –

|  ‘They shared my clothes among them,
|    And over my clothing they cast lots.’

That was what the soldiers did.[19:25] Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.[19:26] When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother,  “There is your son.” [19:27] Then he said to that disciple,  “There is your mother.”  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.

[19:28] Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture,  “I am thirsty.” [19:29] There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.[19:30] When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed,  “All is finished!”  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.[19:31] It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.[19:32] Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;[19:33] but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.[19:34] One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.[19:35] This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.[19:36] For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’[19:37] And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’[19:38] After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.[19:39] Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.[19:40] They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.[19:41] At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.[19:42] And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.

 [John 20] 

##### The Risen Life #####

[20:1] On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.[20:2] So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”[20:3] So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.[20:4] The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.[20:5] Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.[20:6] Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,[20:7] and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.[20:8] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.[20:9] For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.[20:10] The disciples then returned to their companions.

[20:11] Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,[20:12] and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.[20:13] “Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”[20:14] After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.[20:15]  “Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.”

[20:16]  “Mary!”  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).[20:17]  “Do not hold me,”  Jesus said,  “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.” [20:18] Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.

[20:19] In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  “Peace be with you”; [20:20] after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.[20:21] Again Jesus said to them,  “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.” [20:22] After saying this, he breathed on them, and said,  “Receive the Holy Spirit; [20:23]  if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.” 

[20:24] But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came;[20:25] so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!”

“Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,” he exclaimed, “and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”[20:26] A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said,  “Peace be with you.” [20:27] Then he said to Thomas,  “Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.” [20:28] And Thomas exclaimed, “My Master, and my God!”

[20:29]  “Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?”  said Jesus.  “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!” 

[20:30] There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;[20:31] but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.

 [John 21] 


[21:1] Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.[21:2] It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,[21:3] “I am going fishing.”

“We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.[21:4] Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.[21:5]  “My children,”  he said,  “have you anything to eat?” 

“No,” they answered.[21:6]  “Cast your net to the right of the boat,”  he said,  “and you will find fish.”  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.[21:7] The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.[21:8] But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.[21:9] When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.[21:10]  “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”  said Jesus.[21:11] So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.[21:12]  “Come and have breakfast.” , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.[21:13] Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.[21:14] This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.

[21:15] When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?” 

“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”

 “Feed my lambs,”  said Jesus.[21:16] Then, a second time, Jesus asked,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” 

“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”

 “Tend my sheep,”  said Jesus.[21:17] The third time, Jesus said to him,  “Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.”

 “Feed my sheep,”  said Jesus.[21:18]  “In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.” [21:19] Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added,  “Follow me.” [21:20] Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.[21:21] Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?”

[21:22]  “If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”  answered Jesus,  “what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.” [21:23] So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said  “If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?” 

[21:24] It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.

[21:25] There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.

 [Acts 1] 

[1:1] 

### The Church and the Jews ###

##### The Acts of the Apostles Peter and John #####

The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,[1:2] down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.[1:3] With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.[1:4] And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise –  “that promise,”  he said,  “of which you have heard me speak; [1:5]  for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.” 

[1:6] So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question – “Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?”[1:7] His answer was,  “It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision; [1:8]  but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” 

[1:9] No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.[1:10] While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,[1:11] and said, “People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.”

[1:12] Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.[1:13] When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.[1:14] They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

[1:15] About this time, at a meeting of the Lord’s followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.[1:16] “Friends,” he said, “it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus,[1:17] for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.”[1:18] (This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.[1:19] This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, ‘Akeldama,’ which means the ‘Field of Blood.’)

[1:20] “For in the book of Psalms,” Peter continued, “it is said –

|  ‘Let his home become desolate,
|  And let no one live in it’;

and also –

|  ‘His office let another take.’

[1:21] Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us –[1:22] from his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us – someone must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.”[1:23] So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;[1:24] and they offered this prayer –

|  “Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen[1:25] to take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.”

[1:26] Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.

 [Acts 2] 


[2:1] In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,[2:2] when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.[2:3] Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;[2:4] and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.

[2:5] Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;[2:6] and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.[2:7] They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, “What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?[2:8] Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?[2:9] Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,[2:10] in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,[2:11] either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians – yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.”[2:12] They were all utterly amazed and bewildered.

“What does it mean?” they asked one another.[2:13] But there were some who said with a sneer, “They have had too much new wine.”

[2:14] Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.[2:15] These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No![2:16] This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel –

|  [2:17] ‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says,
|    ‘That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity;
|  Your sons and your daughters will become prophets,
|  Your young men will see visions,
|  And your old men dream dreams;
|    [2:18] Yes, even on the slaves – for they are mine – both men and women,
|    I will in those days pour out my Spirit,
|      And they will become prophets;
|  [2:19] And I will show wonders in the heavens above,
|  And signs on the earth below –
|    Blood and fire and mist of smoke;
|  [2:20] The sun will become darkness,
|  And the moon blood-red,
|    Before the day of the Lord comes – that great and awful day.
|      [2:21] Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’

[2:22] People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well –[2:23] He, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.[2:24] But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.[2:25] Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said –

|  ‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,
|    For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted.
|  [2:26] Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;
|    Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;
|  [2:27] For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,
|    Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.
|  [2:28] You have shown me the path to life,
|    You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’

[2:29] Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.[2:30] David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future,[2:31] and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption.[2:32] It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.[2:33] And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.[2:34] It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says –

|  ‘The Lord said to my master, “Sit on my right hand,
|  [2:35] Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.”’

[2:36] So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ – this Jesus whom you crucified.”

[2:37] When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Friends, what can we do?”

[2:38] “Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.[2:39] For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.”

[2:40] Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them – “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”[2:41] So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.[2:42] They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.

[2:43] A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.[2:44] All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;[2:45] they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.[2:46] Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.[2:47] And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.

 [Acts 3] 


[3:1] One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o’clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by.[3:2] This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called ‘the Beautiful Gate,’ to beg of those who went in.[3:3] Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.[3:4] Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, “Look at us.”

[3:5] The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;[3:6] but Peter added, “I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.”[3:7] Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong,[3:8] and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.[3:9] All the people saw him walking about and praising God;[3:10] and, when they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.[3:11] While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered around them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.

[3:12] On seeing this, Peter said to the people, “People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?[3:13] The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honor to his servant Jesus – him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.[3:14] You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer![3:15] The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead – and of that we are ourselves witnesses.[3:16] And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has – by his name – been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.[3:17] And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.[3:18] But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.[3:19] Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,[3:20] and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.[3:21] But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.[3:22] Moses himself said –

|  ‘The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.[3:23] And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.’

[3:24] Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.[3:25] You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham –

|  ‘In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed.’

[3:26] For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.”

 [Acts 4] 

[4:1] While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,[4:2] much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.[4:3] They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.[4:4] Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.

[4:5] The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem.[4:6] There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.[4:7] They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them.

“By what power,” they asked, “Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?”

[4:8] Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, “Leaders of the people and elders,[4:9] since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,[4:10] let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead – it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.[4:11] Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’[4:12] And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.”

[4:13] When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.[4:14] But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.[4:15] So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.

[4:16] “What are we to do to these men?” they asked one another. “That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.[4:17] But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.”

[4:18] So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.

[4:19] But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him –[4:20] judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.”[4:21] However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;[4:22] for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.

[4:23] After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.[4:24] All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer:

|  “Sovereign Lord, it is you who has made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,[4:25] and who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said –
|    ‘Why did the nations rage,
|      and the peoples form vain designs?
|    [4:26] The kings of the earth set their array,
|    and its rulers gathered together,
|      against the Lord and against his Christ.’
|  [4:27] There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides –[4:28] Yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.[4:29] Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,[4:30] while you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”

[4:31] When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly.

[4:32] The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.[4:33] The apostles continued with great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s blessing rested on them all abundantly.[4:34] Nor was there anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales[4:35] And laid them at the apostles’ feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his wants.[4:36] A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from the apostles the additional name of ‘Barnabas’ – which means ‘The Consoler,’)[4:37] Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

 [Acts 5] 


[5:1] There was, however, a man named Ananias, who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property,[5:2] and, with her connivance, kept back some of the proceeds. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

[5:3] “Ananias,” Peter exclaimed, “how is it that Satan has so taken possession of your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit, and kept back a part of the money paid for the land?[5:4] While it was unsold, was not it your own? And after it was sold, was not the money at your own disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not to people, but to God!”

[5:5] As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and everyone who heard of it was appalled.[5:6] The young men got up, and, winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it.

[5:7] After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.[5:8] “Is it true,” Peter asked, addressing her, “that you sold your land for such a sum?”

“Yes,” she answered, “we did.”[5:9] Then Peter said, “How did you come to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door; and they will carry you out too.”

[5:10] Instantly Sapphira fell down at Peter’s feet and expired. On coming in, the young men found her dead; so they carried her out and buried her by her husband’s side.[5:11] The whole church and all who heard of these events were appalled.

[5:12] Many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people, through the instrumentality of the apostles, whose custom it was to meet all together in the Colonnade of Solomon;[5:13] but of the rest no one ventured to join them. On the other hand, the people were full of their praise,[5:14] and still larger numbers, both of men and women, as they became believers in the Lord, were added to their number.[5:15] The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on someone of them.[5:16] Besides this, the inhabitants of the towns around Jerusalem flocked into the city, bringing with them their sick and those who were troubled by foul spirits; and they were cured everyone.

[5:17] At this the high priest was roused to action, and he and all his supporters (who formed the party of the Sadducees), moved by jealousy,[5:18] arrested the apostles, and had them placed in custody.[5:19] An angel of the Lord, however, opened the prison doors at night and led them out.[5:20] “Go,” he said, “and stand in the Temple Courts, and tell the people the whole message of this new life.”[5:21] When they heard this, they went at daybreak into the Temple Courts, and began to teach. The high priest and his party, on their arrival, summoned the High Council, including all the leaders of the people among the Israelites, and sent to the jail to fetch the apostles.[5:22] But, when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported that,[5:23] while they had found the goal barred securely and the guards posted at the doors, yet, on opening them, they had not found anyone inside.[5:24] When the officer in charge at the Temple and the chief priests heard their story, they were perplexed about the apostles and as to what all this would lead to.[5:25] Presently, however, someone came and told them, that the men whom they had put in prison were actually standing in the Temple Courts, teaching the people.[5:26] Then, the officer went with his men and fetched the apostles – without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people –[5:27] And then brought them before the Council. The high priest demanded an explanation from them.

[5:28] “We gave you strict orders,” he said, “not to teach in this name. Yet you have actually flooded Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to make us responsible for the death of this man.”

[5:29] To this Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.[5:30] The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you put to death by hanging him on a cross.[5:31] It is this Jesus whom God has exalted to his right hand, to be a guide and a Savior, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.[5:32] And we are witness to the truth of this, and so is the Holy Spirit – the gift of God to those who obey him.”

[5:33] The members of the Council became frantic with rage on hearing this, and were for putting the apostles to death.[5:34] But Gamaliel, a Pharisee, who was a Doctor of the Law and who was held in universal respect, rose in the Council, and directed that the men should be taken out of court for a little while.

[5:35] He then said, “People of Israel, take care as to what you intend to do with these men.[5:36] For not long ago Theudas appeared, professing to be somebody, and was joined by a body of some four hundred men. But he was killed; and all his followers scattered and dwindled away.[5:37] After him, Judas the Galilean appeared at the time of the census, and induced people to follow him; Yet he, too, perished and all his followers were dispersed.[5:38] And, in this present case, my advice to you is not to interfere with these men, but to leave them alone, for, if their designs and their work are merely of human origin, they will come to an end;[5:39] but, if they are of divine origin, you will be powerless to put an end to them – or else you may find yourselves fighting against God!”

[5:40] The Council followed his advice, and, calling the apostles in, had them flogged, and then, after cautioning them not to speak in the name of Jesus, set them free.[5:41] But the apostles left the Council, rejoicing that they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for that name;[5:42] and never for a single day, either in the Temple Courts or in private houses, did they cease to teach, or to tell the good news of Jesus, the Christ.

 [Acts 6] 


[6:1] About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.[6:2] The Twelve, therefore, called together the general body of the disciples and said to them, “It is not well for us to see to the distribution at the tables and neglect God’s message.[6:3] Therefore, friends, look for seven men of reputation among yourselves, wise and spiritually-minded men, and we will appoint them to attend to this matter;[6:4] while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the delivery of the message.”

[6:5] This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose Stephen – a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit – and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former convert to Judaism;[6:6] and they brought these men to the apostles, who, after praying, placed their hands on them.

[6:7] So God’s message spread, and the number of the disciples continued to increase rapidly in Jerusalem, and a large body of the priests accepted the faith.

[6:8] Meanwhile Stephen, divinely helped and strengthened, was showing great wonders and signs among the people.[6:9] But some members of the Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and Visitors from Cilicia and Roman Asia, were roused to action and began disputing with Stephen;[6:10] yet they were quite unable to withstand the wisdom and the inspiration with which he spoke.[6:11] Then they induced some men to assert that they had heard Stephen saying blasphemous things against Moses, and against God;[6:12] and they stirred up the people, as well as the elders and the teachers of the Law, and set on Stephen, and arrested him, and brought him before the High Council.[6:13] There they produced witnesses who gave false evidence.

“This man,” they said, “is incessantly saying things against this Holy place and the Law;[6:14] indeed, we have heard him declare that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the customs handed down to us by Moses.”[6:15] The eyes of all the members of the Council were riveted on Stephen, and they saw his face looking like the face of an angel.

 [Acts 7] 

[7:1] Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”[7:2] Stephen replied, “Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him –[7:3] ‘Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.’[7:4] And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.[7:5] God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.[7:6] God’s words were these – ‘Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.[7:7] But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,’ God said, ‘and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.’[7:8] Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.[7:9] The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,[7:10] and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.[7:11] Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.[7:12] Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.[7:13] In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.[7:14] Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all;[7:15] and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,[7:16] and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.[7:17] As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,[7:18] until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.[7:19] This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.[7:20] It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father’s house;[7:21] and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.[7:22] So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.[7:23] When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;[7:24] and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.[7:25] He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.[7:26] The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?’[7:27] But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying – ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?[7:28] Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?’[7:29] At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.[7:30] Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.[7:31] When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say –[7:32] ‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.[7:33] Then the Lord said to him – ‘Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.[7:34] I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.’[7:35] This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words – ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.[7:36] He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.[7:37] This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel – ‘God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.’[7:38] He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you.[7:39] Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,[7:40] while they said to Aaron – ‘Make us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’[7:41] That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honor of their own handiwork![7:42] So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets –

|  ‘Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel,
|    all those forty years in the desert?
|  [7:43] You took with you the tent where Moloch is worshiped
|  and the star of the god Rephan –
|    the images which you had made to worship.
|      Therefore I will exile you beyond Babylon.’

[7:44] Our ancestors had the tent where they worshiped God in the desert, constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it, after the model which he had seen.[7:45] This tent, which was handed down to them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their advance), and remained here until the time of David.[7:46] David found favor with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place to reside.[7:47] But it was Solomon who built a house for God.[7:48] Yet it is not in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet says –

|  [7:49] ‘The heavens are a throne for me,
|    and the earth a stool for my feet.
|  What manner of house will you build me, asks the Lord,
|    or what place is there where I may rest?
|      [7:50] Was it not my hand that made all these things?’

[7:51] Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.[7:52] Which of the prophets escaped persecution at their hands? They killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one; of whom you, in your turn, have now become the betrayers and murderers –[7:53] You who received the Law as transmitted by angels and yet failed to keep it.”

[7:54] As they listened to this, the Council grew frantic with rage, and gnashed their teeth at Stephen.[7:55] He, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes intently on the heavens, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right hand.

[7:56] “Look,” he exclaimed, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right hand!”[7:57] At this, with a loud shout, they stopped their ears and all rushed on him, forced him outside the city,[7:58] and began to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.[7:59] And they stoned Stephen, while he cried to the Lord, “Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!”[7:60] Falling on his knees, he called out loudly, “Lord! Do not charge them with this sin;” and with these words he fell asleep.

 [Acts 8] 

[8:1] Saul approved of his being put to death.

On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.[8:2] Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him.[8:3] But Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house, dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison.

[8:4] Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news.[8:5] Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ.[8:6] The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working.[8:7] For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them;[8:8] and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city.[8:9] There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being.[8:10] Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. ‘This man,’ they used to say, ‘must be that power of God which people call “The Great Power.”’[8:11] And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts.[8:12] However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.[8:13] Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring.

[8:14] When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them;[8:15] and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.[8:16] (As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus).[8:17] Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

[8:18] When Simon saw that it was through the placing of the apostles’ hands on them that the Spirit was given, he brought them a sum of money and said,[8:19] “Give me also this power of yours, so that, if I place my hands on anyone, he may receive the Holy Spirit.”

[8:20] “A curse on you and on your money,” Peter exclaimed, “for thinking that God’s free gift can be bought with gold![8:21] You have no share or part in our message, for your heart is not right with God.[8:22] Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, that, if possible, you may be forgiven for such a thought;[8:23] for I see that you have fallen into the bitterness of envy and the fetters of sin.”

[8:24] “Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,” Simon answered, “so that none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.”

[8:25] Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the Lord’s message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they went, in many Samaritan villages.

[8:26] Meanwhile an angel of the Lord had said to Philip, “Set out on a journey southwards, along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (It is now deserted).[8:27] So Philip set out on a journey; and on his way he came on an official of high rank, in the service of Candace, Queen of the Abyssinians. He was her treasurer, and had been to Jerusalem to worship,[8:28] and was now on his way home, sitting in his carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah.

[8:29] The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up to the carriage over there and keep close to it.”[8:30] So Philip ran up, and he heard the Abyssinian reading the prophet Isaiah.

“Do you understand what you are reading?” he asked.[8:31] “How can I,” the other answered, “unless someone will explain it to me?” and he invited Philip to get up and sit by his side.[8:32] The passage of scripture which he was reading was this –

|  ‘Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter,
|    and as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer,
|    so he refrains from opening his lips.
|  [8:33] He was humiliated and justice was denied him.
|  Who will tell the story of his generation?
|    For his life is cut off from earth.’

[8:34] “Now,” said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, “tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?”[8:35] Then Philip began, and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about Jesus.

[8:36] Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, “Look! Here is water; what is to prevent my being baptized?”[8:37] ^[ 8:37 Some later manuscripts add: Philip said, “If you believe with your whole heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”][8:38] So he ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water – both Philip and the Treasurer – and Philip baptized him.[8:39] But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful heart.[8:40] But Philip was found at Ashdod, and, as he went on his way, he told the good news in all the towns through which he passed, until he came to Caesarea.

 [Acts 9] 


[9:1] Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,[9:2] and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorizing him, if he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.

[9:3] While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.[9:4] He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him –  “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” 

[9:5] “Who are you, Lord?” he asked.

 “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”  the voice answered;[9:6]  “Yet stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” 

[9:7] The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one.[9:8] When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;[9:9] and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.

[9:10] Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said,  “Ananias.” 

“Yes, Lord,” he answered.[9:11]  “Go at once,”  said the Lord,  “to the Straight Street, and ask at Judas’s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying, [9:12]  and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.” 

[9:13] “Lord,” exclaimed Ananias, “I have heard from many people about this man – how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.[9:14] And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.”[9:15] But the Lord said to him,  “Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel. [9:16]  I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.” 

[9:17] So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said, “Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord – by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here – so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”[9:18] Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,[9:19] and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return.

Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,[9:20] and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.[9:21] All who heard him were amazed.

“Is not this,” they asked, “the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?”[9:22] Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.

[9:23] After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,[9:24] but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him;[9:25] but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.

[9:26] On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.[9:27] Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.[9:28] After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,[9:29] talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.[9:30] But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.

[9:31] And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.

[9:32] Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda.[9:33] There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.[9:34] “Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.” Aeneas got up at once;[9:35] and all the inhabitants of Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord’s side.

[9:36] At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek ‘Dorcas’ – a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.[9:37] Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room.[9:38] Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.[9:39] Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came around him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them.[9:40] But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha! Stand up.”

She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.[9:41] Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ’s people, presented her to them alive.[9:42] This became known all through Jaffa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord.[9:43] And Peter stayed some days at Jaffa with a tanner named Simon.

 [Acts 10] 


[10:1] At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a captain in the regiment known as the ‘Italian Regiment,’[10:2] A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.[10:3] One afternoon, about three o’clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.[10:4] Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said, “What is it, Lord?”

“Your prayers and your charities,” the angel answered, “have been an acceptable offering to God.[10:5] And now, send messengers to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.[10:6] He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.”

[10:7] When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,[10:8] and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Jaffa.

[10:9] On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray.[10:10] He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,[10:11] and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.[10:12] In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.[10:13] Then he was aware of a voice which said –  “Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.” 

[10:14] “No, Lord, I cannot,” answered Peter, “for I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.”[10:15] Again he was aware of a voice which said –  “What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.” [10:16] This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens.

[10:17] While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon’s house, came up to the gate,[10:18] and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.[10:19] Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, “There are two men looking for you at this moment.[10:20] Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”

[10:21] Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the person you are looking for. What is your reason for coming?”

[10:22] The men replied, “Our captain, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.”[10:23] So Peter invited them in and entertained them.

The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Lord’s followers from Jaffa;[10:24] and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relatives and intimate friends to meet them.[10:25] So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter’s feet, bowed to the ground.[10:26] Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, “Stand up, I am only human like yourself.”

[10:27] Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said,[10:28] “You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean.[10:29] That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.”

[10:30] “Just three days ago this very hour,” Cornelius said, “I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.[10:31] ‘Cornelius,’ he said, ‘your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.[10:32] Therefore send to Jaffa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.’[10:33] Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.”[10:34] Then Peter began.

“I see, beyond all doubt,” he said, “that God does not show partiality,[10:35] but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.[10:36] God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace – and Jesus is Lord of all![10:37] You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning form Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed –[10:38] The story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.[10:39] We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross![10:40] This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,[10:41] not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God – to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.[10:42] Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead.[10:43] To him it is that all the prophets bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives through his name forgiveness of sins.”

[10:44] Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.[10:45] Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even on the Gentiles;[10:46] for they heard them speaking in different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked,[10:47] “Can anyone refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?”[10:48] And he directed that they should be baptized in the faith of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer.

 [Acts 11] 


[11:1] The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God’s message.[11:2] But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him,[11:3] on the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had taken meals with them.[11:4] So Peter began to relate the facts to them as they had occurred.[11:5] “I was in the town of Jaffa,” he said, “and was praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the heavens; and it came right down to me.[11:6] Looking intently at it, I began to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds;[11:7] and I also heard a voice saying to me –  ‘Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat.’ [11:8] ‘No, Lord, I cannot,’ I answered, ‘for nothing defiled or unclean has ever passed my lips.’[11:9] Then a second time there came a voice from the heavens.  ‘What God has pronounced clean’,  it said,  ‘you must not call defiled.’ [11:10] This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens.[11:11] At that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were.[11:12] The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also went with me. And, when we came into the man’s house,[11:13] he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to him – ‘Send to Jaffa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter;[11:14] for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to you and all your household.’[11:15] I had but just begun to speak,” continued Peter, “when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the first;[11:16] and I recalled the saying of the Master –  ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ [11:17] Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master – who was I that I could thwart God?”

[11:18] On hearing this statement, they said no more, but broke out into praise of God. “So even to the Gentiles,” they exclaimed, “God has granted the repentance which leads to life!”

[11:19] Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message – but only to Jews.[11:20] Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus.[11:21] The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord’s side.[11:22] The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.[11:23] On coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to the Lord –[11:24] For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith – and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord’s side.[11:25] Afterward Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul;[11:26] and, when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And so it came about that, for a whole year, they attended the meetings of the church there, and taught a large number of people; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called ‘Christians.’

[11:27] During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem.[11:28] One of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world – a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius.[11:29] So the disciples, without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send something to help the followers living in Judea.[11:30] And this they did, sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul.

 [Acts 12] 


[12:1] It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the members of the church.[12:2] He had James, the brother of John, beheaded;[12:3] and, when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.)[12:4] After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the Passover, to bring him up before the people.[12:5] So Peter was kept in prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly offered to God on his behalf.[12:6] Just when Herod was intending to bring him before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of the door, guarding the prison.[12:7] Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side, and roused him with the words, “Get up quickly.”[12:8] The chains dropped from his wrists, and then the angel said, “Put on your belt and sandals.” When Peter had done so, the angel added, “Throw your cloak around you and follow me.”

[12:9] Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under the angel’s guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision.[12:10] Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once the angel left him.

[12:11] Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know beyond all doubt that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod’s hands and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.”[12:12] As soon as he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered together, praying.[12:13] On his knocking at the door in the gate, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it.[12:14] She recognized Peter’s voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them that Peter was standing outside.

[12:15] “You are mad!” they exclaimed. But, when she persisted that it was so, they said, “It must be his spirit!”

[12:16] Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed.[12:17] Peter signed to them with his hand to be silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, adding, “Tell James and the others all this.” Then he left the house, and went away to another place.

[12:18] In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers – what could have become of Peter![12:19] And, when Herod had made further search for him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at Caesarea.

[12:20] It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king’s for its food supply.[12:21] On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes, seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration.[12:22] The people kept shouting, “It is the voice of God, and not of a person!”

[12:23] Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died.[12:24] Meanwhile the Lord’s message kept extending, and spreading far and wide.

[12:25] When Barnabas and Saul had carried out their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, and took with them John, who was also known as Mark.

 [Acts 13] 

[13:1] 

### The Church and the Gentiles ###

##### Acts of the Apostle Paul #####

Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several prophets and teachers – Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of ‘Black’, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and Saul.[13:2] While they were engaged in the worship of the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.”[13:3] Accordingly, after fasting and prayer, they placed their hands on them and dismissed them.

[13:4] Barnabas and Saul, sent on this mission, as they were, by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.[13:5] On reaching Salamis, they began to tell the message of God in the Jewish synagogues; and they had John with them as an assistant.[13:6] After passing through the whole island, they reached Paphos, where they found an astrologer who pretended to be a prophet – a Jew by birth, whose name was Barjoshua.[13:7] He was at the court of the Governor, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked to be told God’s message.[13:8] But Elymas, the astrologer (for that is the meaning of the word), opposed them, eager to divert the Governor’s attention from the faith.[13:9] However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him and said,[13:10] “You incarnation of deceit and all fraud! You son of the devil! You opponent of all that is good! Will you never cease to divert the straight paths of the Lord? Listen![13:11] The hand of the Lord is on you even now, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the sun.” Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went feeling about for someone to guide him.[13:12] When the Governor saw what had happened, he became a believer in Christ, being greatly impressed by the teaching about the Lord.

[13:13] After this, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and went to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.[13:14] The others went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and took their seats.[13:15] After the reading of the Law and the prophets, the synagogue leader sent them this message – “Friends, if you have any helpful words to address to the people, now is the time to speak.”[13:16] So Paul rose and, motioning with his hand, said:

“People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to say.[13:17] The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land.[13:18] For about forty years he bore with them in the desert;[13:19] then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people –[13:20] For about four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of whom the prophet Samuel was the last.[13:21] And, when they demanded a king, God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.[13:22] After removing him, he raised David to the throne, and bore this testimony to him – ‘In David, the son of Jesse, I have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my purposes.’[13:23] It was from this man’s descendants that God, in accordance with his promise, gave Israel a Savior – Jesus;[13:24] John having first proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for all the people of Israel.[13:25] As John was drawing towards the end of his career, he said ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But there is “one coming” after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.’[13:26] Brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, and all those among you who worship God, it was to us that the message of this salvation was sent.[13:27] The people of Jerusalem and their leaders, failing to recognize Jesus, and not understanding the utterances of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.[13:28] They found no ground at all for putting him to death, and yet demanded his execution from Pilate;[13:29] and, after carrying out everything written about him, they took Jesus down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb.[13:30] But God raised him from the dead;[13:31] and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are now witnesses for him to the people.[13:32] We also have good news to tell you, about the promise made to our ancestors –[13:33] That our children have had this promise completely fulfilled to them by God, by his raising Jesus. That is just what is said in the second Psalm –

|  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father.’

[13:34] As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to corruption, this is what is said –

|  ‘I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;’

[13:35] And, therefore, in another Psalm it is said –

|  ‘You will not give up the Holy One to undergo corruption.’

[13:36] David, after obediently doing God’s will in his own time, fell asleep and was laid by the side of his ancestors, and did undergo corruption;[13:37] but Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, did not undergo corruption.[13:38] I would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,[13:39] and that, in union with him, everyone who believes in him is absolved from every sin from which under the Law of Moses you could not be absolved.[13:40] Beware, therefore, that what is said in the prophets does not come true of you –

|  [13:41] ‘Look, you despisers, and wonder, and perish;
|  for I am doing a deed in your days –
|    a deed which, though told you in full, you will never believe’.”

[13:42] As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged for a repetition of this teaching on the next Sabbath.[13:43] After the congregation had dispersed, many of the Jews, and of the converts who joined in their worship, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue to rely on the loving kindness of God.

[13:44] On the following Sabbath, almost all the city gathered to hear God’s message.[13:45] But the sight of the crowds of people filled the minds of the Jews with jealousy, and they kept contradicting Paul’s statements in violent language.[13:46] Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out fearlessly, and said:

“It was necessary that the message of God should be told to you first; but, since you reject it and reckon yourselves not worthy of the eternal life – we turn to the Gentiles![13:47] For this is the Lord’s command to us –

|  ‘I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles,
|  a means of salvation to the ends of the earth’.”

[13:48] On hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and extolled God’s message; and all those who had been enrolled for eternal life became believers in Christ;[13:49] and the Lord’s message was carried throughout that district.[13:50] But the Jews incited the women of high social standing who worshiped with them, and the leading men of the town, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.[13:51] They, however, shook the dust off their feet in protest,[13:52] and went to Iconium, leaving the disciples full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.

 [Acts 14] 


[14:1] The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ.[14:2] But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the Lord’s followers.[14:3] Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there, and spoke out fearlessly, relying on the Lord, who confirmed the message of his love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their hands.[14:4] But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some with the apostles;[14:5] and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to stone them,[14:6] the apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district around,[14:7] and there they continued to tell the good news.

[14:8] In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked.[14:9] This man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,[14:10] said loudly, “Stand upright on your feet.”

The man leaped up, and began walking about,[14:11] and the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language, “The Gods have come down to us in human form.”[14:12] So they called Barnabas ‘Zeus,’ and Paul ‘Hermes,’ because he took the lead in speaking;[14:13] and the priest of Zeus-beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices.[14:14] But, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd.

“Friends, why are you doing this?” they shouted.[14:15] “We are only people like yourselves, and we have come with the good news that you should turn away from these follies to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.[14:16] In bygone times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways.[14:17] Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself – sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.”[14:18] Even with this appeal they could hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them.

[14:19] Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead.[14:20] But, when the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.[14:21] After telling the good news throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,[14:22] reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God.[14:23] They also appointed elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe.[14:24] Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia,[14:25] and, after telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia.[14:26] From there they sailed to Antioch – the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished.[14:27] After their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith;[14:28] and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time.

 [Acts 15] 


[15:1] But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord’s followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved.[15:2] This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion.

[15:3] The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers.[15:4] On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.[15:5] Some of the Pharisees’ party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.[15:6] The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question.[15:7] After much discussion, Peter rose and said:

“You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out – that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ.[15:8] Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.[15:9] He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.[15:10] Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear?[15:11] No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.”

[15:12] Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them.[15:13] After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council.

“Friends,” he began, “hear what I have to say.[15:14] Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his name.[15:15] And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say –

|  [15:16] ‘After this I will return;
|  And I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen –
|  Its ruins I will rebuild,
|    And will set it up once more;
|  [15:17] That so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord –
|  Even all the Gentiles on whom my name has been bestowed.
|    [15:18] Says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago.’

[15:19] In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God,[15:20] but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood.[15:21] For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.”

[15:22] It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community.[15:23] They were bearers of the following letter –

|  ‘The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.[15:24] As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds – without instructions from us –[15:25] We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,[15:26] who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.[15:27] We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.[15:28] We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions –[15:29] That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.’

[15:30] So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers,[15:31] and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents.[15:32] Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith.[15:33] After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them.[15:34] ^[ 15:34 Some later manuscripts add: But Silas decided to stay.]

[15:35] Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord’s message.[15:36] Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the Lord’s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord’s message, and see how they are prospering.”[15:37] Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;[15:38] but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.[15:39] This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,[15:40] while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,[15:41] started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith.

 [Acts 16] 

[16:1] Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek,[16:2] and who was well spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium.[16:3] Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.[16:4] As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe.

[16:5] So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.

[16:6] They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.[16:7] When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.[16:8] Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas;[16:9] and there one night Paul saw a vision. A Macedonian was standing and appealing to him – ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us.’[16:10] So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had summoned us to tell the good news to the people there.

[16:11] Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day.[16:12] From there we made our way to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and also a Roman Settlement.

In that city we spent several days.[16:13] On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.[16:14] Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman’s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul,[16:15] and, when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us to become her guests.

“Since you have shown your conviction,” she said, “that I really am a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she insisted on our doing so.

[16:16] One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her masters by fortune-telling.[16:17] This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, calling, “These men are servants of the most high God, and they are bringing you news of a way to salvation.”[16:18] She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.” That very moment the spirit left her.

[16:19] When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities,[16:20] and took them before the Magistrates.

“These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,” they complained;[16:21] “They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.”

[16:22] The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.[16:23] After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody.[16:24] On receiving so strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured their feet in the stocks.[16:25] About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening to them,[16:26] suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the prisoners’ chains were loosened.[16:27] Roused from his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped.[16:28] But Paul called our loudly, “Do not harm yourself; we are all here.”

[16:29] Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas.[16:30] Then he led them out, and said, “What must I do to be saved?”

[16:31] “Believe in Jesus, our Lord,” they replied, “and you will be saved, you and your household too.”[16:32] Then they spoke to him of God’s message, and to all his household as well.[16:33] And that very hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging to him were baptized without delay.[16:34] Afterward he took them up to his house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all his household, had come to believe in God.

[16:35] In the morning the Magistrates sent the police with an order for the men to be discharged.[16:36] The jailer told Paul of his instructions. “The Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,” he said, “so you had better leave the place at once and go quietly away.”

[16:37] But Paul’s answer to them was, “They have flogged us in public without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let them come and take us out themselves.”[16:38] The police reported his words to the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, were alarmed,[16:39] and went to the prison, and did their best to conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the city.[16:40] When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, and, after they had seen the Lord’s followers, and encouraged them, they left the place.

 [Acts 17] 


[17:1] After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;[17:2] and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.[17:3] He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ – this Jesus about whom I am telling you.”

[17:4] Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.[17:5] But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;[17:6] and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord’s followers before the city magistrates, shouting out,

“These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,[17:7] and have been harbored by Jason! They are all defying the decrees of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king – a man called Jesus!”

[17:8] On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;[17:9] and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.[17:10] That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.[17:11] These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.[17:12] As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.[17:13] But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.[17:14] The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.[17:15] The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.

[17:16] While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.[17:17] So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.[17:18] Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).[17:19] So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus.

“May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?[17:20] For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”[17:21] (All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)

[17:22] So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said – “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.[17:23] For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription – ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.[17:24] The God who made the world and all things that are in it – he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands,[17:25] neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.[17:26] He made all races of the earth’s surface – fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements –[17:27] That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;[17:28] for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets –

|  ‘His offspring, too, are we.’

[17:29] Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone – a work of human art and imagination.[17:30] True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,[17:31] because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed – and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.”

[17:32] On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.[17:33] And so Paul left the Court.[17:34] There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.

 [Acts 18] 

[18:1] On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.[18:2] There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,[18:3] and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them – their trade was tent-making.[18:4] Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.

[18:5] But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.[18:6] However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.”

[18:7] So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.[18:8] Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.[18:9] One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision,  “Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced; [18:10]  for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.” [18:11] So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people.

[18:12] While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,[18:13] charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law.[18:14] Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, “If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;[18:15] but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.”

[18:16] Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.[18:17] Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.

[18:18] Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.[18:19] They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.[18:20] When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,[18:21] as he took his leave, “I will come back again to you, please God,” and then set sail from Ephesus.[18:22] On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.[18:23] After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.

[18:24] Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.[18:25] He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.[18:26] This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still.[18:27] When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,[18:28] for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

 [Acts 19] 

[19:1] While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked,[19:2] “Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?”

“No,” they answered, “we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.”

[19:3] “What then was your baptism?” Paul asked.[19:4] “John’s baptism was a baptism on repentance,” rejoined Paul, “and John told the people (speaking of the ‘one coming’ after him) that they should believe in him – that is in Jesus.”

[19:5] On hearing this, they were baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus,[19:6] and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach.[19:7] There were about twelve of them in all.

[19:8] Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.[19:9] Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.[19:10] This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord’s message.

[19:11] God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul’s hands;[19:12] so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them.[19:13] An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them.

“I order you,” they would say, “by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.”[19:14] The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this;[19:15] but the wicked spirit answered them, “Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you – who are you?”

[19:16] Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them, mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded.[19:17] This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honor.[19:18] Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices;[19:19] while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins.[19:20] So irresistibly did the Lord’s message spread and prevail.

[19:21] Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. “And after I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”[19:22] So he sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Roman Asia.

[19:23] Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way.[19:24] A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans,[19:25] got these men together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and said:

“Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work,[19:26] and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at all.[19:27] So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendor – though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.”

[19:28] When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”[19:29] The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.[19:30] Paul wished to go into the amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him,[19:31] while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself inside.[19:32] Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing why they had met.[19:33] But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to show that he wanted to speak in their defense to the people.[19:34] However, when they recognized him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they continued shouting for two hours – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

[19:35] When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said, “People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis, and of the statue which fell down from Zeus?[19:36] As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash;[19:37] for you have brought these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor blasphemers of our Goddess.[19:38] If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal proceedings.[19:39] But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled in the regular Assembly.[19:40] For I tell you that we are in danger of being proceeded against for today’s riot, there being nothing to account for it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this disorderly gathering.”

[19:41] With these words he dismissed the Assembly.

 [Acts 20] 


[20:1] When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with encouraging words, bade them goodbye, and started on his journey to Macedonia.[20:2] After going through those districts and speaking many encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed three months.[20:3] He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he decided to return by way of Macedonia.[20:4] He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of Roman Asia.[20:5] These people went to Troas and waited for us there;[20:6] while we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week.

[20:7] On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight.[20:8] There were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met;[20:9] and a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked up for dead.[20:10] But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms around him.

“Do not be alarmed,” he said, “he is still alive.”[20:11] Then he went upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with them at great length until daybreak, and then left.[20:12] Meanwhile they had taken the lad away alive, and were greatly comforted.

[20:13] We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement, as he intended to go by land himself.[20:14] So, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.[20:15] The day after we had sailed from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day, and the next day reached Miletus;[20:16] for Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of the Harvest.

[20:17] From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church elders to meet him;[20:18] and, when they came, he said to them, “You know well the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set foot in Roman Asia,[20:19] serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of the Jewish leaders.[20:20] I never shrank from telling you anything that could be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private.[20:21] I earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord.[20:22] And now, under spiritual constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,[20:23] except that in town after town the Holy Spirit plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me.[20:24] But I count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus – which was to declare the good news of the love of God.[20:25] And now, I tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again – you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.[20:26] Therefore I declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the fate of any of you,[20:27] for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole purpose of God regarding you.[20:28] Be watchful over yourselves, and over the whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his life.[20:29] I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock;[20:30] and from among yourselves, too, people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw away the disciples after them.[20:31] Therefore, be on your guard, remembering how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to warn each one of you.[20:32] And now I commend you to the Lord and to the message of his love – a message which has the power to build up your characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become Christ’s people.[20:33] I have never coveted anyone’s gold or silver or clothing.[20:34] You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not only for my own wants, but for my companions also.[20:35] I left nothing undone to show you that, laboring as I labored, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself –  ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” [20:36] When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all.[20:37] All were in tears; and throwing their arms around Paul’s neck, they kissed him again and again,[20:38] grieving most of all over what he had said – that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.

 [Acts 21] 


[21:1] When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,[21:2] where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set sail.[21:3] After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.[21:4] There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.[21:5] However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed,[21:6] and then said goodbye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned home.

[21:7] After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and exchanged greetings with the followers there, and spent a day with them.[21:8] The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip, the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.[21:9] He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.[21:10] During our visit, which lasted several days, a prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.[21:11] He came to see us, and, taking Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands with it, said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says – ‘The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, and they will give him up to the Gentiles’.”[21:12] When we heard that, we and the people of the place began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

[21:13] It was then that Paul made the reply, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”[21:14] So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only adding – “The Lord’s will be done.”

[21:15] At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on our way up to Jerusalem.[21:16] Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing, with whom we were to stay.[21:17] On our arrival at Jerusalem, the followers of the Lord there gave us a hearty welcome;[21:18] and the next day Paul went with us to see James, and all the church elders were present.[21:19] After greeting them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts;[21:20] and, when they had heard it, they began praising God, and said to Paul:

“You see, brother, that those of our people who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law.[21:21] Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs.[21:22] Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest.[21:23] We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow.[21:24] Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.[21:25] As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.”

[21:26] Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification, and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on behalf of each of them.

[21:27] But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the Jewish people from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul and shouting,[21:28] “People of Israel! Help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our Law, and this place; and, what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this sacred place.”[21:29] (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in Paul’s company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had taken him into the Temple.)

[21:30] The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were immediately shut.[21:31] They were bent on killing him, when it was reported to the officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in commotion.[21:32] He instantly got together some officers and soldiers, and charged down on the crowd, who, when they saw the commanding officer and his soldiers, stopped beating Paul.[21:33] Then he went up to Paul, arrested him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he was, and what he had been doing.[21:34] Some of the crowd said one thing, and some another; and, as he could get no definite reply because of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.[21:35] When Paul reached the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the violence of the mob;[21:36] for the people were following in a mass, shouting out, “Kill him!”

[21:37] Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the commanding officer, “May I speak to you?”

“Do you know Greek?” asked the commanding officer.[21:38] “Aren’t you, then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the four thousand Bandits out into the wilderness?”

[21:39] “No,” said Paul, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city of some note. I beg you to give me permission to speak to the people.”

[21:40] The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew:

 [Acts 22] 

[22:1] “Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I am about to make.”[22:2] When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on:

[22:3] “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God’s service as any of you who are here today.[22:4] In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike –[22:5] And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.[22:6] While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all around me.[22:7] I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me  ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ [22:8] ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I replied. Then the voice said  ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’ [22:9] The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker’s voice.[22:10] Then I said ‘What am I to do, Lord?’  ‘Get up and go into Damascus,’  The Lord said to me,  ‘and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’ [22:11] In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus.[22:12] There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me.[22:13] Standing close to me, he said ‘Saul, my brother, recover your sight.’ And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him.[22:14] Then he said ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips;[22:15] for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard.[22:16] And now why wait any longer, Be baptized at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.’[22:17] After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance,[22:18] and saw Jesus saying to me  ‘Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’ [22:19] ‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you;[22:20] and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.’[22:21] But Jesus said to me  ‘Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away’.” 

[22:22] Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, “Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!”[22:23] As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air,[22:24] the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him.

[22:25] But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the captain standing near, “Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?”[22:26] On hearing this, the captain went and reported it to the commanding officer. “Do you know what you are doing?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”[22:27] So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”

“Yes,” replied Paul.[22:28] “I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,” said the officer. “I am one by birth,” rejoined Paul.

[22:29] The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains.

[22:30] On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them.

 [Acts 23] 

[23:1] Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began:

“Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.”[23:2] At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth;[23:3] Paul turned to him and said:

“God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?”[23:4] The people standing near said to Paul, “Do you know that you are insulting God’s high priest?”

[23:5] “I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,” said Paul, “for scripture says –

|  ‘Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill’.”

[23:6] Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.”

[23:7] As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.[23:8] (For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.)[23:9] So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested, “We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel…”[23:10] The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.

[23:11] That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said,  “Courage! You have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome also.” [23:12] In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.[23:13] There were more than forty in the plot;[23:14] and they went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul.[23:15] So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.”

[23:16] However, the son of Paul’s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it.[23:17] Paul called one of the Captains of the garrison and asked him to take the lad to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him.[23:18] The captain went with the lad to the commanding officer, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this lad to you, as he has something to tell you.”

[23:19] The commanding officer took the lad by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him.[23:20] “Some men have agreed,” answered the lad, “to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case.[23:21] But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.”[23:22] The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.[23:23] Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o’clock that night,[23:24] and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor.[23:25] He also wrote a letter along these lines:

|  [23:26] ‘Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the Governor.[23:27] The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen.[23:28] Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council,[23:29] when I found that their charges were connected with questions of their own Law, and that there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment.[23:30] Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you.’

[23:31] The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris;[23:32] and on the next day, leaving the troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort.[23:33] On arriving at Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought Paul before him.[23:34] As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he said,[23:35] “I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have arrived.” And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s Government house.

 [Acts 24] 


[24:1] Five days afterward the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul;[24:2] and, when the hearing came on, Tertullus began his speech for the prosecution.[24:3] “We owe it to your Excellency,” he said, “that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms – advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places.[24:4] But – not to be tedious – I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a brief statement of our case.[24:5] We have found this man a public pest; he is one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a ringleader of the Nazarene heretics.[24:6] He even attempted to desecrate the Temple itself, but we caught him;[24:7] ^[ 24:7 Some later manuscripts add: We wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias the commanding officer came and took him out of our hands by force, ordering his accusers to come before you.][24:8] and you will be able, by examining him on all these points, to satisfy yourself as to the charges which we are bringing against him.”

[24:9] The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his statements.[24:10] On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply:

“Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defense.[24:11] For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,[24:12] where my prosecutors never found me holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect – either in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city;[24:13] and they cannot establish the charges which they are now making against me.[24:14] This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets;[24:15] and I have a hope that rests in God – a hope which they also cherish – that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike.[24:16] This being so, I strive at all times to keep my conscience clear before both God and people.[24:17] After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;[24:18] and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.[24:19] There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me –[24:20] Or else let my opponents here say what they found wrong in me when I was before the Council,[24:21] except as to the one sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them – ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today’.”

[24:22] Felix, however, adjourned the case – though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way – with the promise, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.”[24:23] So he gave orders to the captain in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.

[24:24] Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in Christ Jesus.[24:25] But, while Paul was speaking at length about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified, and interrupted him – “Go for the present, but, when I find an opportunity, I will send for you again.”[24:26] He was hoping, too, for a bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with him.[24:27] But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left Paul a prisoner.

 [Acts 25] 


[25:1] Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem.[25:2] There the chief priests and the leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul,[25:3] and asked a favor of him, to Paul’s injury – to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the road.[25:4] But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.

[25:5] “So let the influential men among you,” he said, “go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.”[25:6] After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him.[25:7] On Paul’s appearance, the Jewish leaders who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious charges, which they failed to establish.[25:8] Paul’s answer to the charge was – ‘I have not committed any offense against the Jewish Law, or the Temple, or the Emperor.’[25:9] But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?”

[25:10] “No,” replied Paul, “I am standing at the Emperor’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware.[25:11] If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offense deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.”

[25:12] Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, “You have appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.”

[25:13] Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and paid a visit of congratulation to Festus;[25:14] and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king. “There is a man here,” he said, “left a prisoner by Felix,[25:15] about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an information, demanding judgment against him.[25:16] My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them.[25:17] So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.[25:18] But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected;[25:19] but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.[25:20] And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.[25:21] Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.”

[25:22] “I should like to hear this man myself,” Agrippa said to Festus.

“You will hear him tomorrow,” Festus answered.

[25:23] So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought before them.[25:24] Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all here present, you see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to be allowed to live.[25:25] I found, however, that he had not done anything deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I decided to send him.[25:26] But I have nothing definite to write about him to my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him, I may have something to write.[25:27] For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against him.”

 [Acts 26] 

[26:1] Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, “You are at liberty to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.[26:2] “I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,” he said, “that it is before you that I have to make my defense today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people,[26:3] especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.[26:4] My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;[26:5] and they have always known – if they choose to give evidence – that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.[26:6] Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial –[26:7] A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused – and by Jews themselves![26:8] Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?[26:9] I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;[26:10] and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.[26:11] Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.[26:12] It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,[26:13] that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all around me and those traveling with me.[26:14] We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew –  ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.’ [26:15] ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. And the Lord said,  ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; [26:16]  but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you, [26:17]  since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, [26:18]  to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God’s people, by faith in me.’ [26:19] After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;[26:20] on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.[26:21] This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.[26:22] However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike – without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen –[26:23] That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.”

[26:24] While Paul was making this defense, Festus called out loudly, “You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.”

[26:25] “I am not mad, your Excellency,” he replied. “On the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.[26:26] Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.[26:27] King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”

[26:28] But Agrippa said to Paul, “You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!”

[26:29] “Whether it is soon or late,” answered Paul, “I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself – except for these chains!”[26:30] Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,[26:31] and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. “There is nothing,” they said, “deserving death or imprisonment in this man’s conduct”;[26:32] and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, “The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.”

 [Acts 27] 


[27:1] As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.[27:2] We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.[27:3] The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.[27:4] Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;[27:5] and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.[27:6] There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.[27:7] For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavorable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,[27:8] and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called ‘Fair Havens,’ near which was the town of Lasea.

[27:9] This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.[27:10] “My friends,” he said, “I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.”

[27:11] The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul.[27:12] And, as the harbor was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favor of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbor, open to the north-east and south-east.[27:13] So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.[27:14] But shortly afterward a hurricane came down on us off the land – a north-easter, as it is called.[27:15] The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.[27:16] Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship’s boat,[27:17] and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.[27:18] So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,[27:19] and, on the following day, threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.[27:20] As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.

[27:21] It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said, “My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage.[27:22] Yet, even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you – only the ship.[27:23] For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said –[27:24] ‘Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers.’[27:25] Therefore, courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.[27:26] We will, however, have to be driven on some island.”

[27:27] It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land.[27:28] So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.[27:29] Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.[27:30] The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretense of running out anchors from the bows,[27:31] when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, “Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.”[27:32] So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.[27:33] In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.

“It is a fortnight today,” he said, “that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing.[27:34] So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”[27:35] With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;[27:36] and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.[27:37] There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.[27:38] After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.[27:39] When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.[27:40] Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.[27:41] They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.[27:42] The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.[27:43] But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;[27:44] and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.

 [Acts 28] 


[28:1] When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.[28:2] The island’s people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.[28:3] Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.[28:4] When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”[28:5] However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.[28:6] The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.

[28:7] In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.[28:8] It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.[28:9] After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.[28:10] They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.

[28:11] After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.[28:12] We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,[28:13] and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days.[28:14] There we found some of the Lord’s followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome.[28:15] The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.[28:16] On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him.

[28:17] Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said, “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.[28:18] The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.[28:19] But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor – not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.[28:20] This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.”

[28:21] “We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.[28:22] But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.”

[28:23] They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and from the prophets – speaking from morning until evening.[28:24] Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it.[28:25] So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only –

“True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors –

|  [28:26] Go to this nation and say:
|    You will hear with your ears without ever understanding,
|      and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving.
|    [28:27] For the mind of this nation has grown dense,
|      And their ears are dull of hearing,
|      Their eyes also have they closed;
|    Otherwise some day they might see with their eyes,
|    And with their ears they might hear,
|    And in their mind they might understand, and might turn –
|      And I might heal them.

[28:28] Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles; and they will listen.”[28:29] ^[ 28:29 Some later manuscripts add: After he said these things the Jews left, all the while engaging in a heated debate among themselves.]

[28:30] For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him,[28:31] proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unhindered.


Paul’s Letter to the
--------------------

Romans
======

 [Romans 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.[1:2] This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,[1:3] concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,[1:4] but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.[1:5] Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.[1:6] And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.

[1:7] To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:8] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.[1:9] God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,[1:10] asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.[1:11] For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –[1:12] or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.[1:13] I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.

##### Faith the Ground of Acceptance #####

[1:14] I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.[1:15] And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.

[1:16] For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.[1:17] For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’

[1:18] So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.[1:19] This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.[1:20] For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;[1:21] because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.[1:22] Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;[1:23] and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.

[1:24] Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;[1:25] for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.[1:26] That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;[1:27] while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.

[1:28] Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.[1:29] They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.[1:30] They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.[1:31] They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.[1:32] Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.

 [Romans 2] 

[2:1] Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.[2:2] And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.[2:3] You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?[2:4] Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?[2:5] Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;[2:6] for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.[2:7] To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;[2:8] while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,[2:9] will fall on every human being who persists in wrong-doing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.[2:10] But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,[2:11] since God shows no partiality.[2:12] All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.[2:13] It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.[2:14] When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;[2:15] for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense –[2:16] on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.

[2:17] But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,[2:18] and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.[2:19] Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,[2:20] and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.[2:21] Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?[2:22] Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?[2:23] Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?[2:24] For, as scripture says – ‘The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you’![2:25] Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.[2:26] If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?[2:27] Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.[2:28] For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;[2:29] and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.

 [Romans 3] 

[3:1] What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?[3:2] Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.[3:3] What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid![3:4] God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’

[3:5] But what if our wrong-doing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid![3:6] Otherwise how can God judge the world?

[3:7] But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?[3:8] Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!

[3:9] What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.[3:10] As scripture says –

|  ‘There is not even one who is righteous,
|    [3:11] not one who understands,
|    not one who is searching for God!
|  [3:12] They have all gone astray;
|    they have one and all become depraved;
|      there is no one who is doing good – no, not one!’
|  [3:13] ‘Their throats are like opened graves;
|    they deceive with their tongues.’
|  ‘The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,’
|    [3:14] ‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’
|  [3:15] ‘Swift are their feet to shed blood.
|  [3:16] Distress and trouble dog their steps,
|    [3:17] and the path of peace they do not know.’
|      [3:18] ‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’


[3:19] Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.[3:20] For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.

[3:21] But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –[3:22] the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.[3:23] For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,[3:24] but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.[3:25] For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;[3:26] as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.

[3:27] What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.

[3:28] For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.[3:29] Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?[3:30] Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.

[3:31] Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law.

 [Romans 4] 

[4:1] What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?[4:2] If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.[4:3] For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’[4:4] Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;[4:5] while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.

[4:6] In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –[4:7] ‘Blessed are those whose wrong-doings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn![4:8] Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’[4:9] Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’[4:10] Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?[4:11] Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;[4:12] as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.[4:13] For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.[4:14] If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing![4:15] Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.[4:16] That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;[4:17] as scripture says – ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.[4:18] With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words – ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’[4:19] Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.[4:20] He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.[4:21] On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.[4:22] And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’[4:23] Now these words – ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ – were not written with reference to Abraham only;[4:24] but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;[4:25] for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offenses, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.

 [Romans 5] 

[5:1] Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.[5:2] It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.[5:3] And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;[5:4] for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,[5:5] and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;[5:6] seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.[5:7] Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.[5:8] But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.[5:9] Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.[5:10] For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.[5:11] And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.

[5:12] Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.[5:13] Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.[5:14] Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.[5:15] But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.[5:16] There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.[5:17] For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.[5:18] Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.[5:19] For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.[5:20] Law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,[5:21] in order than, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

 [Romans 6] 

##### Difficulties arising from this Teaching #####

[6:1] What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?[6:2] Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it?[6:3] Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?[6:4] Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.[6:5] If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.[6:6] We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.[6:7] For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.[6:8] And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.[6:9] We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.[6:10] For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.[6:11] So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.[6:12] Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.[6:13] Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.[6:14] For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.

[6:15] What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid![6:16] Surely you know that, when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service sin which leads to death, or a service Duty which leads to righteousness.[6:17] God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.[6:18] Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.[6:19] I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.[6:20] While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.[6:21] But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.[6:22] But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.[6:23] The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.

 [Romans 7] 

[7:1] Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.[7:2] For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.[7:3] If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.[7:4] And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.[7:5] When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.[7:6] But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.

[7:7] What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.[7:8] But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.[7:9] There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the Commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died![7:10] The Commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death![7:11] sin took advantage of the Commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.[7:12] And so the Law is holy, and each Commandment is also holy, and just, and good.[7:13] Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the Commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.[7:14] We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.[7:15] I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.[7:16] But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.[7:17] This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.[7:18] I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.[7:19] I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.[7:20] But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.[7:21] This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself![7:22] At heart I delight in the Law of God;[7:23] but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.[7:24] Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?[7:25] Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.

 [Romans 8] 

[8:1] There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;[8:2] for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.[8:3] What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,[8:4] so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.[8:5] They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.[8:6] To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;[8:7] because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.[8:8] They who are earthly cannot please God.[8:9] You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;[8:10] but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.[8:11] And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.

[8:12] So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.[8:13] If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.[8:14] All who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.[8:15] For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a son which leads us to cry ‘Abba, Our Father.’[8:16] The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,[8:17] and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.

[8:18] I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.[8:19] All Nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.[8:20] For Nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –[8:21] yet not without the hope that some day Nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.[8:22] We know, indeed, that all Nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.[8:23] And not Nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.[8:24] By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?[8:25] But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.

[8:26] So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.[8:27] Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.[8:28] But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.[8:29] For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.[8:30] And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory.

[8:31] What are we to say, then, in the light of all this?

|  If God is on our side, who can there be against us?
|  [8:32] God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?
|  [8:33] Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God!
|  [8:34] Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf!
|  [8:35] Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?

[8:36] Scripture says – ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’[8:37] Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us![8:38] For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,[8:39] nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!

 [Romans 9] 

##### Gentiles and Jews #####

[9:1] I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,[9:2] bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.[9:3] I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.[9:4] For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as sons, the visible presence, the Covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the Promises.[9:5] They are descended from the Patriarchs; and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.

[9:6] Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;[9:7] nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’[9:8] This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the Promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.[9:9] For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’[9:10] Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.[9:11] For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,[9:12] that the elder would be a servant to the younger.[9:13] The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’

[9:14] What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid![9:15] For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’[9:16] So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.[9:17] In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’[9:18] So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.[9:19] Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?’[9:20] I might rather ask ‘Who are you who are arguing with God?’ Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it ‘Why did you make me like this?’[9:21] Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?[9:22] And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,[9:23] so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,[9:24] and whom he called – even us – Not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also![9:25] This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – ‘Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.[9:26] And in the place where it was said to them – “You are not my people”, they will be called sons of the living God.’[9:27] And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – ‘Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape![9:28] For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.’[9:29] It is as Isaiah foretold – ‘Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.’

[9:30] What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;[9:31] while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.[9:32] And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.[9:33] As scripture says – ‘See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.’

 [Romans 10] 

[10:1] My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.[10:2] I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,[10:3] for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.[10:4] For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.[10:5] For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.[10:6] But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ (which means to bring Christ down)[10:7] ‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).[10:8] No, but what does it say? ‘The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart’ (which means ‘The Message of faith’ which we proclaim).[10:9] For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.[10:10] For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of faith and so find salvation.[10:11] As the passage of scripture says – ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’[10:12] For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.[10:13] For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.[10:14] But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?[10:15] And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’

[10:16] Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’[10:17] And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.[10:18] But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for – ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’[10:19] But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand?’ First there is Moses, who says – ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’[10:20] And Isaiah says boldly – ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.’[10:21] But of the people of Israel he says – ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’

 [Romans 11] 

[11:1] I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.[11:2] God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?[11:3] ‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’[11:4] But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’[11:5] And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.[11:6] But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.[11:7] What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.[11:8] The rest grew callous; as scripture says – ‘God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.’[11:9] David, too, says – ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;[11:10] may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’[11:11] I ask then – ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.[11:12] And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!

[11:13] But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.[11:14] Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.[11:15] For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?[11:16] If the first handful of dough in holy, so is the whole mass; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.[11:17] Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.[11:18] Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.[11:19] But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.[11:20] True; it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.[11:21] For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.[11:22] See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.[11:23] And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.[11:24] If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree.

[11:25] My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognize the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.[11:26] And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.[11:27] And they will see the fulfillment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.’[11:28] From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the Patriarchs.[11:29] For God never regrets his gifts or his call.[11:30] Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;[11:31] so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.[11:32] For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.[11:33] Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –[11:34] Who has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?[11:35] Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?[11:36] For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.

 [Romans 12] 

##### Advice on Daily Life #####

[12:1] I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.[12:2] Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.

[12:3] In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.[12:4] For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,[12:5] so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.[12:6] Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;[12:7] if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,[12:8] the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.[12:9] Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.[12:10] In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;[12:11] never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;[12:12] rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;[12:13] relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.[12:14] Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.[12:15] Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.[12:16] Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.[12:17] Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.[12:18] If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.[12:19] Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’[12:20] Rather – ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’[12:21] Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.

 [Romans 13] 

[13:1] Let everyone obey the supreme Authorities. For no Authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing Authorities have been appointed by God.[13:2] Therefore he who sets himself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.[13:3] A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.[13:4] For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.[13:5] You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.[13:6] This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.[13:7] In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due.

[13:8] Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the Law.[13:9] The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, You must not kill, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’[13:10] Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.[13:11] This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.

[13:12] The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us have done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.[13:13] Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.[13:14] No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.

 [Romans 14] 

[14:1] As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.[14:2] One person’s faith permits of their eating food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.[14:3] The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.[14:4] Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.[14:5] Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.[14:6] The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.[14:7] There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;[14:8] for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.[14:9] The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.[14:10] I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.[14:11] For scripture says – ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.”’[14:12] So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.

[14:13] Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.[14:14] Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.[14:15] If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died![14:16] Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.[14:17] For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.[14:18] The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.[14:19] Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.[14:20] Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.[14:21] The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.[14:22] As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right![14:23] The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.

 [Romans 15] 

[15:1] We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.[15:2] Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.[15:3] Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’[15:4] Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.[15:5] And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,[15:6] so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.[15:7] Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.[15:8] For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,[15:9] and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’[15:10] And again it says – ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’[15:11] And yet again – ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’[15:12] Again, Isaiah says – ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’[15:13] May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

[15:14] I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.[15:15] But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –[15:16] because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.[15:17] It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.[15:18] For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –[15:19] by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;[15:20] yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.[15:21] But as scripture says – ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’

##### Conclusion #####

[15:22] That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.[15:23] But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.[15:24] For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.[15:25] Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.[15:26] For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.[15:27] Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.[15:28] When I have settled this matter, and have secured to the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.[15:29] And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.

[15:30] I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.[15:31] Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;[15:32] so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.[15:33] May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.

 [Romans 16] 

[16:1] I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is an assistant of the church at Cenchreae;[16:2] and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others.

[16:3] Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,[16:4] who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.[16:5] Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;[16:6] to Mary, who worked hard for you;[16:7] to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;[16:8] to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus;[16:9] to Urban, our fellow worker in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys;[16:10] to that proved Christian Apelles; to the household of Aristobulus;[16:11] to my countryman Herodion; to the Christians in the household of Narcissus;[16:12] to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master;[16:13] to that eminent Christian, Rufus, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me also;[16:14] to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and our friends with them;[16:15] also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all Christ’s people who are with them.[16:16] Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.

[16:17] I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them.[16:18] For such persons are not serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and, by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.[16:19] Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good, and innocent of all that is bad.[16:20] And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet.

May the blessing of Jesus, our Lord, be with you.

[16:21] Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, send theirs.

[16:22] I Tertius, who am writing this letter, send you my Christian greeting.

[16:23] My host Gaius, who extends his hospitality to the whole church, sends you his greeting; and Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus, our dear friend, add theirs.[16:24] ^[ 16:24 Some later manuscripts add: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]

[16:25] Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past ages was kept secret but now has been revealed[16:26] and, in obedience to the command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith –[16:27] to him, I say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory for ever and ever. Amen.


Paul’s First Letter to the
--------------------------

Corinthians
===========

 [1 Corinthians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,[1:2] from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.

[1:3] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:4] I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.[1:5] For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;[1:6] and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.[1:7] There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.[1:8] And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.[1:9] God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

##### The State of the Church at Corinth #####

[1:10] But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.[1:11] For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.[1:12] I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’[1:13] You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the faith of Paul?[1:14] I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,[1:15] so that no one can say that you were baptized into my faith.[1:16] I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.[1:17] My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.

[1:18] The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.[1:19] For scripture says –

|  ‘I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.’

[1:20] Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?[1:21] For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ![1:22] While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,[1:23] we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,[1:24] but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God![1:25] For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.

[1:26] Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;[1:27] but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,[1:28] and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,[1:29] so that in his presence no one should boast.[1:30] But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,[1:31] so that – in the words of scripture –

|  ‘Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!’

 [1 Corinthians 2] 

[2:1] For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;[2:2] for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ – and him crucified![2:3] Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.[2:4] My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,[2:5] so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.

[2:6] Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.[2:7] No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.[2:8] This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.[2:9] It is what scripture speaks of as –

|  ‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,
|  what never entered people’s minds –
|    even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’

[2:10] Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.[2:11] For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.[2:12] And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.[2:13] And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.[2:14] The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.[2:15] But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.[2:16] For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.

 [1 Corinthians 3] 

[3:1] But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.[3:2] I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.

No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.[3:3] While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?[3:4] When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?[3:5] What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.[3:6] I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.[3:7] Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.[3:8] In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.[3:9] For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.

[3:10] In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;[3:11] for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.[3:12] Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,[3:13] the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.[3:14] If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.[3:15] If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.

[3:16] Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?[3:17] If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.

[3:18] Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.[3:19] For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of –

|  ‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’

[3:20] And it says again –

|  ‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’

[3:21] Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –[3:22] Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours![3:23] But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.

 [1 Corinthians 4] 

[4:1] Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.[4:2] Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.[4:3] But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;[4:4] for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.[4:5] Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.

[4:6] All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.[4:7] For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?[4:8] Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you![4:9] For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people![4:10] We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.[4:11] To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;[4:12] we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,[4:13] we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.

[4:14] It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.[4:15] Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.[4:16] Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.[4:17] This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.

[4:18] Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.[4:19] But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;[4:20] for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.[4:21] What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?

 [1 Corinthians 5] 

[5:1] There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife![5:2] Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?[5:3] For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.[5:4] I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –[5:5] to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.[5:6] Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?[5:7] Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;[5:8] therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

[5:9] I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –[5:10] not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.[5:11] But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.[5:12] What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,[5:13] while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.

 [1 Corinthians 6] 


[6:1] Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?[6:2] Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?[6:3] Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?[6:4] Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.[6:5] Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?[6:6] Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?[6:7] To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?[6:8] Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers![6:9] Don’t you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,[6:10] or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.[6:11] Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!

[6:12] Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.[6:13] Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;[6:14] and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.[6:15] Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid![6:16] Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);[6:17] while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?[6:18] Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.[6:19] Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?[6:20] Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.

 [1 Corinthians 7] 

##### Answers to Questions Asked by the Church at Corinth #####

[7:1] With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.[7:2] But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.[7:3] A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.[7:4] It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.[7:5] Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.[7:6] I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.[7:7] I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.

[7:8] My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.[7:9] But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.[7:10] To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband[7:11] (If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.[7:12] To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;[7:13] and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.[7:14] For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.[7:15] However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.[7:16] How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?

[7:17] In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.[7:18] Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.[7:19] Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.[7:20] Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.[7:21] Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.[7:22] For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.[7:23] You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.[7:24] Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.

[7:25] With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.[7:26] I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.[7:27] Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.[7:28] Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.[7:29] What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,[7:30] those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,[7:31] and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.[7:32] I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;[7:33] while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;[7:34] and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.[7:35] I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter around your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.

[7:36] If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.[7:37] On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.[7:38] In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.

[7:39] A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.[7:40] Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

 [1 Corinthians 8] 


[8:1] With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.[8:2] If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.[8:3] On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.[8:4] With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.[8:5] Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ –[8:6] Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).[8:7] Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.[8:8] What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.[8:9] But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.[8:10] For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?[8:11] And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died![8:12] In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.[8:13] Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.

 [1 Corinthians 9] 


[9:1] Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?[9:2] If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.[9:3] The defense that I make to my critics is this:[9:4] Haven’t we a right to food and drink?[9:5] Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?[9:6] Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?[9:7] Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?[9:8] Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?[9:9] For in the Law of Moses it is said –

|  ‘You should not muzzle a bullock while it is treading out the grain.’

Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?[9:10] Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the plowman ought not to plow, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.[9:11] Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?[9:12] If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.[9:13] Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?[9:14] So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.[9:15] I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one![9:16] If I tell the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not tell it![9:17] If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.[9:18] What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.

[9:19] Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.[9:20] To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.[9:21] To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.[9:22] To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.[9:23] And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.

[9:24] Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.[9:25] Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.[9:26] I, therefore, run with no uncertain aim. I box – not like a man hitting the air.[9:27] No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.

 [1 Corinthians 10] 


[10:1] I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;[10:2] that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;[10:3] and that they all ate the same supernatural food,[10:4] and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.[10:5] Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.[10:6] Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.[10:7] Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says –

|  ‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.’

[10:8] Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.[10:9] Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.[10:10] And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.[10:11] These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.

[10:12] Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.[10:13] No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.

[10:14] Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.[10:15] I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.[10:16] In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?[10:17] The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.[10:18] Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?[10:19] What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?[10:20] No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.[10:21] You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.[10:22] Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?

[10:23] Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.[10:24] A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.

[10:25] Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;[10:26] for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.[10:27] If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.[10:28] But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.[10:29] I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?[10:30] If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?

[10:31] Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.[10:32] Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;[10:33] for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.

 [1 Corinthians 11] 

[11:1] Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.

[11:2] I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.[11:3] But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.[11:4] Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonors him who is his head;[11:5] while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonors him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.[11:6] Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.[11:7] A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.[11:8] For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.[11:9] Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.[11:10] And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.[11:11] Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;[11:12] for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.[11:13] Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?[11:14] Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,[11:15] a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.[11:16] If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.

[11:17] In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.[11:18] To begin with, I hear you and, to some extent, I believe it.[11:19] Indeed, there must be actual parties among you, for so only will the people of real worth become known.[11:20] When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;[11:21] for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink![11:22] Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.[11:23] For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,[11:24] and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said  “This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.” [11:25] And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying  “This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.” [11:26] For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.[11:27] Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offense against the Lord’s body and blood.[11:28] Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.[11:29] For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.[11:30] That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.[11:31] But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.[11:32] Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.[11:33] Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.[11:34] If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.

 [1 Corinthians 12] 


[12:1] In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.[12:2] You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.[12:3] Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.[12:4] Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;[12:5] ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;[12:6] results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.[12:7] To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.[12:8] To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;[12:9] to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;[12:10] to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’[12:11] All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.

[12:12] For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;[12:13] for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.[12:14] The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.[12:15] If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.[12:16] Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.[12:17] If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?[12:18] But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.[12:19] If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?[12:20] But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.[12:21] The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’[12:22] No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;[12:23] and those parts which we deem less honorable we surround with special honor; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.[12:24] Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honor to the part that lacks it –[12:25] As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.[12:26] If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honor done it, all the others share its joy.[12:27] Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.[12:28] In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’[12:29] Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?[12:30] Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them?[12:31] Strive for the greater gifts.

Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best.

 [1 Corinthians 13] 

[13:1] Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal![13:2] Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing![13:3] Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing![13:4] Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;[13:5] love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;[13:6] love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;[13:7] love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.[13:8] Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.[13:9] For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,[13:10] but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.[13:11] When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.[13:12] As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.[13:13] Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.

 [1 Corinthians 14] 

[14:1] Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.[14:2] The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.[14:3] But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.[14:4] Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.[14:5] Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.[14:6] This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?[14:7] Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?[14:8] If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?[14:9] And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds![14:10] There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.[14:11] If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.[14:12] And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.[14:13] Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ should pray for ability to interpret them.[14:14] If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.[14:15] What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.[14:16] If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying![14:17] Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.[14:18] Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.[14:19] But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’

[14:20] My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.[14:21] It is said in the Law –

|  ‘In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.’

[14:22] Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.[14:23] So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?[14:24] While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;[14:25] the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’

[14:26] What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.[14:27] If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.[14:28] If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.[14:29] Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.[14:30] But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.[14:31] For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.[14:32] (The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;[14:33] for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.

[14:34] At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.[14:35] If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.[14:36] What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?

[14:37] If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.[14:38] Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.[14:39] Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’[14:40] Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.

 [1 Corinthians 15] 

##### The Apostle’s Teaching as to the Resurrection of the Dead #####

[15:1] Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,[15:2] and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.[15:3] For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),[15:4] that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),[15:5] and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.[15:6] After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.[15:7] After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.[15:8] Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.[15:9] For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.[15:10] But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.[15:11] Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.

[15:12] Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?[15:13] But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;[15:14] and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also![15:15] Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise![15:16] For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,[15:17] and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still![15:18] Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished![15:19] If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.

[15:20] But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.[15:21] For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.[15:22] For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.[15:23] But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.[15:24] Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.[15:25] For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’[15:26] The last enemy to be overthrown is death;[15:27] for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)[15:28] And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all![15:29] Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?[15:30] Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?[15:31] Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.[15:32] If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die![15:33] Do not be deceived.

|  ‘Good character is marred by evil company.’

[15:34] Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.

[15:35] Someone, however, may ask ‘How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?’[15:36] You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies![15:37] And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.[15:38] God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.[15:39] All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.[15:40] There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.[15:41] There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.[15:42] It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;[15:43] sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.[15:44] As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.[15:45] That is what is meant by the words – ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.[15:46] That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterward comes the spiritual;[15:47] the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.[15:48] Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.[15:49] And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.[15:50] This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.[15:51] Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,[15:52] at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.[15:53] For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.[15:54] And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true –

|  [15:55] ‘death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?’

[15:56] It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.[15:57] But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.[15:58] Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.

 [1 Corinthians 16] 

##### Conclusion #####

[16:1] With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.[16:2] On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.[16:3] On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;[16:4] and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.

[16:5] I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –[16:6] And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.[16:7] I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.[16:8] I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;[16:9] for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.

[16:10] If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.[16:11] No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.

[16:12] As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.

[16:13] Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.[16:14] Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.

[16:15] I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.[16:16] I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker.[16:17] I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;[16:18] they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these.

[16:19] The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.[16:20] All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.

[16:21] I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.[16:22] Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.[16:23] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.[16:24] My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.


Paul’s Second Letter to the
---------------------------

Corinthians
===========

 [2 Corinthians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.[1:2] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:3] Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,[1:4] who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.[1:5] It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.[1:6] If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;[1:7] and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.[1:8] We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.[1:9] Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.[1:10] And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.[1:11] And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.

##### The Apostle’s Relations with his Converts #####

[1:12] Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.[1:13] We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –[1:14] And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.

[1:15] With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –[1:16] To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.[1:17] As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?[1:18] As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’![1:19] The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’[1:20] For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.[1:21] God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,[1:22] also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.

[1:23] But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.[1:24] I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.

 [2 Corinthians 2] 

[2:1] For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.[2:2] If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?[2:3] So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.[2:4] I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.

[2:5] Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.[2:6] The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;[2:7] so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.[2:8] So I entreat you to assure him of your love.[2:9] I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.[2:10] Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,[2:11] so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

[2:12] When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,[2:13] I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.[2:14] All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.[2:15] For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.[2:16] To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?[2:17] Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.

 [2 Corinthians 3] 


[3:1] Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?[3:2] You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.[3:3] All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

##### The Ministry of the Apostles #####

[3:4] This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.[3:5] I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;[3:6] our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.

[3:7] If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,[3:8] will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?[3:9] For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness![3:10] Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.[3:11] And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!

[3:12] With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;[3:13] unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.[3:14] But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.[3:15] But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.[3:16] Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.[3:17] And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.[3:18] And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.

 [2 Corinthians 4] 

[4:1] Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.[4:2] No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.[4:3] And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –[4:4] people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.[4:5] (For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)[4:6] Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.

[4:7] This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.[4:8] Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;[4:9] though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed![4:10] We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.[4:11] Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.[4:12] And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.[4:13] But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.[4:14] For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.[4:15] For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.

[4:16] Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.[4:17] The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory;[4:18] we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.

 [2 Corinthians 5] 

[5:1] For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.[5:2] Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,[5:3] sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate.[5:4] For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.[5:5] And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.

[5:6] Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.[5:7] For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.[5:8] And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.[5:9] Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.[5:10] For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.

[5:11] Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.[5:12] We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.[5:13] For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours![5:14] It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;[5:15] and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.

[5:16] For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.[5:17] Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun![5:18] But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the Ministry of Reconciliation –[5:19] To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.

[5:20] It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.[5:21] For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.

 [2 Corinthians 6] 

[6:1] Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.[6:2] For he says –

|  ‘At the time for acceptance I listened to you,
|  And on the day of deliverance I helped you.’

Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance![6:3] Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.[6:4] No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,[6:5] in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;[6:6] by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;[6:7] by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;[6:8] amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;[6:9] as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;[6:10] as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!

##### The Apostle and his Converts #####

[6:11] We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;[6:12] there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.[6:13] Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us?

[6:14] Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?[6:15] What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?[6:16] What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said –

|  ‘I will live among them, and walk among them;
|    And I will be their God, and they will be my people.
|  [6:17] Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord,
|  “And touch nothing impure;
|    And I will welcome you;
|  [6:18] and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,”
|    says the Lord, the Ruler of all.’

 [2 Corinthians 7] 

[7:1] With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.

[7:2] Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.[7:3] I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.[7:4] I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.

[7:5] Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.[7:6] But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.[7:7] And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.[7:8] For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –[7:9] I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.[7:10] For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.[7:11] For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.[7:12] So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.

[7:13] In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.[7:14] Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.[7:15] And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.[7:16] I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.

 [2 Corinthians 8] 

##### The Palestine Famine Fund #####

[8:1] We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –[8:2] How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.[8:3] I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,[8:4] and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.[8:5] And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.[8:6] And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.[8:7] And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.

[8:8] I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.[8:9] For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.[8:10] I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.[8:11] And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.[8:12] For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.[8:13] For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.[8:14] On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.[8:15] As scripture says –

|  ‘Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did not lack!’

[8:16] I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;[8:17] for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.[8:18] We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;[8:19] and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honor of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.[8:20] What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;[8:21] for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.[8:22] We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.[8:23] If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.[8:24] Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.

 [2 Corinthians 9] 

[9:1] With reference, indeed, to the Fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.[9:2] I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.[9:3] So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.[9:4] Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.[9:5] Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.

[9:6] Remember the saying – ‘Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.’[9:7] Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.[9:8] God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.[9:9] (As scripture says –

|  ‘He scattered broadcast, he gave to the poor; His righteousness continues for ever.’

[9:10] And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).[9:11] Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.[9:12] For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.[9:13] Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.[9:14] And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.[9:15] All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!

 [2 Corinthians 10] 

##### The Apostle’s Claims and Authority #####

[10:1] Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” –[10:2] I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.[10:3] For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.[10:4] The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.[10:5] We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,[10:6] and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.[10:7] You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.[10:8] Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.[10:9] I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.[10:10] For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”[10:11] Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.[10:12] We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.[10:13] We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.[10:14] For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ![10:15] Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –[10:16] So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.[10:17] Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.[10:18] For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.

 [2 Corinthians 11] 


[11:1] I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.[11:2] I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I engaged you to one husband so that I might present you to the Christ a pure bride.[11:3] Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.[11:4] For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant![11:5] I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles![11:6] Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.

[11:7] Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.[11:8] I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you![11:9] And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.[11:10] As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.[11:11] Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!

[11:12] What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.[11:13] Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ![11:14] And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.[11:15] It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.

[11:16] I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.[11:17] When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.[11:18] As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.[11:19] For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough![11:20] You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face![11:21] I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either![11:22] Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I![11:23] Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.[11:24] Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.[11:25] Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.[11:26] My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.[11:27] I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.[11:28] And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.[11:29] Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?[11:30] If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness![11:31] The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.[11:32] When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,[11:33] but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.

 [2 Corinthians 12] 

[12:1] I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.[12:2] I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.[12:3] And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –[12:4] Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.[12:5] About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.[12:6] Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.[12:7] It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.[12:8] About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.[12:9] But his reply has been –  ‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’ 

Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.[12:10] That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!

##### Conclusion #####

[12:11] I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.[12:12] The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.[12:13] In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!

[12:14] Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.[12:15] For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?[12:16] You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”![12:17] Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?[12:18] I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?

[12:19] Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;[12:20] for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.[12:21] I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.

 [2 Corinthians 13] 

[13:1] For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.[13:2] I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.[13:3] And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.[13:4] For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.[13:5] Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognize this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test![13:6] But I hope that you will recognize that we can stand the test.[13:7] We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.[13:8] We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.[13:9] We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.[13:10] This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.

[13:11] And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.[13:12] Greet one another with a sacred kiss.[13:13] All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.

[13:14] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.


Paul’s Letter to the

Galatians
=========

 [Galatians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;[1:2] and from all the followers of the Lord here.[1:3] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,[1:4] gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of God and Father,[1:5] to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.

[1:6] I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’[1:7] which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.[1:8] Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed![1:9] We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!

[1:10] Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.

##### The Independence of the Apostle’s Gospel #####

[1:11] I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.[1:12] I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.

[1:13] You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,[1:14] and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.[1:15] But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,[1:16] saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,[1:17] or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.[1:18] Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.[1:19] I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.[1:20] (As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).[1:21] Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.[1:22] But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;[1:23] all that they had heard was – ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’[1:24] And they praised God for my sake.

 [Galatians 2] 

[2:1] Fourteen years afterward I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.[2:2] It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.[2:3] Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.[2:4] But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –[2:5] Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always![2:6] Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.[2:7] On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.[2:8] For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.[2:9] Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.[2:10] Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.[2:11] But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.[2:12] Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.[2:13] The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.[2:14] But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”

##### The Law and the Gospel #####

[2:15] We, though we are Jews by birth and not outcasts of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.[2:16] So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.[2:17] If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be outcasts, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid![2:18] For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.[2:19] I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.[2:20] I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.[2:21] I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die!

 [Galatians 3] 


[3:1] Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?[3:2] Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?[3:3] Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?[3:4] Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose![3:5] He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?[3:6] It is just as it was with Abraham –

|  he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.

[3:7] You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.[3:8] And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words –

|  ‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’

[3:9] And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.[3:10] All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says –

|  ‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the Law, and do it.’

[3:11] Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read –

|  ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’

[3:12] But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are –

|  ‘Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.’

[3:13] Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says –

|  ‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’

[3:14] And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.

[3:15] To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.[3:16] Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.[3:17] My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.[3:18] If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.

[3:19] What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.[3:20] Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.[3:21] Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.[3:22] But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.

[3:23] Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.[3:24] Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.[3:25] But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.

[3:26] For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.[3:27] For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.[3:28] All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.[3:29] And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.

 [Galatians 4] 

[4:1] My point is this – As long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.[4:2] He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.[4:3] And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;[4:4] but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –[4:5] To ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.

[4:6] And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – ‘Abba, our Father.’[4:7] You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment.

[4:8] Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.[4:9] But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?[4:10] You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years![4:11] You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted.

[4:12] I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.[4:13] You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.[4:14] And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself![4:15] What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me![4:16] Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?[4:17] Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.[4:18] It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –[4:19] you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.[4:20] But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.

[4:21] Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?[4:22] Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.[4:23] But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.[4:24] This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar[4:25] (The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.[4:26] But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.[4:27] For scripture says –

|  ‘Rejoice, you barren one, who does never bear,
|  Break into shouts, you who are never in labor,
|    For many are the children of her who is desolate –
|      aye, more than of her who has a husband.’

[4:28] As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.[4:29] Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.[4:30] But what does the passage of scripture say?

|  ‘Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave’s son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.’

[4:31] And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free.

 [Galatians 5] 

##### The Gospel in the Daily Life #####

[5:1] It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.

[5:2] Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.[5:3] I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.[5:4] You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.[5:5] For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.[5:6] If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.[5:7] You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?[5:8] The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.[5:9] A little leaven leavens all the dough.[5:10] I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.[5:11] If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle![5:12] I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.

[5:13] Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence, but serve one another in a loving spirit.[5:14] Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept –

|  ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’

[5:15] But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.

[5:16] This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.[5:17] For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.[5:18] But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.[5:19] The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,[5:20] idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,[5:21] feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.[5:22] But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.[5:23] Against such things there is no law![5:24] And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.

[5:25] Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.[5:26] Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.

 [Galatians 6] 

[6:1] My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.[6:2] Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.[6:3] If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.[6:4] Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;[6:5] for everyone must bear their own load.[6:6] The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.

[6:7] Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.[6:8] For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.[6:9] Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.[6:10] Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the Household of the faith.

##### Conclusion in the Apostle’s own handwriting #####

[6:11] See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.[6:12] Those who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances are the people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised; and they do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ.[6:13] Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.[6:14] But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.[6:15] For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.[6:16] May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God.

[6:17] For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.

[6:18] May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.


Paul’s Letter to the
--------------------

Ephesians
=========

 [Ephesians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.[1:2] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:3] Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.[1:4] For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.[1:5] From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,[1:6] and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;[1:7] for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.[1:8] All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,[1:9] when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,[1:10] in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.[1:11] In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;[1:12] that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.[1:13] And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.[1:14] And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory.

##### The power of God displayed in Christ, the Head of the Church #####

[1:15] And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,[1:16] have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.[1:17] My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;[1:18] that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,[1:19] and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.[1:20] The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,[1:21] and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.[1:22] And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;[1:23] for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.

 [Ephesians 2] 

[2:1] You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.[2:2] For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.[2:3] And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.[2:4] Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,[2:5] even though we were dead because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)[2:6] And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,[2:7] in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.[2:8] For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.[2:9] It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.[2:10] For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.

[2:11] Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘the Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘the Circumcised’ – circumcised only by human hands![2:12] Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the Covenants founded on God’s Promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.[2:13] But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.[2:14] He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,[2:15] and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.[2:16] And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.[2:17] He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;[2:18] for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.[2:19] It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s Household.[2:20] You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the corner-stone.[2:21] United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.[2:22] And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.

 [Ephesians 3] 

##### The Apostle’s Divine Commission to the Gentiles #####

[3:1] For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –[3:2] For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,[3:3] and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.[3:4] And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.[3:5] In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –[3:6] That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.[3:7] Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –[3:8] Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,[3:9] and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;[3:10] so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,[3:11] in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.[3:12] And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.[3:13] Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.[3:14] For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –[3:15] from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name –[3:16] And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,[3:17] so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,[3:18] have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,[3:19] and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself.

[3:20] To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –[3:21] To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.

 [Ephesians 4] 

##### The Gospel and Daily Life #####

[4:1] I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;[4:2] always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,[4:3] and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.[4:4] There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.[4:5] There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.[4:6] There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.[4:7] Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.[4:8] That is why it is said –

|  ‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’

[4:9] Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.[4:10] He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.[4:11] And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,[4:12] to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.[4:13] And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.[4:14] Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;[4:15] but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.[4:16] For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.

[4:17] This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,[4:18] with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.[4:19] Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.[4:20] But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,[4:21] and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.[4:22] For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;[4:23] that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;[4:24] and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.

[4:25] Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.[4:26] Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;[4:27] and give no opportunity to the devil.[4:28] Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.[4:29] Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.[4:30] And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.[4:31] Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.[4:32] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.

 [Ephesians 5] 

[5:1] Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,[5:2] and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.

[5:3] As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,[5:4] nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.[5:5] For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.

[5:6] Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.[5:7] Therefore have nothing to do with such people.[5:8] For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –[5:9] for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –[5:10] always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.[5:11] Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.[5:12] It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.[5:13] All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.[5:14] For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said –

|  ‘Sleeper, awake!
|  Arise from the dead,
|    And the Christ will give you light!’

[5:15] Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,[5:16] making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.[5:17] Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.[5:18] Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.[5:19] Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.[5:20] Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[5:21] Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ.

[5:22] Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.[5:23] For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Savior of his body.[5:24] But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.[5:25] Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,[5:26] to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;[5:27] so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.[5:28] That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;[5:29] for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;[5:30] for we are members of his body.

|  [5:31] For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one.

[5:32] In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.[5:33] However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.

 [Ephesians 6] 

[6:1] Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.[6:2] ‘Honor your father and mother’ – this is the first Commandment with a promise –[6:3] ‘so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.’[6:4] And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.

[6:5] Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;[6:6] not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.[6:7] Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;[6:8] for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.[6:9] And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.

[6:10] For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.[6:11] Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.[6:12] For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.[6:13] Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.[6:14] Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breast-plate,[6:15] and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.[6:16] At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.[6:17] And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.[6:18] Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –[6:19] and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,[6:20] on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.

##### Conclusion #####

[6:21] To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the Master’s cause, will tell you everything.[6:22] I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.

[6:23] May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower peace, and love linked with faith.[6:24] May God’s blessing be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.


Paul’s Letter to the
--------------------

Philippians
===========

 [Philippians 1] 

[1:1] To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.[1:2] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.[1:3] Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God,[1:4] always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –[1:5] Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.[1:6] For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.[1:7] And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.[1:8] God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.[1:9] And what I pray for is this – that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,[1:10] until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,[1:11] bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

[1:12] Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.[1:13] It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.[1:14] And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.[1:15] It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.[1:16] The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.[1:17] The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.[1:18] But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.[1:19] Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.[1:20] And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,[1:21] for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.[1:22] But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way![1:23] My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.[1:24] But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.[1:25] Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;[1:26] so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.[1:27] Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,[1:28] without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.[1:29] For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.[1:30] You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.

 [Philippians 2] 

[2:1] If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,[2:2] I entreat you to make my happiness complete – Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.[2:3] Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,[2:4] considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.[2:5] Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.[2:6] Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,[2:7] but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;[2:8] he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross![2:9] And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,[2:10] so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,[2:11] and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.[2:12] Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.[2:13] Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.[2:14] In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,[2:15] so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,[2:16] offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.[2:17] And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;[2:18] and you must also rejoice and share my joy.[2:19] I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.[2:20] For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.[2:21] They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.[2:22] But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.[2:23] It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me.[2:24] And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.[2:25] Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.[2:26] For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.[2:27] And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.[2:28] I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.[2:29] Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.[2:30] For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.

 [Philippians 3] 

[3:1] In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.[3:2] Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves![3:3] For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;[3:4] though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I![3:5] I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;[3:6] as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.[3:7] But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.[3:8] More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as refuse, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;[3:9] any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.[3:10] Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,[3:11] in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.[3:12] Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.[3:13] For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,[3:14] I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.[3:15] Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.[3:16] Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.

[3:17] My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.[3:18] For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.[3:19] The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.[3:20] But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.[3:21] By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body.

 [Philippians 4] 

[4:1] So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.[4:2] I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;[4:3] yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.[4:4] All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.[4:5] Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.[4:6] Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.[4:7] Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.

[4:8] In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honor have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.[4:9] All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.[4:10] It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.[4:11] Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.[4:12] I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.[4:13] I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong![4:14] Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.[4:15] And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.[4:16] Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.[4:17] It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.[4:18] My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.[4:19] And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.[4:20] To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.[4:21] Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.[4:22] All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.

[4:23] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.


Paul’s Letter to the
--------------------

Colossians
==========

 [Colossians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, also a follower of the Lord.[1:2] To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace.

[1:3] Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,[1:4] now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,[1:5] because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,[1:6] bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.[1:7] It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,[1:8] and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.

[1:9] And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.[1:10] Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;[1:11] you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;[1:12] and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light.

##### The Person and Work of the Christ #####

[1:13] For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his love,[1:14] and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins.

[1:15] For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – first-born and head of all creation;[1:16] for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.[1:17] All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;[1:18] and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The first-born from the dead, he is to the church the Source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.[1:19] For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,[1:20] and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.[1:21] And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –[1:22] But now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,[1:23] if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.

[1:24] Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;[1:25] of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –[1:26] That truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,[1:27] to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – ‘Christ among you! Your hope of glory!’[1:28] This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.[1:29] It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me.

 [Colossians 2] 

[2:1] I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;[2:2] in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,[2:3] even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.[2:4] I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.[2:5] It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.

[2:6] Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –[2:7] rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.[2:8] Take care there is not someone who will carry you away by his ‘philosophy’ – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.[2:9] For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;[2:10] and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.[2:11] By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.[2:12] For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.[2:13] And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins![2:14] He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross![2:15] He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!

[2:16] Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.[2:17] These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.[2:18] Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called ‘humility’ and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.[2:19] They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth.

[2:20] Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,[2:21] to such ordinances as ‘Do not handle, or taste, or touch’?[2:22] For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.[2:23] Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.

 [Colossians 3] 

[3:1] Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.[3:2] Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.[3:3] For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.[3:4] When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

##### The Gospel in the Daily Life #####

[3:5] Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.[3:6] These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,[3:7] and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.[3:8] You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.[3:9] Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,[3:10] and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.[3:11] In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all!

[3:12] Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;[3:13] bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.[3:14] Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.[3:15] Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.[3:16] Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.[3:17] And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.

[3:18] Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.[3:19] Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.[3:20] Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.[3:21] Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.[3:22] Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.[3:23] Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,[3:24] since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.[3:25] Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.

 [Colossians 4] 

[4:1] Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven.

[4:2] Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;[4:3] and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains![4:4] Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.[4:5] Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.[4:6] Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.

##### Conclusion #####

[4:7] Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.[4:8] I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.[4:9] With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.

[4:10] My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)[4:11] Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.[4:12] Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.[4:13] I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.[4:14] Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.[4:15] Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.[4:16] And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.[4:17] Give this message to Archippus – ‘Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master’s cause.’

[4:18] I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God’s blessing be with you.


Paul’s First Letter to the
--------------------------

Thessalonians
=============

 [1 Thessalonians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.

##### The Apostle and his Converts #####

[1:2] We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;[1:3] recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.[1:4] Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,[1:5] because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.[1:6] And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,[1:7] and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.[1:8] For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.[1:9] Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,[1:10] and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.

 [1 Thessalonians 2] 

[2:1] Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.[2:2] For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.[2:3] Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.[2:4] But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.[2:5] Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.[2:6] Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.[2:7] But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.[2:8] In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us.[2:9] You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.[2:10] You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.[2:11] Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;[2:12] so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.

[2:13] This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.[2:14] For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –[2:15] who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,[2:16] for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!

[2:17] As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.[2:18] That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.[2:19] For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?[2:20] You are our pride and our delight!

 [1 Thessalonians 3] 

[3:1] And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,[3:2] and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,[3:3] so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.[3:4] For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.[3:5] Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.[3:6] But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –[3:7] on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.[3:8] For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.[3:9] How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?[3:10] Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.

[3:11] May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.[3:12] And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;[3:13] and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.

 [1 Thessalonians 4] 

##### Advice on Daily Life #####

[4:1] Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.[4:2] For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.

[4:3] For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;[4:4] each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,[4:5] and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;[4:6] none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.[4:7] For God’s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity.[4:8] Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.

[4:9] As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;[4:10] and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.

Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more.[4:11] Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;[4:12] so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.

##### The Dead in Christ at the coming of the Lord #####

[4:13] We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.[4:14] For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.[4:15] This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.[4:16] For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.[4:17] Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterward we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.[4:18] Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.

 [1 Thessalonians 5] 

[5:1] But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.[5:2] You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.[5:3] When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape![5:4] You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.[5:5] For you all are children of light and children of the day.

We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.[5:6] Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.[5:7] It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.[5:8] But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.[5:9] For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,[5:10] that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.[5:11] Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.

##### Conclusion #####

[5:12] We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord’s service, and give you counsel.[5:13] Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.[5:14] We entreat you also, friends – warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone.[5:15] Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone.[5:16] Always be joyful;[5:17] never cease to pray;[5:18] under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.[5:19] Do not quench the Spirit;[5:20] do not make light of preaching.[5:21] Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;[5:22] shun every form of evil.[5:23] May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.[5:24] He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.

[5:25] Friends, pray for us.

[5:26] Greet all the Lord’s followers with a sacred kiss.[5:27] I order you in the Lord’s name to have this letter read to all the brethren.

[5:28] May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.


Paul’s Second Letter to the
---------------------------

Thessalonians
=============

 [2 Thessalonians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.[1:2] May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

##### The Apostle and his Converts #####

[1:3] Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.[1:4] So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.[1:5] These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;[1:6] since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,[1:7] and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.[1:8] Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.[1:9] They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin – banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,[1:10] when he comes to be honored in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) – as he will be on that day.[1:11] With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.[1:12] Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honored in you, and you in him.

 [2 Thessalonians 2] 

##### Events that must precede the Lord’s Coming #####

[2:1] As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,[2:2] not lightly to let your minds become unsettled, or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message, or by any letter, purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.[2:3] Do not let anyone deceive you, whatever he may do. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of that Incarnation of Wickedness, that Lost Soul,[2:4] who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God![2:5] Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?[2:6] And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.[2:7] Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret; but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.[2:8] Then will ‘Wickedness Incarnate’ appear, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his lips, and annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.[2:9] For at the coming of the Lord there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –[2:10] to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.[2:11] That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;[2:12] so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.

[2:13] But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.[2:14] To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.[2:15] Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.[2:16] And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,[2:17] console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.

 [2 Thessalonians 3] 

##### Conclusion #####

[3:1] In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;[3:2] and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.[3:3] But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.[3:4] Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.[3:5] May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.

[3:6] We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.[3:7] For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,[3:8] nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.[3:9] This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.[3:10] Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’[3:11] We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.[3:12] All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.[3:13] You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.[3:14] If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.[3:15] Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.[3:16] May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.

[3:17] I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.[3:18] May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.


Paul’s First Letter to
----------------------

Timothy
=======

 [1 Timothy 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope.[1:2] To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

[1:3] I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,[1:4] nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.[1:5] The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.[1:6] And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.[1:7] They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.[1:8] We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,[1:9] by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,[1:10] for the immoral, for perverts, for slave-dealers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –[1:11] as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.

[1:12] I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,[1:13] though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;[1:14] and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.[1:15] How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’! And there is no greater sinner than I![1:16] Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterward to believe on him and attain eternal life.[1:17] To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

[1:18] This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,[1:19] with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.[1:20] Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.

 [1 Timothy 2]

[2:1] First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,[2:2] especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.[2:3] This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,[2:4] whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.[2:5] There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,[2:6] who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.

This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;[2:7] and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.

[2:8] My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.

[2:9] I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,[2:10] but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.[2:11] They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.[2:12] I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.[2:13] Adam was formed first, not Eve.[2:14] And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.[2:15] But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.

 [1 Timothy 3] 

[3:1] How true is this saying:‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’[3:2] The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher,[3:3] not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;[3:4] they should provide for own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.[3:5] If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?[3:6] The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil.[3:7] They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.[3:8] So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,[3:9] but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.[3:10] They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.[3:11] It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.[3:12] Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.[3:13] Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.

##### Special Directions to Timothy #####

[3:14] I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;[3:15] but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the Household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.[3:16] Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for –

|  ‘He was revealed in our nature,
|    Pronounced righteous in spirit,
|      Seen by angels,
|  Proclaimed among the Gentiles,
|    Believed on in the world,
|      Taken up into glory.’

 [1 Timothy 4] 

[4:1] But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,[4:2] who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,[4:3] and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.[4:4] Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;[4:5] for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.

[4:6] Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.[4:7] As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;[4:8] for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.[4:9] How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance![4:10] With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.

[4:11] Remember these things in your teaching.[4:12] Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.[4:13] Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.[4:14] Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.[4:15] Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.[4:16] Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.

 [1 Timothy 5] 

[5:1] Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,[5:2] the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.[5:3] Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.[5:4] But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.[5:5] As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.[5:6] But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.[5:7] Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.[5:8] Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.[5:9] A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,[5:10] and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.[5:11] But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,[5:12] and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.[5:13] And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.[5:14] Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.[5:15] There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.[5:16] Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.

[5:17] Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.[5:18] The words of scripture are –

|  ‘You should not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.’

and again –

|   ‘The worker is worth their wages.’ 

[5:19] Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;[5:20] but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.[5:21] I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.[5:22] Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrong-doing of others. Keep your life pure.[5:23] Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.[5:24] There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.[5:25] In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.

 [1 Timothy 6] 

[6:1] All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.[6:2] Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.

##### Conclusion #####

Those are the things to insist on in your teaching.

[6:3] Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,[6:4] is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarreling, recriminations, base suspicions,[6:5] and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.[6:6] Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment![6:7] For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.[6:8] So, with food and shelter, we will be content.[6:9] Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.[6:10] Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.

[6:11] But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.[6:12] Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.[6:13] I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –[6:14] I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.[6:15] This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,[6:16] who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honor and power for ever. Amen.

[6:17] Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.[6:18] Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,[6:19] storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.

[6:20] Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall ‘theology,’[6:21] for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray.

God bless you all.


Paul’s Second Letter to
-----------------------

Timothy
=======

 [2 Timothy 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,[1:2] to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

[1:3] I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,[1:4] as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,[1:5] now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.[1:6] And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.[1:7] For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.[1:8] Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.[1:9] It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,[1:10] and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and Immortality to light by that good news,[1:11] of which I was myself appointed a herald and apostle, and teacher.[1:12] That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.[1:13] Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.[1:14] Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.

[1:15] You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.[1:16] May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.[1:17] On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.[1:18] The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.

 [2 Timothy 2] 

##### Injunctions to Timothy #####

[2:1] You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;[2:2] and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.[2:3] Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.[2:4] A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.[2:5] No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.[2:6] The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.[2:7] Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.[2:8] Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;[2:9] in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;[2:10] and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.[2:11] How true this saying is – ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.[2:12] If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.[2:13] If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’

[2:14] Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.[2:15] Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.[2:16] Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,[2:17] and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.[2:18] They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.[2:19] Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription –

|  ‘THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS’;

and this –

|  ‘LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.’

[2:20] Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.[2:21] If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.[2:22] Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.[2:23] Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;[2:24] and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing.[2:25] They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,[2:26] and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God.

 [2 Timothy 3] 


[3:1] Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.[3:2] People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,[3:3] incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,[3:4] treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;[3:5] and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.[3:6] For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,[3:7] are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.[3:8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.[3:9] They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.[3:10] But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,[3:11] as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all![3:12] Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;[3:13] but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.[3:14] You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;[3:15] and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.[3:16] All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;[3:17] so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.

 [2 Timothy 4] 

[4:1] I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:[4:2] Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.[4:3] For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.[4:4] They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.[4:5] But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.

[4:6] As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.[4:7] I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.[4:8] And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing.

##### Conclusion #####

[4:9] Do your utmost to come to me soon;[4:10] for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.[4:11] There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.[4:12] I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.[4:13] Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.[4:14] Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.[4:15] You must also on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.[4:16] At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them![4:17] But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.[4:18] The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen.

[4:19] Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.[4:20] Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.[4:21] Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers.

[4:22] May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.


Paul’s Letter to
----------------

Titus
=====

 [Titus 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness[1:2] – and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,[1:3] and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.[1:4] To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace.

##### Mission of Titus in Crete #####

[1:5] My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.[1:6] They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.[1:7] For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.[1:8] Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,[1:9] holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.

[1:10] For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.[1:11] They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.[1:12] It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true.[1:13] Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,[1:14] and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.[1:15] To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.[1:16] They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.

 [Titus 2] 


[2:1] You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.[2:2] Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.[2:3] So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.[2:4] They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,[2:5] and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.[2:6] In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.[2:7] In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –[2:8] let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.[2:9] Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.[2:10] Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do.

[2:11] For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,[2:12] leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,[2:13] while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.[2:14] For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.[2:15] Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.

 [Titus 3] 

[3:1] Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,[3:2] to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.[3:3] There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.[3:4] But, when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,[3:5] not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,[3:6] which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior –[3:7] so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.[3:8] This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.[3:9] But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.[3:10] If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.[3:11] You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned.

##### Conclusion #####

[3:12] As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.[3:13] Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.[3:14] Let all our people learn to devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their lives may not be unfruitful.

[3:15] All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting to our friends in the faith.

God bless you all.

Philemon
========

 [Philemon 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.[1:2] To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;[1:3] may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

##### Request regarding runaway slave #####

[1:4] I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,[1:5] because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;[1:6] and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.[1:7] I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s People have been cheered, friend, by you.

[1:8] And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,[1:9] yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.[1:10] I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.[1:11] Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;[1:12] and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart.[1:13] For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.[1:14] But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.[1:15] It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,[1:16] no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian![1:17] If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.[1:18] If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.[1:19] I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.[1:20] Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.

[1:21] Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.[1:22] Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.

##### Messages and Blessing #####

[1:23] Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;[1:24] and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.

[1:25] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

Hebrews

 [Hebrews 1] 

##### Christ the Mediator #####

[1:1] God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,[1:2] has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.[1:3] For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he took his seat at the right hand of God’s Majesty on high,[1:4] having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.

[1:5] For to which of the angels did God ever say –

|  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’?

or again –

|  ‘I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son’?

[1:6] And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said –

|  ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’

[1:7] Speaking of the angels, he said –

|  ‘He makes the winds his angels
|    And the flames of fire his servants’;

[1:8] while of the Son he said –

|  ‘God is your throne for ever and ever;
|    The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice;
|  [1:9] You love righteousness and hates iniquity;
|    Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.’

[1:10] Again –

|  ‘You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,
|  and the heavens are the work of your hands.
|    [1:11] They will perish, but you remain;
|  as a garment they will all grow old;
|  [1:12] As a mantle you will fold them up,
|  and as a garment they will be changed,
|    but you are the same, and your years will know no end.’

[1:13] To which of the angels has God ever said –

|  ‘Sit you at my right hand
|    until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’?

[1:14] Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?

 [Hebrews 2] 

[2:1] Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.[2:2] For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,[2:3] how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,[2:4] while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.

[2:5] God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking![2:6] No; a writer has declared somewhere –

|  ‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them?
|    Or human beings that you should care for them?
|  [2:7] You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;
|    With glory and honor you have crowned them;
|  You have set them over all that your hands have made;
|    [2:8] You have placed all things beneath their feet.’

This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.[2:9] What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.[2:10] It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.[2:11] For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.[2:12] He says –

|  ‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,
|  In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’

[2:13] And again –

|  ‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’

And yet again –

|  ‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’

[2:14] Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –[2:15] and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.[2:16] It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.[2:17] And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.[2:18] The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.

 [Hebrews 3] 


[3:1] Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.[3:2] See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.[3:3] He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.[3:4] For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.[3:5] While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,[3:6] the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.

[3:7] Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says –

|  ‘If today you hear God’s voice,
|  [3:8] harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me
|    On the day when they tried my patience in the desert,
|  [3:9] Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,
|    And saw my mighty deeds for forty years.
|  [3:10] Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,
|  And I said – “Their hearts are always straying;
|    They have never learned my ways”;
|  [3:11] While in my wrath I swore –
|    “They will never enter upon my rest.”’

[3:12] Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.[3:13] Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.[3:14] For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.[3:15] To use the words of scripture –

|  ‘If today you hear God’s voice,
|  Harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.’

[3:16] Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?[3:17] And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?[3:18] And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?[3:19] We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.

 [Hebrews 4] 

[4:1] We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.[4:2] For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.[4:3] Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said –

|  ‘In my wrath I swore –
|    “They will never enter upon my rest;”’

Although God’s work was finished at the creation of the world;[4:4] for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words –

|  ‘God rested on the seventh day after all his work.’

[4:5] On the other hand, we read in that passage –

|  ‘They will never enter upon my rest.’

[4:6] Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,[4:7] again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted –

|  ‘If today you hear God’s voice
|  Harden not your hearts.’

[4:8] Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.[4:9] There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.[4:10] For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.[4:11] Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.[4:12] God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.[4:13] There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.

[4:14] We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.[4:15] Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.[4:16] Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.

 [Hebrews 5] 


[5:1] Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.[5:2] And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,[5:3] and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.[5:4] Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.[5:5] In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him –

|  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’;

[5:6] and on another occasion also –

|  ‘You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.’

[5:7] Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.[5:8] Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;[5:9] and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,[5:10] while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.

[5:11] Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.[5:12] For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’[5:13] For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.[5:14] But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.

 [Hebrews 6] 

[6:1] Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –[6:2] teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.[6:3] Yes and, with God’s help, we will.[6:4] For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,[6:5] and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –[6:6] if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.[6:7] Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;[6:8] but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.

[6:9] But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.[6:10] For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.[6:11] But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.[6:12] Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.

[6:13] When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.[6:14] His words were –

|  ‘I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.’

[6:15] And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.[6:16] People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.[6:17] And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.[6:18] For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.[6:19] This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,[6:20] where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.

 [Hebrews 7] 

##### Paramount Priesthood of the Christ #####

[7:1] It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;[7:2] and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’[7:3] There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.

[7:4] Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.[7:5] Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.[7:6] But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.[7:7] Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.[7:8] In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.[7:9] Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;[7:10] for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.

[7:11] If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?[7:12] With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.[7:13] And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.[7:14] For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.[7:15] All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,[7:16] and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;[7:17] for that is the meaning of the declaration –

|  ‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’

[7:18] On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless[7:19] (for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.[7:20] Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,[7:21] but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him –

|  ‘The Lord has sworn, and will not change, “You are a priest for all time.”’

[7:22] And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.[7:23] Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;[7:24] but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.[7:25] And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.

[7:26] This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,[7:27] one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.[7:28] The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.

 [Hebrews 8] 

[8:1] To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,[8:2] where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.[8:3] Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.[8:4] If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.[8:5] (These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)[8:6] But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.[8:7] If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.[8:8] But, finding fault with the people, God says –

|  ‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,
|    “When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah –
|  [8:9] Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors
|    On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
|  For they did not abide by their covenant with me,
|    And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord.
|  [8:10] “This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel
|    After those days,” says the Lord.
|  “I will impress my laws on their minds,
|    And will inscribe them on their hearts;
|  And I will be their God,
|    And they will be my people.
|  [8:11] There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,
|    Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’;
|  For everyone will know me,
|    From the lowest to the highest.
|  [8:12] For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings,
|    And I will no longer remember their sins.”’

[8:13] By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.

 [Hebrews 9] 

##### The New Revelation and the Old #####

[9:1] It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.[9:2] For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.[9:3] The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.[9:4] In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;[9:5] while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.[9:6] Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;[9:7] but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.[9:8] By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.[9:9] For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;[9:10] the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.

[9:11] But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.[9:12] Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.[9:13] For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),[9:14] how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God![9:15] And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.[9:16] Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.[9:17] For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.[9:18] This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.[9:19] For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,[9:20] saying, as he did so – “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”[9:21] And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.[9:22] Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.

[9:23] While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.[9:24] For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.[9:25] Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;[9:26] for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.[9:27] And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),[9:28] so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.

 [Hebrews 10] 


[10:1] The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.[10:2] Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?[10:3] But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.[10:4] For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.[10:5] That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared –

|  ‘Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body;
|    [10:6] You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
|  [10:7] So I said, “See, I have come” (as is written of me in the pages of the book),
|    “To do your will, God.”’

[10:8] First come the words – ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the Law),[10:9] and then there is added – ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.[10:10] And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.[10:11] Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.[10:12] But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’[10:13] and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’[10:14] By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.[10:15] We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying –

|  [10:16] ‘“This is the covenant that I will make with them
|    After those days,” says the Lord;
|  “I will impress my laws on their hearts,
|    And will inscribe them on their minds,”’

[10:17] then we have –

|  ‘And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember.’

[10:18] And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin.

##### Encouragement and Warning #####

[10:19] Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,[10:20] by the way which he inaugurated for us – a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);[10:21] and, since we have in him ‘a great priest set over the house of God,’[10:22] let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.[10:23] Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.[10:24] Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.[10:25] And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.[10:26] Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;[10:27] there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.[10:28] When someone disregarded the Law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.[10:29] How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?[10:30] We know who it was that said –

|  ‘It is for me to avenge, I will requite’;

and again –

|  ‘The Lord will judge his people.’

[10:31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

[10:32] Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.[10:33] Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.[10:34] For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.[10:35] Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.[10:36] You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.

|  [10:37] ‘For there is indeed but a very little while
|    Ere He who is coming will have come, without delay;
|  [10:38] And through faith the righteous will find life,
|    But, if anyone draws back, my heart can find no pleasure in them.’

[10:39] But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.

 [Hebrews 11] 

##### Heroes of Faith #####

[11:1] Faith is the realization of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.[11:2] And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.[11:3] Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.[11:4] Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.[11:5] Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;[11:6] but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.

[11:7] It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.

[11:8] It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterward to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.[11:9] It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.[11:10] For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.

[11:11] Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for child-bearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.[11:12] And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous ‘as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.’

[11:13] All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only aliens and strangers on the earth.[11:14] Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.[11:15] If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.[11:16] But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.[11:17] It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,[11:18] of whom it had been said –

|  ‘It is through Isaac that there will be descendants to bear your name.’

[11:19] For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.[11:20] It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.[11:21] Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and ‘to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.’[11:22] Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.[11:23] Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.[11:24] It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of ‘son of a daughter of Pharaoh.’[11:25] He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.[11:26] For he counted ‘the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ’ of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.[11:27] Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.[11:28] Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.[11:29] Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.[11:30] Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.[11:31] Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.

[11:32] Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.[11:33] By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,[11:34] quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.[11:35] Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.[11:36] Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.[11:37] They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –[11:38] people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.[11:39] Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfillment of God’s promise;[11:40] since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us.

 [Hebrews 12] 


[12:1] Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,[12:2] our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God.[12:3] Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.[12:4] You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;[12:5] and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children –

|  ‘My child, think not lightly of the Lord’s discipline,
|    Do not despond when he rebukes you;
|  [12:6] For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines,
|    And he chastises every child whom he acknowledges.’

[12:7] It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?[12:8] If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.[12:9] Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?[12:10] Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.[12:11] No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.[12:12] Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;[12:13] make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.

##### Conclusion #####

[12:14] Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.[12:15] Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.[12:16] Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.[12:17] For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears.

[12:18] It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm,[12:19] and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,[12:20] for they could not bear to think of the command – ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’[12:21] and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – ‘I tremble with fear.’[12:22] No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,[12:23] to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,[12:24] to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.[12:25] Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.[12:26] Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is –

|  ‘Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.’

[12:27] And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.[12:28] Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.[12:29] For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’

 [Hebrews 13] 

[13:1] Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.[13:2] Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.[13:3] Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.[13:4] Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.[13:5] Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said –

|  ‘I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you.’

[13:6] Therefore we may say with confidence –

|  ‘The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.
|    What can mere people do to me?’

[13:7] Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.

[13:8] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever![13:9] Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.[13:10] We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.[13:11] The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.[13:12] And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.[13:13] Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;[13:14] for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.[13:15] Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.[13:16] Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.[13:17] Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.

[13:18] Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.[13:19] And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.

[13:20] May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord –[13:21] may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.

[13:22] I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you.

[13:23] You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.

[13:24] Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.

[13:25] May God bless you all.


The Letter from

James
=====

 [James 1] 

##### Greeting #####

[1:1] James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad.

##### Advice on Various Subjects #####

[1:2] My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,[1:3] knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.[1:4] And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.

[1:5] If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.[1:6] But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –[1:7] Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,[1:8] vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.

[1:9] Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,[1:10] but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.[1:11] As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.

[1:12] Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.[1:13] Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.[1:14] A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.[1:15] Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.[1:16] Do not be deceived, my dear friends.[1:17] Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.[1:18] Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation.

[1:19] Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;[1:20] for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.[1:21] Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.[1:22] Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.[1:23] For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.[1:24] They look at themselves, then go on their way,[1:25] but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.[1:26] When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.[1:27] That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.

 [James 2] 

##### Warning on Various Subjects #####

[2:1] My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?[2:2] Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,[2:3] and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”[2:4] Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?[2:5] Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?[2:6] But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?[2:7] Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?[2:8] If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;[2:9] but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.[2:10] For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.[2:11] He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.[2:12] Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’[2:13] For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.

[2:14] My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?[2:15] Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,[2:16] and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?[2:17] In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.[2:18] Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.”

“Then show me your faith,” I reply, “apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.”[2:19] It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.[2:20] Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?[2:21] Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?[2:22] You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;[2:23] and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”[2:24] You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.[2:25] Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?[2:26] Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.

 [James 3] 

[3:1] Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.[3:2] We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.[3:3] When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.[3:4] Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.[3:5] So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze![3:6] And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.[3:7] For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,[3:8] no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison![3:9] With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’[3:10] From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.[3:11] Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?[3:12] Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.

[3:13] Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.[3:14] But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.[3:15] That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.[3:16] For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.[3:17] But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.[3:18] Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace.

 [James 4] 


[4:1] What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?[4:2] You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.[4:3] You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.[4:4] Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.[4:5] Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’[4:6] But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, –

|  ‘God opposes the haughty,
|    but gives grace to the humble.’

[4:7] Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.[4:8] Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators![4:9] Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom![4:10] Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.[4:11] Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.[4:12] There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor?

[4:13] Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’[4:14] yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.[4:15] Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’[4:16] But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.[4:17] The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them.

 [James 5] 

[5:1] Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you![5:2] Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.[5:3] Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.[5:4] Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts![5:5] You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.[5:6] You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?

##### Concluding Appeal #####

[5:7] Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.[5:8] And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.[5:9] Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door![5:10] Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.[5:11] We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’

[5:12] Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.

[5:13] If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.[5:14] If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.[5:15] The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.[5:16] Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.[5:17] Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.[5:18] And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.[5:19] My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,[5:20] be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.


Peter’s First Letter

 [1 Peter 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,[1:2] and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure.

##### The Christian’s Hope of Salvation #####

[1:3] Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,[1:4] given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –[1:5] for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.[1:6] At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;[1:7] that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.[1:8] Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,[1:9] as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls![1:10] It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;[1:11] as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.[1:12] And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look.

##### The Christian’s Character #####

[1:13] Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.[1:14] Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,[1:15] but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.[1:16] For scripture says –

|  ‘You will be holy, because I am holy.’

[1:17] And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.[1:18] For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,[1:19] but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.[1:20] Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,[1:21] who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God.

[1:22] Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;[1:23] since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.[1:24] For –

|  ‘All earthly life is but as grass,
|    and all its splendor as the flower of grass.
|  The grass fades,
|    its flower falls,
|      [1:25] but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’

And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you.

 [1 Peter 2] 

[2:1] Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,[2:2] like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –[2:3] since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’[2:4] Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;[2:5] and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.[2:6] For there is a passage of scripture that runs –

|  ‘See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious corner-stone;
|    And those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.’

[2:7] It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’[2:8] and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.[2:9] But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.[2:10] Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’

##### Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times. #####

[2:11] Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.[2:12] Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’

[2:13] Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,[2:14] and to governors as sent by him to punish evil-doers and to commend those who do right.[2:15] For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.[2:16] Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.[2:17] Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’

[2:18] Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.[2:19] For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.[2:20] What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.[2:21] For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.[2:22] He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’[2:23] He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.[2:24] And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’[2:25] Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.

 [1 Peter 3] 

[3:1] Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,[3:2] as they see your pure, reverent conduct.[3:3] Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses,[3:4] but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.[3:5] It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,[3:6] as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.

[3:7] Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.

[3:8] Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;[3:9] never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing!

|  [3:10] ‘The person who wants to enjoy life
|    And see happy days –
|  They should keep their tongue from evil
|    And their lips from deceitful words,
|  [3:11] they should turn from evil and do good,
|    They should seek for peace and follow after it;
|  [3:12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
|    And his ears are attentive to their prayers,
|      But the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.’

[3:13] Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?[3:14] Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’[3:15] Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,[3:16] and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.[3:17] It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.[3:18] For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.[3:19] And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,[3:20] who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.[3:21] And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,[3:22] who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him.

 [1 Peter 4] 

[4:1] Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,[4:2] and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.[4:3] Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.[4:4] And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.[4:5] But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.[4:6] For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.

[4:7] But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.[4:8] Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’[4:9] Never grudge hospitality to one another.[4:10] Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.[4:11] When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen.

[4:12] Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.[4:13] No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.[4:14] If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.[4:15] I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.[4:16] But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name.[4:17] For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?[4:18] If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’[4:19] Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.

 [1 Peter 5] 

##### Conclusion #####

[5:1] As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –[5:2] I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;[5:3] not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.[5:4] Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.[5:5] Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’

[5:6] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,[5:7] laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.[5:8] Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.[5:9] Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.[5:10] God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.[5:11] To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.

[5:12] I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.[5:13] Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.[5:14] Greet one another with the kiss of love.

May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.


Peter’s Second Letter
=====================

 [2 Peter 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

[1:2] May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.[1:3] For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.[1:4] For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.[1:5] Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,[1:6] knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,[1:7] piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.[1:8] For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.[1:9] Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past![1:10] Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.[1:11] For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

##### The Transfiguration and the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ #####

[1:12] I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.[1:13] But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this ‘tent,’ to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;[1:14] for I know that the time for this ‘tent’ of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.[1:15] So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.[1:16] For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.[1:17] For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’[1:18] These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.[1:19] And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.[1:20] But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;[1:21] for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

 [2 Peter 2] 

##### Warning against separating Christianity from a Holy Life #####

[2:1] But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.[2:2] There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.[2:3] In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.[2:4] Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.[2:5] Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.[2:6] He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;[2:7] but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbors;[2:8] for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.[2:9] The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for ‘the day of judgment’ –[2:10] especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,[2:11] even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.[2:12] These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,[2:13] suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.[2:14] They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.[2:15] Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing,[2:16] but was rebuked for his offense. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.[2:17] These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.[2:18] With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.[2:19] They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.[2:20] If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.[2:21] It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.[2:22] In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – ‘A dog returns to what it has vomited’ and ‘A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.’

 [2 Peter 3] 

##### A Reassertion of the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ #####

[3:1] This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.[3:2] I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Savior given to you through your apostles.[3:3] First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,[3:4] will come and ask scoffingly – ‘Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!’[3:5] For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;[3:6] and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.[3:7] But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.

[3:8] But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.[3:9] The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.[3:10] The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.[3:11] Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,[3:12] while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon^[ 3:12 Or: and desire its coming.]. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,[3:13] but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God.

[3:14] Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.[3:15] Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.[3:16] It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.[3:17] You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;[3:18] and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.


John’s First Letter
===================

 [1 John 1] 

##### Preface #####

[1:1] We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.[1:2] That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.[1:3] It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.[1:4] We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete.

##### Fellowship with God #####

[1:5] This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.[1:6] If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.[1:7] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.[1:8] If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.[1:9] If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing.[1:10] If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us.

 [1 John 2] 

[2:1] My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous.[2:2] He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.[2:3] It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him.[2:4] Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.[2:5] But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:[2:6] whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.

##### A new commandment #####

[2:7] Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard.[2:8] Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.[2:9] The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.[2:10] The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.[2:11] The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.

##### Those who know God should not love the world #####



|  [2:12] Little children, I am writing to you
|    because your sins have been forgiven for Christ’s sake.
|  [2:13] Parents, I am writing to you
|    because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning.
|  Young people, I am writing to you
|    because you have conquered the evil one.
|  Children, I write to you
|    because you have come to know the Father.
|  [2:14] Parents, I write to you
|    because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning.
|  Young people, I write to you
|    because you are strong,
|    and God’s message is always in your hearts,
|    and you have conquered the evil one.

[2:15] Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.[2:16] For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.[2:17] And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever.

##### Warnings against an antichrist #####

[2:18] My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour.[2:19] These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us.[2:20] You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth.[2:21] I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.

[2:22] Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son.[2:23] No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also.[2:24] As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.[2:25] And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life!

[2:26] In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.[2:27] As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him.[2:28] Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming.[2:29] Since you know he is righteous, you realize that everyone who does what is right is his child.

 [1 John 3] 

##### God’s Children #####

[3:1] See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.[3:2] Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.[3:3] And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.

[3:4] Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.[3:5] You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.[3:6] No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.[3:7] My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.[3:8] The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.

[3:9] No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.[3:10] By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.[3:11] For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another.[3:12] We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.

##### Love each other #####

[3:13] Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you.[3:14] We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death.[3:15] The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.

[3:16] This is how we know that love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other.[3:17] If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?[3:18] My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions.

[3:19] This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence:[3:20] though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.[3:21] Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,[3:22] and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him.[3:23] His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us.[3:24] The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us.

 [1 John 4] 

##### True and False Inspiration #####

[4:1] Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

[4:2] This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,[4:3] while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world!

[4:4] You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.[4:5] Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.[4:6] We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.

##### God is love #####

[4:7] Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.[4:8] Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.[4:9] This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.[4:10] This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

[4:11] Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.[4:12] No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.[4:13] We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.[4:14] Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.[4:15] Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.[4:16] And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us.

God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.[4:17] This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.[4:18] There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.[4:19] We love, because God first loved us.[4:20] If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.[4:21] Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.

 [1 John 5] 

##### Faith and Confidence #####

[5:1] Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.[5:2] By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.[5:3] For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,[5:4] for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith![5:5] Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?[5:6] Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.[5:7] Indeed three testify:[5:8] the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree.[5:9] We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.[5:10] The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.[5:11] And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.[5:12] Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life.

##### Final words #####

[5:13] I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.[5:14] We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.[5:15] And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours.[5:16] If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.[5:17] All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.

[5:18] We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them.[5:19] We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.[5:20] We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.[5:21] My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.


John’s Second Letter
====================

 [2 John 1] 

##### Greetings #####

[1:1] From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well.[1:2] We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever.

[1:3] Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours – the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son – in truth and love.

##### Live in truth and love #####

[1:4] It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.[1:5] And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. – Let us love one another.[1:6] And this is love – to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love.[1:7] I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world – men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist.[1:8] Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward.[1:9] Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching – they have both the Father and the Son.[1:10] If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them;[1:11] because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work.

##### Final words #####

[1:12] Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.[1:13] The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.


John’s Third Letter
===================

 [3 John 1] 

##### Greetings #####

[1:1] From the elder to his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves.

[1:2] Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health – I know that all is well with your soul.[1:3] For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.[1:4] Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.

##### Gaius #####

[1:5] Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other followers – even when they are strangers to you.[1:6] They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.[1:7] For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.[1:8] Therefore, we should support people like them, and so take our share in their work for the truth.

##### Diotrephes and Demetrius #####

[1:9] I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be the leader among them) doesn’t welcome us.[1:10] So if I come, I will bring up his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that, he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers, but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church.

[1:11] Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.[1:12] Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say is true.

##### Final words #####

[1:13] I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and ink.[1:14] I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face.[1:15] Peace be with you. The friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one of our friends.


The Letter from
---------------

Jude
====

 [Jude 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To those who, having received the call, have been loved by God the Father and protected by Jesus Christ, From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James.[1:2] May mercy, peace, and love be yours in ever increasing measure.

##### Warnings against moral corruption #####

[1:3] Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to encourage you to fight in defense of the faith that has once for all been entrusted to the keeping of Christ’s people.[1:4] For there have crept in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ.

[1:5] Now I want to remind you – but you already know it all – that, though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterward destroyed those who refused to believe in him;[1:6] and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains and black darkness.[1:7] Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, punishment in eternal fire.

[1:8] Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial beings.[1:9] Yet even Michael, the archangel, when, in his dispute with the devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge him with maligning, but said merely ‘The Lord rebuke you!’[1:10] But these people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.[1:11] Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam’s love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like Korah.[1:12] These are the people who are blots on your ‘love-feasts,’ when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;[1:13] they are wild sea waves, foaming with their own shame; they are ‘wandering stars,’ for which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever.

[1:14] To these people, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, declared – ‘See! The Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones around him,[1:15] to execute judgment on all people, and to convict all godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken against him, godless sinners that they are!’

[1:16] These people are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot; they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words on their lips; and they flatter others for the sake of what they can get from them.

[1:17] But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;[1:18] how they used to say to you – ‘As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.’[1:19] These are the people – animal and unspiritual – who cause divisions.[1:20] But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,[1:21] and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life.[1:22] To some show pity, because they are in doubt. ‘Drag them out of the fire,’ and save them.[1:23] To others show pity, but with caution, hating the clothing polluted by their touch.

##### Ascription #####

[1:24] To him who is able to guard you from falling, and to bring you into his glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing –[1:25] to the one God, our Savior, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, glory, majesty, power, and dominion, as it was before time began, is now, and will be for all time to come. Amen.


The Revelation to John
======================

 [Revelation 1] 

[1:1] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,[1:2] who testified to the message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.[1:3] Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for the time is near.

##### Messages to the Seven Churches #####

[1:4] From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,[1:5] and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood –[1:6] and he made us a kingdom of priests in the service of God, his Father! – to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.[1:7] He is coming among the clouds! Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. So will it be. Amen.

[1:8]  ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’  says the Lord,  the God who is, and who was, and who will be, the Almighty. 

[1:9] I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.[1:10] I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.[1:11] It said –  ‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicaea.’ [1:12] I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,[1:13] and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.[1:14] The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;[1:15] and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,[1:16] in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power.[1:17] And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said –  ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, [1:18]  the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and of Hades. [1:19]  Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place – [1:20]  the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven churches. 

 [Revelation 2] 

[2:1]  “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write

  These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks among the seven golden lamps: [2:2]  I know your life, your toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evil-doers. I know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are apostles, though they are not, and how you proved them false. [2:3]  You possess endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary. [2:4]  But this I have against you – You have abandoned your first love. [2:5]  Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp from its place, unless you repent. [2:6]  But this is in your favor – You hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it. [2:7]  Anyone with ears should hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him who conquers – to him I will give the right to eat the fruit of the Tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God. 

[2:8]  “To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:

  These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died, but is restored to life: [2:9]  I know your persecution and your poverty – yet you are rich! I know, too, the slander that comes from those who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 2:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are a congregation of Satan. [2:10]  Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life. [2:11]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Those who conquer will suffer no hurt from the Second Death. 

[2:12]  “To the angel of the church in Pergamus write:

  These are the words of him who holds the sharp two-edged sword: [2:13]  I know where you live, where the throne of Satan stands. And yet you hold to my name, and you did not disown my faith even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death among you where Satan dwells. [2:14]  Yet I have a few things against you – You have among you those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts. [2:15]  Again you have among you those who hold in the same way to the teaching of the Nikolaitans. [2:16]  Therefore repent, or else, I will come quickly and contend with such people with words that will cut like a sword. [2:17]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To those who conquer – to them I will give a share of the mystic manna, and I will give them a white stone; and on the stone will be inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the person who receives it. 

[2:18]  “To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:

  These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire, and whose feet are like brass: [2:19]  I know your life, your love, faith, service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been better than it was at first. [2:20]  Yet I have this against you – You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings. [2:21]  I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness. [2:22]  Therefore I am laying her on a bed of sickness, and bringing great suffering on those who are unfaithful with her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers. [2:23]  I will also put her children to death; and all the churches will learn that I am he who looks into people’s hearts and souls; and I will give to each one of you what their life deserves. [2:24]  But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira – all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn the secrets of Satan, as people call them – I am not laying on you any further burden; [2:25]  only hold fast to what you have received, until I come. [2:26]  To those who conquer and are careful to live my life to the end – to them I will give authority over the nations, [2:27]  and they will rule them with an iron rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces (as I myself have received from my Father) [2:28]  and I will give them the morning star. [2:29]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. 

 [Revelation 3] 


[3:1]  “To the angel of the church in Sardis write:

  These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars; – I know your life, and that people say of you that you are living, though you are dead. [3:2]  Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God. [3:3]  Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you. [3:4]  Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy. [3:5]  Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes, and I will not strike their name out of the book of life; but I will own them before my Father, and before his angels. [3:6]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. 

[3:7]  “To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:

  These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the Key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens: [3:8]  I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name. [3:9]  Listen, I give some of the congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 3:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are lying – I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will learn that I loved you. [3:10]  Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth. [3:11]  I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may take your crown. [3:12]  Those who conquer – I will make them a pillar in the Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will write on them my new name. [3:13]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. 

[3:14]  “To the angel of the church in Laodicaea write:

  These are the words of the Unchanging One, the witness faithful and true, the beginning of the Creation of God: [3:15]  I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot! [3:16]  But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth. [3:17]  You say ‘I am rich and have grown rich, and I want for nothing,’ and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked! [3:18]  Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. [3:19]  All whom I love I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent. [3:20]  I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me. [3:21]  To those who conquer – to them I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, as I, when I conquered, took my seat beside my Father on his throne. [3:22]  Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.” 

 [Revelation 4] 

##### The Vision of the Seven Seals #####

[4:1] After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’[4:2] Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.[4:3] He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and around the throne there was a rainbow of the color of an emerald.[4:4] And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.[4:5] Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;[4:6] and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.[4:7] The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.[4:8] These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say –

|  ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.’

[4:9] And, whenever these creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,[4:10] the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying –

|  [4:11] ‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’

 [Revelation 5] 

[5:1] Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;[5:2] and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’[5:3] But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.[5:4] At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.[5:5] But one of the elders said to me – ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’

[5:6] Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)[5:7] The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.[5:8] And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)[5:9] And they are singing a new song –

|  ‘You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,[5:10] and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’

[5:11] Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,[5:12] and they cried in a loud voice –

|  ‘Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and praise, and blessing.’

[5:13] And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying –

|  ‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’

[5:14] And the four creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped.

 [Revelation 6] 


[6:1] Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – ‘Come.’[6:2] And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.

[6:3] When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – ‘Come.’[6:4] Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.

[6:5] When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.[6:6] And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’

[6:7] When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – ‘Come.’[6:8] And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.

[6:9] When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.[6:10] They cried in a loud voice – ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’[6:11] Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.

[6:12] And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.[6:13] The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.[6:14] The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.[6:15] Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;[6:16] and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,[6:17] for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’

 [Revelation 7] 

[7:1] After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.[7:2] And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –[7:3] ‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’[7:4] I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.

|  [7:5] From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,
|  from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
|  [7:6] from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Napthali twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
|  [7:7] from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
|  [7:8] from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,
|  from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.

[7:9] After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.[7:10] And they are crying in a loud voice –

|  ‘Salvation be ascribed to our God who is seated on his throne and to the Lamb.’

[7:11] And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,[7:12] saying –

|  ‘Amen. Blessing and praise, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.’


[7:13] Then one of the elders turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’

[7:14] ‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’

‘These,’ he said, ‘are they who come through the Great Persecution; they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.[7:15] And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.[7:16] Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;[7:17] for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’

 [Revelation 8] 

[8:1] As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.

##### Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts #####

[8:2] Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

[8:3] Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.[8:4] The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.[8:5] Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.[8:6] Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.

[8:7] The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.

[8:8] Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,[8:9] and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.

[8:10] Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.[8:11] (The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.

[8:12] Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.

[8:13] And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’

 [Revelation 9] 

[9:1] Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.[9:2] He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.[9:3] Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.[9:4] They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.[9:5] Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.[9:6] In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.[9:7] In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,[9:8] and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,[9:9] and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.[9:10] They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.[9:11] They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer).

[9:12] The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!

[9:13] Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.[9:14] It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’[9:15] Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.[9:16] The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.[9:17] And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulfur.[9:18] Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur that issued from their mouths;[9:19] for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.[9:20] But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;[9:21] and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.

 [Revelation 10] 

[10:1] Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;[10:2] in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;[10:3] and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.[10:4] And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’[10:5] Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,[10:6] and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.[10:7] Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.[10:8] Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – ‘Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.’[10:9] So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said ‘Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’[10:10] I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.[10:11] And I was told – ‘You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.’

 [Revelation 11] 

[11:1] Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.[11:2] But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.[11:3] Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’[11:4] These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.[11:5] When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.[11:6] These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.[11:7] As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.[11:8] Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified.[11:9] People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.[11:10] Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.[11:11] After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.[11:12] The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.[11:13] At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.

[11:14] The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!

[11:15] Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying –

|  ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.’

[11:16] At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped Him,[11:17] saying –

|  ‘We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned.[11:18] The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’

[11:19] Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail.

 [Revelation 12] 

##### Vision of Seven Figures #####

[12:1] Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.[12:2] She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.[12:3] Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.[12:4] His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.[12:5] The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.[12:6] But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days.

[12:7] Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,[12:8] he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.[12:9] Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.[12:10] And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said –

|  ‘Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and night.[12:11] Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.[12:12] Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’

[12:13] When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.[12:14] But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.[12:15] Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.[12:16] But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.[12:17] The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;[12:18] and he took his stand on the sea-shore.

 [Revelation 13] 

[13:1] Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.[13:2] The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.[13:3] One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;[13:4] and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – ‘Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?’[13:5] The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.[13:6] It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.[13:7] It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.[13:8] All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.[13:9] Let those who have ears hear.[13:10] Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.)

[13:11] Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.[13:12] It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.[13:13] It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;[13:14] and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honor of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.[13:15] It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.[13:16] High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,[13:17] so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.[13:18] (Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.

 [Revelation 14] 


[14:1] Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.[14:2] And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.[14:3] They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.[14:4] These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.[14:5] No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.

[14:6] Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;[14:7] and he cried in a loud voice – ‘Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.’

[14:8] Then a second angel followed, crying – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!’

[14:9] Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – ‘Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,[14:10] that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulfur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.[14:11] The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’[14:12] (Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)[14:13] Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.”’

“Yes,” answers the Spirit, “that they may rest from their toil. Their good deeds go with them.”

[14:14] Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

[14:15] Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – ‘Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.’[14:16] He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped.

[14:17] Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle.

[14:18] Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – ‘Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.’[14:19] The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.[14:20] The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.

 [Revelation 15] 

##### Vision of Seven Curses #####

[15:1] Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvelous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.

[15:2] Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.[15:3] They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb –

|  ‘Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King.[15:4] Who will not honor and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.’

[15:5] After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,[15:6] and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.[15:7] One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.[15:8] The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.

 [Revelation 16] 

[16:1] Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’

[16:2] The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.

[16:3] Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea.

[16:4] Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.[16:5] And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;[16:6] for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’[16:7] And I heard the response from the altar – ‘Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.’

[16:8] Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;[16:9] and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.

[16:10] Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,[16:11] and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.

[16:12] Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.[16:13] And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.[16:14] They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.[16:15]  (‘I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.’) [16:16] And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew ‘Har-Magedon.’

[16:17] Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said ‘All is over.’)[16:18] There followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth – none so great;[16:19] and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;[16:20] and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.[16:21] Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.

 [Revelation 17] 

##### Doom of the Enemies of Christ #####

[17:1] Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the sentence passed on that Great Harlot who is seated at the meeting of many waters,[17:2] and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.’[17:3] And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.[17:4] The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;[17:5] while on her forehead there was written this mystic name – ‘BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ALL IDOLATROUS ABOMINATIONS ON EARTH.’[17:6] And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;[17:7] but the angel said to me – ‘Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.[17:8] The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.’[17:9] (Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.[17:10] They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.[17:11] So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.[17:12] The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.[17:13] These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.[17:14] They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.[17:15] And the angel said to me – ‘The waters that you saw, where the Harlot is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.[17:16] The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast – they will hate the Harlot, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.[17:17] For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their kingdoms to the Beast, until God’s decrees will be executed.[17:18] As for the woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the kings of the earth.’

 [Revelation 18] 

[18:1] After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.[18:2] With a mighty voice he cried – “She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.[18:3] For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.”[18:4] Then I heard another voice from heaven saying – “Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.[18:5] For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.[18:6] Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;[18:7] for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’[18:8] Therefore in one day will these curses strike her – death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.”[18:9] All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,[18:10] while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry – “Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour your judgment fell.”[18:11] And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes –[18:12] their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;[18:13] nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.[18:14] The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.[18:15] The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying –[18:16] “Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments, and precious stones, and pearls![18:17] In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.” Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,[18:18] and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried – “What city can compare with the Great city?”[18:19] They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – “Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.”[18:20] Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her![18:21] Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying – “So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.[18:22] No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;[18:23] no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.”[18:24] Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.

 [Revelation 19] 


[19:1] After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying –

|  ‘Hallelujah! To our God belong salvation, and glory, and Power,[19:2] for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’

[19:3] Again they cried – ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.[19:4] Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;[19:5] and from the throne there came a voice which said –

|  ‘Praise our God all you who serve him, You who worship him, both high and low.’

[19:6] Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying –

|  ‘Hallelujah! For the Lord is king, our God, the Almighty.[19:7] Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honor, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.[19:8] And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.’

[19:9] Then a voice said to me ‘Write – “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said – ‘These words of God are true.’[19:10] I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’[19:11] Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.[19:12] His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;[19:13] he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’[19:14] The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.[19:15] From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;[19:16] and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’

[19:17] Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,[19:18] to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’[19:19] Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.[19:20] The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulfur.[19:21] The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.

 [Revelation 20] 


[20:1] Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.[20:2] He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.[20:3] He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.

[20:4] Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.[20:5] (The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.[20:6] Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.

[20:7] When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his prison,[20:8] and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.[20:9] They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;[20:10] and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.

[20:11] Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.[20:12] And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.[20:13] The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.[20:14] Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;[20:15] and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.

 [Revelation 21] 

##### The New Creation #####

[21:1] Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.[21:2] And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.[21:3] And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,[21:4] and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’[21:5] And he who was seated on the throne said – ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said – ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’[21:6] And he said to me – ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.[21:7] Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.[21:8] But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars – their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulfur. That is the Second Death.’

[21:9] Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’[21:10] He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.[21:11] Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.[21:12] It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.[21:13] There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.[21:14] The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.[21:15] And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.[21:16] The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.[21:17] Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.[21:18] The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.[21:19] The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;[21:20] the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.[21:21] The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.[21:22] And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.[21:23] The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb.[21:24] The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.[21:25] Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there.[21:26] And people will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.[21:27] Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life.

 [Revelation 22] 

[22:1] And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,[22:2] in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.[22:3] Every thing that is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;[22:4] they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.[22:5] Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.

##### Conclusion #####

[22:6] Then the angel said to me – “These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;[22:7] and they said  ‘I will come quickly.’  Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.”

[22:8] It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.[22:9] But he said to me – “Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.”

[22:10] Then the angel said to me – “Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near.[22:11] Let the wrong-doer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to be holy.”[22:12]  (‘I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to each what their actions deserve. [22:13]  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the End.’) [22:14] Blessed will they be who wash their robes! They will have the right to approach the Tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.[22:15] Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.

[22:16]  ‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these things before the churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David, the bright star of the Morning.’ 

[22:17] ‘Come,’ say the Spirit and the Bride; and all who hear, say ‘Come.’ All who thirst, come; anyone who wants, take the water of life freely.

[22:18] I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in this book – ‘If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the curses described in this book;[22:19] and if anyone takes away any of the words in the book containing this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of life, and in the Holy City – as described in this book.’

[22:20] He whose testimony this is says –  ‘Assuredly I will come quickly.’  ‘Amen, come, Lord Jesus.’

[22:21] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with his people.% Open English Bible
