<h1>Open English Bible</h1>

<h2>NT, Psalms</h2>

<h2>and selected Old Testament books</h2>

<h1>Publication Data</h1>

<p> This is a development version of the Open English Bible, after release 2016.1. 

<p> This version uses US spelling (for example, “color”). 

<h1>Preface</h1>

<h5>The Open English Bible</h5>

<p> The Open English Bible project aims to create a modern English translation of the Bible which is completely free of copyright restrictions and available without cost for any purpose. 

<p> The OEB is your Bible — you can use it in worship, print as many copies as you want (in whole or part), republish it on your own website, even remix it or take it as the base for your own translation to meet your needs and the needs of your community. And you can do this without needing our permission or paying us a cent (or penny, rupee or kobo). 

<h5>Base texts</h5>

<p> The normative text for the OEB New Testament is the Westcott & Hort critical text. Since the NA28 is subject to a claim of copyright, W&H remains the best available public domain text. 

<p> The normative text for the OEB Old Testament is the Codex Leningradensis (Leningrad Codex); specifically the electronic version of the Westminster Leningrad Codex.  

<p> The OEB is being created by taking existing English language translations which are in the public domain, and conforming them to modern English and suitable public domain Greek and Hebrew source texts.  p The New Testament of the OEB is being formed on the base of the “Twentieth Century New Testament”, in particular the revised edition published in 1904. The Old Testament books which have been completed at this stage lean heavily on the work of John Edgar McFadyen and Charles Foster Kent, both of whom were very respected turn of the century Old Testament scholars.  p The TCNT was one of the earliest 20th century attempts at a translation in clear modern language aimed at the ordinary reader and based on a modern textual base (ie Westcott & Hort). Predating the mid-20th century translations such as the New English Bible and even Moffatt’s groundbreaking attempt, it is out of copyright worldwide. The TCNT also has a particular resonance with the open source and free content communities of today - it was created by a loose collaboration of volunteers rather than a top-down hierarchy. Given the requirements of modern language and public domain status the TCNT was the best contender. 

<h5>Copyright</h5>

<p> The OEB is available under a CC0 licence, effectively a waiver of copyright which allows the maximum reuse. We request (though this is not a licence condition) that altered versions be distributed under another name, or with changes clearly and comprehensively disclosed so that readers are not confused.

<h1>Genesis</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 1]</p>

<h5>Creation</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the earth was still unformed and chaotic, 

<p class="indent-2"> with darkness on the surface of the abyss, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the spirit of God hovering over the waters. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  God saw that the light was good. 

<p class="indent-2"> He separated the light from the darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  calling the light ’day’ and the darkness ’night’. 

<p class="indent-1"> There was an evening and a morning, making the first day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then God said, “Let there be a dome between the waters, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let it separate the waters from the waters.” 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So God made the dome to separate the waters below 

<p class="indent-2"> from the waters which were above it. 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  God called the dome the ’sky’. 

<p class="indent-1"> There was an evening and a morning, making the second day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let the dry ground appear.” 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  God called the dry ground ’land’ 

<p class="indent-2"> and he called the gathered waters ’seas’. 

<p class="indent-3"> God saw that it was good. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: 

<p class="indent-2"> Plants on the earth which yield their own kind of seed, 

<p class="indent-2"> and trees that bear fruits in which are their own seed.” 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The earth sprouted vegetation: 

<p class="indent-2"> seed-bearing plants, 

<p class="indent-2"> and trees with seed-bearing fruit. 

<p class="indent-3"> God saw that it was good. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There was an evening and a morning, making the third day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky 

<p class="indent-2"> to separate the night from the day. 

<p class="indent-2"> Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the years. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Let them be lights in the dome of the sky to light the earth.” 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So God made the two great lights: 

<p class="indent-2"> The greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> God made the stars also.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He placed all these lights in the dome of the sky 

<p class="indent-2"> to shed light upon the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  to rule over the day and over the night, 

<p class="indent-2"> and to separate light from darkness. 

<p class="indent-3"> God saw that it was good. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  There was an evening and a morning, making the fourth day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let birds fly over the earth in the open dome of the sky.” 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  God created the great sea monsters, 

<p class="indent-2"> all kinds of living, moving creatures with which the waters teem, 

<p class="indent-2"> and all kinds of winged birds. 

<p class="indent-3"> God saw that it was good. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, 

<p class="indent-2"> increase, fill the oceans, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let the birds increase on the land.” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  There was an evening and a morning, making the fifth day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then God said, “Let the earth produce all kinds of living creatures: 

<p class="indent-2"> cattle and reptiles and wild beasts.” 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So God made all the different kinds of wild beasts, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the cattle, and everything that crawls upon the ground. 

<p class="indent-3"> God saw that it was good. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then God said, “Let us make humans who are images of us, who are like us. 

<p class="indent-2"> Let them rule over the fish of the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts, 

<p class="indent-2"> and all the reptiles that crawl upon the ground.” 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So God created humans in his image, 

<p class="indent-3"> he created them in the image of God. 

<p class="indent-2"> He created them male and female. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then God blessed them, and said to them: 

<p class="indent-2"> “Be fruitful, grow in number, 

<p class="indent-2"> fill the earth and govern it; 

<p class="indent-2"> rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, 

<p class="indent-2"> and over every living thing that crawls on the ground,” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant 

<p class="indent-2"> throughout all the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit. 

<p class="indent-2"> They will be food for you, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  and to every wild beast and to every bird of the sky, 

<p class="indent-2"> and to everything that crawls on the earth - 

<p class="indent-2"> everything with the breath of life in it, 

<p class="indent-2"> I give every green plant for food.” 

<p class="indent-3"> It was so. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When God saw all that he had made, 

<p class="indent-2"> he perceived that it was very good. 

<p class="indent-1"> There was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 2]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So the heavens and the earth were finished, and everything in them. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When on the seventh day God finished the work which he had done, 

<p class="indent-2"> he rested that day from all his work. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  God blessed the seventh day and set it apart, 

<p class="indent-2"> for in it he rested from all the creative work which he had done. 

<h5>The garden</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  This is the story of the heavens and earth when they were created. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> At the time when the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God made earth and heaven,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  there were not yet any plants on the earth, and no vegetation had sprung up; for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the soil.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  A mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God molded a human being out of dust taken from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living being.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and placed the human he had formed there.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  From the soil the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God made grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food, with the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A river flowed out of Eden and watered the garden, and from there branched into four.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The name of the first is Pishon, which flows round the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The gold of that land is pure and there is aromatic gum and the onyx stone.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows around the whole land of Cush,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and the name of the third river is the Tigris, which heads toward the east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God took the human and placed him in the garden of Eden to till it and to care for it.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God also gave the human this command: “You may freely eat from every tree of the garden,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  except from the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you must not eat, for on the day that you eat from it you will surely die.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God said, “It is not good for the human to be alone; I will make a helper suited to him.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So out of the ground the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God formed all the wild beasts and birds, and made them come to the human to see what he would call them. Whatever he called each living creature, that was its name.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So the human, Adam gave names to all cattle and all the wild birds and beasts. But there was no companion suitable for him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God caused the human to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  With the rib which he had taken from the human, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  built up a woman and brought her to the human.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then the human said, “This now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, for from man she was taken.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and the two become one flesh. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  The man and his wife were both naked, yet felt no shame. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now the snake was craftier than any other wild beast that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God had made. It said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the garden’?”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The woman answered, “We are allowed to eat the fruit of all the trees of the garden;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God has said, ‘You must not eat from it, nor should you touch it, for if you do, you will die.’”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then the snake said to the woman, “You will not die!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  God knows that on the day you eat some of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing what is good and what is evil.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, attractive to look at and desirable for acquiring wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked, so they sewed fig-leaves together to cover themselves.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But when they heard the sound of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God walking in the garden in the evening breeze, the man and his wife hid from him among the garden trees. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God called to the man, “Where are you?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  he replied, “I heard you in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree from which I ordered you not to eat?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The man answered, “The woman you placed beside me, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman replied, “The snake deceived me, and I ate.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God said to the snake: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Because you have done this, 

<p class="indent-1"> you will be more accursed than all cattle 

<p class="indent-1"> and all the wild beasts. 

<p class="indent-1"> You will crawl on your belly 

<p class="indent-1"> and eat dust 

<p class="indent-1"> all your life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I will establish hostility between you and the woman, 

<p class="indent-1"> between your offspring and hers, 

<p class="indent-1"> who will wound your head, 

<p class="indent-1"> and you will wound their heel.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To the woman he said, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “I will greatly increase your anguished toil in pregnancy; 

<p class="indent-1"> with pain will you bear children. 

<p class="indent-1">

<p class="indent-1"> You will yearn for your husband, 

<p class="indent-1"> but he will rule over you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To Adam he said, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, 

<p class="indent-1"> and ate from the tree 

<p class="indent-1"> about which I ordered you: 

<p class="indent-1"> ’You must never eat from it’ 

<p class="indent-1"> the ground will be cursed because of you; 

<p class="indent-1"> as long as you live, you will earn a living only by anguished toil. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The ground will always bring forth thorns and thistles, 

<p class="indent-1"> and you will eat the plants of the field. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread, 

<p class="indent-1"> until you return to the ground, 

<p class="indent-1"> for from it you were taken; 

<p class="indent-1"> for dust you are, 

<p class="indent-1"> and to dust you will return!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The man, Adam, named his wife Eve [Note:   Heb Havvah, that is, Life.  ] ; because she was the mother of all living people.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God made clothes from animal skins for Adam and his wife and dressed them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God said: “The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not reach out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God sent him out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He drove out Adam and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the blazing whirling sword, to bar the way to the tree of life.           

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 4]</p>

<h5>Cain and Abel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Adam lay with his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have created a man with the help of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> !”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  She also gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, while Cain was a farmer. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In the course of time Cain brought some of the ground’s produce as an offering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Abel too brought some of the choicest animals of his flock and sacrificed their fat pieces. The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  looked with approval on Abel and his offering  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  but he could not receive Cain and his offering with approval. 

<p> Cain burned with anger and his face fell.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Cain, “Why are you angry and why do you scowl?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If you do what is right and good, can’t you hold your head up high? But if you do wrong, sin crouches at the door and longs to have you, but you must master it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go into the field.” While they were there, Cain attacked his brother and killed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  asked Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He answered, “I do not know! Am I my brother’s keeper?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “What have you done?” the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  replied, “Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Even now you are cursed by the very ground that has opened to receive your brother’s blood shed by your hand.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  From now on when you till the ground, it will no longer yield its best to you. You will be a vagabond and a wandering refugee upon the earth.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Cain said to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , “My punishment is too much for me to bear.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Look! Today you banish me from the ground. I must hide in your presence. I will be a wandering refugee upon the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to him, “If any one kills you, the crime shall be avenged sevenfold.” So the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  placed a distinctive mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Cain departed from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s presence and lived east of Eden in the land of Wandering. 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Cain lay with his wife. She became pregnant, giving birth to Enoch. Cain built a city, and named it after his son Enoch.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 

<h5>Lamech’s vengence</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Lamech took two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the ancestor of the people who live in tents and have cattle.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of the people who play the harp and flute.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As for Zillah, she gave birth to Tubal-cain, who forged all sort of tools from copper and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Lamech said to his wives: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; 

<p class="indent-2"> wives of Lamech, listen to my speech; 

<p class="indent-1"> because I have slain a man for wounding me, 

<p class="indent-2"> and a young man for bruising me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  If Cain is to be avenged sevenfold, 

<p class="indent-2"> then Lamech will be seventy and sevenfold.” 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Adam lay with his wife again and she bore a son. She named him Seth: “because God gave me another son for Abel, who was killed by Cain.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Seth too had a son. He named him Enosh. That was when people began worshipping in the name of  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  This is the list of the descendants of Adam. On the day that God created human beings, he made them in his own image.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He created them male and female created, and blessed them, and called their name Adam. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Adam lived for a hundred and thirty years, and had a son in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Adam lived for eight hundred years after he had Seth; and he had sons and daughters.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  In total, Adam lived for nine hundred and thirty years; and then he died.

<h5>The divine beings and the beautiful daughters</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When people began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  some of the heavenly beings saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful; and they took them as wives, whoever they chose.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said: “My spirit shall not abide in people forever, because they are flesh; therefore they will live for only a hundred and twenty years.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days (and later too) when the heavenly beings lay with the human daughters who had their children. These were the mighty heroes of old, men of renown. 

<h5>The flood</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  saw that people’s wickedness was increasing in the world, and that the trend of their thoughts was at all times toward evil,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  he was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made people on the earth.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “I will destroy all living beings from off the ground — people, animals, creeping things, and birds — because I regret that I have made them.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But Noah had won the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s favor. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This is the story of Noah. Among the people of his time, Noah was righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  God saw that the earth was corrupt and full of violence.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  God looked at the earth and saw that it was corrupt; all living things on the earth had become corrupt in their ways. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So God said to Noah, “I have determined to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with their acts of injustice; I am going to destroy them from the earth.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Make yourself an ark of cypress wood. Construct rooms in the ark, and coat it within and without with pitch.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  This is how you shall build it: the length of the ark shall be five hundred feet, its breadth eighty feet, and its height fifty feet.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Make a roof for it and place the door on the side. Construct it with lower, second, and third storeys.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For I am about to bring floods of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven every living thing in which is the breath of life; every thing that is on the earth shall die. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  “But I will make a solemn agreement with you. Go into the ark with your sons, your wife and their wives,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and take with you into the ark two of every kind living thing, a male and a female,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  birds, animals and creeping things, so that they might be kept alive.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Take and store food for them and you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Noah did all this. He did everything that God told him to. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Noah, “Enter with all your household into the ark; for I see that in this age you are living before me an upright life.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Take seven of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are not fit for food and sacrifice take only two, the male and the female;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and of the wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice take seven, to keep the species alive on the earth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  After seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Noah did all that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  commanded him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He was six hundred years old, and when the waters of the flood came upon the earth  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  he, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  together with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Two by two, male and female, they entered the ark as God had commanded Noah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  After seven days, the flood waters came.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day, all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened — and  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  it rained for forty days and forty nights.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  That was the day that Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, and  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  every type of animal, and cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and bird  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  went with Noah into the ark, two by two of every kind of living thing.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They went in, male and female, as God had commanded Noah; and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  shut Noah in the ark. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The flood continued for forty days, and the waters increased and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  It floated on the surface as the waters rose higher over the land.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Higher the waters rose over the land — until the highest mountains were covered  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  by more than twenty feet. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  All creatures on the land, bird and cattle and animals, every creature that swarms on the ground, every person,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life, died.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and creeping things, and the birds of the heavens, and Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The waters did not start to go down for a hundred and fifty days. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood subsided,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the fountains of the deed were stopped and the windows of heaven closed, and the rain from heaven ceased,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and the waters withdrew more and more from the land for a hundred and fifty days.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The waters continued to go down until, on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains could be seen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and sent out a raven; and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the ground;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  but the dove found no rest for her foot, and so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the surface of the whole earth. So he reached out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The dove came in to him at dusk and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He waited seven days more and sent out the dove; but it did not return to him again. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So it was that in the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the waters had dried up. Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It was the twenty-seventh day of the second month. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  God said to Noah,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “Leave the ark with your wife and sons and their wives.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Bring out every living creature, every bird, cattle, and creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they can spread over the earth, and be fruitful and multiply.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So Noah left the ark with his sons and his wife and his son’s wives,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird came out one kind after another.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Noah built an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  smelled the pleasing odour, he said to himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of people because the inclination of their heart is evil from their youth, nor will I again destroy every living thing, as I have done.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Bear children and multiply and repopulate the earth.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Every wild beast and bird and everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea shall fear and dread you; into your hand they are given.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as I gave the green herbs, I give them all to you.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Only you shall not eat flesh while the life is in it, that is, the blood. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Moreover, your own life-blood will I require for a person’s life; from every beast will I require it, and from everyone who takes another’s life.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Whoever sheds a person’s blood, by people shall their blood be shed; for God made people in his own image.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But you are to bear children and repopulate the whole earth and subdue it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  God also said to Noah and to his sons with him,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Now I make this solemn agreement with you and with your descendants  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and with every living creature that is with you, with the birds, the cattle, and every wild animal that is with you of all that have gone out of the ark, even with every beast of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This is my solemn agreement: No living thing will ever again be cut off by the waters of the flood, and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  God said, “This is the symbol of the solemn agreement that I make for all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you:  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I have placed my bow in the cloud and it shall be the symbol of the solemn agreement between me and the inhabitants of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I will remember the agreement which is between me and you and every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all living things.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Whenever the bow is seen in the cloud, I will see it and remember the everlasting agreement between God and every living creature on earth,”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  God said to Noah, “it is the sign of the solemn agreement which I have made with everything that lives on earth.” 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The sons of Noah, who left the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The descendants of these three sons of Noah spread over the whole earth. 

<h5>Noah and the first vineyard</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now Noah, the farmer, was the first to plant a vineyard.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When he drank the wine he became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers about it.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward to cover the nakedness of their father, their faces being turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  he said, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Cursed be Canaan; 

<p class="indent-1"> may he be a slave of slaves to his brothers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Also he said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Blessed of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be Shem; 

<p class="indent-2"> and let Canaan be a slave to him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  God enlarge Japheth 

<p class="indent-2"> and let him live in the tents of Shem. 

<p class="indent-1"> Let Canaan be a slave to him as well. 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 10]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now these are the descendants of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and to them were sons born after the flood.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  From the descendants of these were the peoples of the coasts and islands divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be known as a mighty one in the earth.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He was a mighty hunter before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ; which is why people say: “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah — which is the great city.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Mizraim fathered Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and Pathrusim, and Casluhim — from whom went forth the Philistines — and Caphtorim.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Canaan fathered Zidon his firstborn, and Heth;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  To Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Joktan fathered Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba;  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Their settlements were from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, to the mountain of the east.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 11]</p>

<h5>Babel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  All the inhabitants of the earth had one language and vocabulary;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and as they travelled westward, they found a broad valley in the land of Shinar, and made their home there. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then they said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them.” So they had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will touch the heavens. We will make a landmark, so that we are not scattered over all the earth.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But when the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came down to see the city and tower that people had built,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  he said, “See, they are one people and all have one language. This is only the beginning of their activity, and now nothing that they propose to do will seem too difficult for them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Come, let us go down there and confuse their language, so that they do not understand each other’s speech.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  scattered them from there over all the earth; and they ceased building the city.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  That is why they named it Babel [Note:   Confusion  ] , for there the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  confused the language of all the inhabitants of earth and scattered them over the whole world. 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Shem lived for five hundred years after he fathered Arpachshad, and fathered sons and daughters. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Arpachshad lived for five and thirty years, and fathered Shelah.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Arpachshad lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Shelah, and fathered sons and daughters. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Shelah lived for thirty years, and fathered Eber.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Shelah lived for four hundred and three years after he fathered Eber, and fathered sons and daughters. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Eber lived for four and thirty years, and fathered Peleg.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Eber lived for four hundred and thirty years after he fathered Peleg, and fathered sons and daughters.

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Sarai was barren; she had no child.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they nt to Haran, and dwelt there.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  In total, Terah lived for two hundred and five years; and died in Haran. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 12]</p>

<h5>Abram’s Journey</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Abram, “Go from your country, your relatives and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I will make of you a great nation; and I will surely bless you and make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you, and all the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like your own.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Abram set out, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had commanded him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son and all the slaves that they had acquired in Haran, and started for the land of Canaan. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Abram passed through the land to a place called Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites lived there.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” There Abram built an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who had appeared to him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  From there he moved on to the hill at the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east, and there too he built an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and prayed to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Abram moved on, going from place to place toward the Nagreb.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there; because the famine was severe in the land.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “You are a beautiful woman;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘She is his wife’; and they will kill me, but let you live.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Say you are my sister, so that everything may go well for me because of you and my life will be spared.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  W hen Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Serai was very beautiful.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The officials of Pharaoh, when they saw her, praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh’s household.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, and oxen and donkeys, and male and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent great plagues to Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Here she is, take her and go.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Pharaoh gave his men orders to send him on his way with his wife and all his possessions. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So Abram and his wife and all his possessions left Egypt and went to the Negreb and Lot went with him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Abram was now very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He journeyed on from the Negreb in stages towards Bethel, to the place where he had earlier pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and had set up the alter to worship the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Lot, who went with Abram, also had so many flocks and herds and tents  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  that the land was not fertile enough to support them both. They had too many animals to live in the same place.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  At that time, the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land. So when there was a quarrel between Lot’s herdsmen and Abram’s herdsmen,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Abram said to Lot, “There should be no quarrels between me and you, or between my herdsmen and yours, because we are relatives.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Is not the whole land before you? Let’s separate. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan and went on to the east; and they separated from one another.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Abram lived in the land of Canaan and Lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  (But the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinned against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Abram, after Lot had gone away from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward and westward,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I will make your descendants as many as the dust of the earth, so that if someone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Rise, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 14]</p>

<h5>Victory over the Four Eastern Kings</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I n the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  they went to war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  All these joined forces together in the valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea). 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaonier, but in the thirteenth year they had rebelled.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So in the fourteenth year Chedorlaonier, and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, to El-Paran, which is on the edge of the wilderness.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then they returned and came to En-Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and laid waste all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-Tamar. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So the king of Sodom went out together with the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar); and they set themselves in battle array against them in the valley of Siddim;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now the valley of Siddim is full of bitumen pits; so when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but those who remained fled to the mountain.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions and went their way.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who was living in Sodom, and his goods and departed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were supporters of Abram.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then, dividing his band in order to attack the kings by night, he with his servants attacked them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So he brought back all the goods, and also his kinsman Lot, with his goods, as well as the women and the people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Vale).  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Melchizedek king of Salem also brought out bread and wine; and he was priest of God Most High.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He blessed him saying: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Blessed be Abram before God Most High, 

<p class="indent-2"> possessor of heaven and earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Blessed be God Most High, 

<p class="indent-2"> who has delivered your foes into your power. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me my people, and take the goods for yourself.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  that I would not take a thread nor a sandal-thong nor anything that is yours, so that you could not say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  By no means! Only that which the servants have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre — let them take their portion.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 15]</p>

<h5>Abram’s vision</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After these things God spoke to Abram in a vision saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield. Your reward will be exceedingly great.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But Abram said, “Lord  <span class="tetragrammaton"> God </span> , what can you give me? I am childless, and the person who will be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  to me you have given no offspring, and, so a slave born in my house is my heir.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to him, “This man will not be your heir, but a child of your own will be your heir.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then God brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them! So will your descendants be.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Abram believed in the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ; and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  reckoned it to him as righteousness,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and said to him, “I am the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give to you this land to inherit it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Abram said, “Lord  <span class="tetragrammaton"> God </span> , how will I know that I will inherit it?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to him, “Bring me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Abram brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds he did not divide.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a horror of great darkness fell on him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Abram, “Know certainly that your descendants will be foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there; and they will be held there for four hundred years.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But I will judge that nation, whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many goods.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But you will go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried in a good old age.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In the fourth generation they return here again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between the pieces of the animals. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  At that time the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  made a solemn agreement with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  (This includes the lands of the Kenite, the Kenizzite, the Kadmonite,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Rephaim,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Girgashite, and Jebusite). 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 16]</p>

<h5>Hagar and Ishmael</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Sarai said to Abram, “the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has denied me children; Take my slave-girl; maybe I will obtain children by her.” Then Abram listened to her  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  so she took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, after Abram had lived for ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and Abram lay with Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Sarai complained to Abram, “May the wrong I suffer be on you! I myself gave my slave-girl to you; and now that she sees that she has conceived, I am despised by her; may the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  judge between me and you.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But Abram said to Sarai, “Your maid-servant is in your power, do to her whatever seems right to you.” Then Sarai ill-treated her so that she fled from her presence. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring in the way to Shur.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave-girl, where have you come from? And where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of mistress Sarai.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit yourself to her authority.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Moreover the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to her, “I will make your descendants so many that they can not be numbered because they are so numerous.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  also said to her, “You are pregnant, and will have a son; you must call him Ishmael God hears, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has heard of your ill-treatment.” 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He shall be like a wild donkey, 

<p class="indent-2"> his hand against every man, 

<p class="indent-2"> and every man’s hand against him; 

<p class="indent-1"> and he will live at odds with all his relatives. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then she called the name of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , who had spoken to her, El-roi (You are a God who sees me); for she said, “Have I seen God and am I still alive after I have looked upon him?”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore the well is called Beer-lahai-roi [Note:   Well of the living One who sees me  ] , ( it is between Kadesh and Bered)  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Abram was eighty-six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  revealed himself to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty, walk before me and be blameless  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and I will make my solemn agreement between me and you and will make your descendants exceedingly numerous.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “I make this solemn promise to you: you will be the father of a multitude of nations.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Neither will your name any longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I will make you the father of a multitude of nations.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and will make nations of you, and kings shall spring from you.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I will establish my solemn agreement between me and you and your descendants after your throughout their generations, an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your descendants after you.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I will give to you, and to your descendants after your, the land where you are now foreigners, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.” 

<h5>Circumcision</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God also said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep the requirements of my solemn agreement, you, and your descendants after you throughout their generations.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  This is my solemn agreement, which you must keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you must be circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Whenever you are circumcised, the flesh of your foreskin shall be a sign of a solemn agreement between me and you.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Every male when he is eight days old, must be circumcised throughout your generations, whether he is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The slave who is born in your house and the one who is bought with your money must be circumcised. The sign of my solemn agreement will be in your flesh — an everlasting agreement.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As for the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that one will be cut off from his people; he has broken my solemn agreement.” 

<h5>Sarai becomes Sarah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her name Sarai, but Sarah.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I will bless her, and will give you a son from her: I will bless her, and she will become the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself. “Will a child be born to one who is an hundred years old? Will Sarah who is ninety years old bear children?”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live with your blessing!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But God said, “No. But Sarah your wife is about to bear your a son; call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  However I have heard you regarding Ishmael: I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and his descendants exceedingly many. Twelve princes he will father, and I will make him a great nation.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time next year.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When he had finished talking with him, God left Abraham. 

<h5>Abraham and Isaac’s circumcision</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very same day, as God had said to him.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  On this very same day was Abraham circumcised, with Ishmael his son.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  All the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from foreigners, were circumcised with him. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 18]</p>

<h5>The guests at the oaks of Mamre</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  also appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and, as he looked up, three men stood there before him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed to the ground  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and said, “Sirs, if you are willing to do me a favor, do not, I beg of you, pass by your servant.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Since you have come to your servant, let a little water be brought, so that you may wash your feet, and lie down under the tree.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And let me bring some food, so that you may refresh yourselves; afterward you may go on your way.” They replied, “Do as you have said.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Abraham hastened to Sarah’s tent and said, “Make ready quickly four measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a calf that was tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he prepared it quickly.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Abraham took curd and milk, with the calf that he had prepared, and served them; and he waited on them under the tree, while they ate. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then they said to him, “Where is your wife?” He said, “There, within the tent.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  One of them said, “I will surely return to you about nine months from now, and then, Sarah your wife shall have a son.”  But Sarah was listening behind the door of the tent.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Now Sarah and Abraham were advanced in years;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so she laughed to herself, saying, “After I and my husband are so old will I have pleasure?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I, indeed, even when I am old give birth to a child?’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Is anything too wonderful for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ? At the appointed time about nine months from now, I will return to you and Sarah shall have a son.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Sarah was frightened and denied that she had laughed, but he said “Yes, you laughed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then the men started from there and looked off in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went along with them to start them on their way.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “Should I conceal from Abraham that which I am about to do,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  since Abraham will become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will want a blessing like his for themselves?  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For I have chosen him in order that he may teach his sons and his household after him, and that they may keep the way of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , by doing righteousness and justice, so that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  may bring on Abraham that which he has promised concerning him.” 

<h5>Sodom and Gomorrah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “The complaint has come that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have committed great and terrible sins.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I will go down and see whether they have done exactly as the complaint comes to me; and if they have not, I will know.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, Abraham remained standing before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Abraham drew near to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and said, “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Suppose there are within the city fifty people who are righteous. Will you sweep it away and not forgive the place for sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Far be it from you to do this: to slay the righteous with the wicked! And that the righteous should be treated as the wicked, far be it from you! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “If I find in the city of Sodom fifty who are righteous, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Abraham answered, “I have dared to speak to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , even though I am but dust and ashes.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Suppose there be five lacking of the fifty righteous. Will you sweep away all the city for lack of five?” The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “I will not sweep it away, if I find forty-five there.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then Abraham spoke to him again, and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” He replied, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then Abraham said, “Oh, let not the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be angry, but let me speak. Suppose thirty are found there?” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then Abraham said, “You see that I have dared to speak to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Suppose twenty are found there?” He replied, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then Abraham said, “Oh, let not the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be angry, but let me speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there?” And he said, “For the sake of the ten I will not destroy it.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  went his way, and Abraham returned home. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 19]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Two messengers came to Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed with his face to the earth  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and said, “Sirs, turn aside, I beg of you, into your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No, we will spend the night in the street.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But he urged them so strongly that they went with him and entered his house. He made a feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They called out to Lot, “Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can rape them.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the door after him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He said, “I beg of you, my friends, do not do what is wrong.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  See, I have two unmarried daughters; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you desire; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But they replied, “Stand back!” And they added, “This one came in as a foreigner to live here, but now he would set himself up as a judge! We will treat you worse than them.” They pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the door.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and shut the door.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of searching for the door. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then the men said to Lot, “Have you any one else here? Bring your sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city out of this place,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  for we are about to destroy it, because great complaint concerning the people has come to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and he has sent us to destroy it.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, “Up, go out of this place, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will destroy the city.” But his sons-in-law thought he was only jesting. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When the dawn appeared, the messengers urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters so that you may not be swept away in the punishment of the city.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When he hesitated, the men grabbed him by the hand and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was merciful to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When they had brought them outside, they said, “Run for your life; do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the heights, that you may not be swept away!”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But Lot said to them, “Oh, sirs, not so!  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  See, your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  See now, this village is near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my life will be saved.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He answered, “I have also granted you this favor, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Make haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.” Therefore the village was called Zoar [Note:   Little  ] . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  caused brimstone and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and he destroyed those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and all that grew on the ground.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But Lot’s wife, who was following him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Early in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had stood before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a smelting-furnace.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  God had remembered Abraham when he destroyed the cities of the plain and rescued Lot from the destruction. 

<h5>Lot and his daughters</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  So they made their father drink wine that night; and the older daughter went in and lay with her father. He, however, did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then in the morning the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I lay with my father. Let us make him drink wine again tonight; and you go in and lie with him, so that we can preserve our family through our father.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  So they made their father drink wine that night as well. The younger arose and lay with him. He, however, did not know when she lay down nor when she arose.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  In this way both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Then Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and lived in a cave on the heights, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. His oldest daughter bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the present Moabites.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi. That one is the father of the present Ammonites. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 20]</p>

<h5>Abraham in Gerar</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negreb, settling between Kadesh and Shur, and staying for a while in Gerar,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  where he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him, “You will die, because of the woman you have taken, for she is married.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But Abimelech had not come near her; so he said, Lord, will you slay an innocent people?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Did Abraham not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister?’ And even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I acted innocently and in good faith.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then God said to him in the dream, “I know that you acted innocently and in good faith, and I also prevented you from sinning against me, since I did not allow you to touch her.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now you must restore the man’s wife — for he is a prophet and he can intercede for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore her at once, you will die, together with all your people.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Abimelech rose early in the morning, and summoned all his court, and when he had told all these things in their hearing, they were greatly afraid. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked him, “What have you done to us? What harm have I done to you to make you bring this great sin on me and my kingdom? You have done to me something that ought not to be done.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Abimelech said to Abraham, “What was your purpose in doing this thing?”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Abraham answered, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Moreover, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: at every place to which we come, say that you are my brother.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Abimelech then took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Also Abimelech said, “My land lies before you; live wherever you please.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To Sarah he said, “I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silveras compensation for all that has befallen you; and in every respect you are vindicated.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his slave-girls, so that they could have children (  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had made every woman in Abimelech’s household barren, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife). 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 21]</p>

<h5>Isaac</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  remembered what he had told Sarah, and he did as he had promised.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So Sarah had Abraham’s son in his old age at the fixed time of which God had told him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Abraham named him Isaac [Note:   Laughter  ] <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and when he was eight days old he circumcised him as God had told him to.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  She added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have born him a son in his old age.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When the child grew up, Abraham made a great feast on the day that he was weaned.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Sarah saw the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  S he said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave-girl and her son, for the son of this slave-girl shall not be heir with my son Isaac”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This request was very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased because of the boy and because of your slave-girl. Listen to all that Sarah says to you, for only through the line of Isaac will your name be perpetuated.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But I will also make of the son of the slave-girl a great nation, because he is your son.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, and he put the boy upon her shoulder and sent her away. So she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under one of the desert shrubs  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and went a short distance away and sat down and said, “Let me not see the death of the child.” So she sat there and wept. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  heard the cry of the boy, and the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  called to Hagar from heaven and said, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has heard the boy’s cry.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Rise, lift him up, and hold him fast by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. Then she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with the boy, and he grew up,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and lived in the wilderness of Paran, and became a bowman. His mother secured a wife for him from Egypt. 

<h5>The pact with Abimelech</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  It happened at that time that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all you do.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Now therefore take an oath to me here by God that you will not be false to me, nor to my son nor to my descendants; but that you will treat me and the land you have stayed in according to the kindness which I have shown you.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Abraham said, “I swear it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now as often as Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing, neither have you told me nor have I heard of it until today.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and made an agreement with each other.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But when Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Abraham answered, “Accept these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that you may be my witness that I dug this well.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The place was called Beer-sheba, because it was there they swore their oath.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So they made a solemn agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech arose with Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Abraham, however, planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the Everlasting God.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 22]</p>

<h5>The test of Abraham</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Later the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  tested Abraham, saying to him, “Abraham”; and he answered, “Here I am.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will show you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. When he had split the wood for the burnt-offering, he set out for the place of which God had told him.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  On the third day, when Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  he said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while I and the boy go over there. When we have worshipped, we will come back to you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac, his son. He took the fire and the knife, and they both went on together.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” and Abraham answered, “Yes, my son.” Isaac said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Abraham answered, “My son, God will himself provide a lamb for a burnt-offering.” So the two went on together. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood on it and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Abraham reached out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  called to him from heaven, saying, “Abraham, Abraham!” and he answered, “Here am I.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He said, “Do not put your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him, for now I know that you love God, for you have not refused to give your son, your only son, to me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Abraham looked up, and he saw a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So Abraham took the ram and offered him up as a burnt-offering instead of his son.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He named the place “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will provide” — and even today people say, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will provide on his mountain.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  again called to Abraham and said, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  declares, ‘Because you have done this thing and have not kept back your son, your only son,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I will surely bless you. I will make your children as many as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore, so that they will conquer their enemies.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  All the nations of the earth will ask for themselves a blessing like theirs, because you have obeyed my command.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Abraham returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba. 

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> Abraham was living in Beer-sheba.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  After these things, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Uz his first born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Chesed, Hazo and Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  (And Bethuel fathered Rebekah). These eight Mileah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And his concubine whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maaeah. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 23]</p>

<h5>Sarah’s death and the cave of Machpelah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When she died in Kiriath-arba (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan, Abraham went to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When Abraham rose up from the presence of his dead, he said to the Hittites,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “I am a stranger and a foreigner living among you; give me possession of a burying-place with you, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The Hittites answered Abraham,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the best of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, so that you may bury your dead.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Abraham rose up and bowed before the people of the land, the Hittites,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and said to them, “If it is your intention that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and speak for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  to give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give to me for the full price in your presence, so that I can own it as a burying-place.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites, and, in the presence of all the Hittites, all who went in and out at the gate of his city he answered Abraham,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “No, my lord, hear me. I give the field to you and the cave that is in it I give to you; in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “Please, hear me — I will give the price of the field; accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Ephron answered Abraham by saying to him,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, on the standard weights used by merchants. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah which was to the east of Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, with all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  were transferred to Abraham’s possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  After this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  In this way the field and the cave that is in it were transferred by the Hittites to Abraham that he might possess a burying-place. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 24]</p>

<h5>Rebekah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Abraham was very old and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had blessed him in every way,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Abraham said to the eldest of his household servants, who had charge of all his affairs, “Put your hand under my thigh,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  while I make you promise by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of heaven and earth, that you will not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  but that you will go to my own country and to my relatives and there get a wife for my son Isaac.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from my native land and who solemnly promised me, ‘To your children I will give this land,’ will send his messenger before you and there you will get a wife for my son.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But if the woman is not willing to come with you, then you will be free from this promise to me; only never take my son back there.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So the servant put his hand under Abraham’s thigh and made the promise. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and set out with precious gifts from his master. So he went to the town of Aram-naharaim, where Nahor lived.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He made the camels kneel down outside the town by the well in the evening, at the time when women go out to draw water.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then he said, “ <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of my master Abraham, give me, I pray, success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Here I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw water.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  May that young woman to whom I shall say, ‘Please let down your water-jar that I may drink’; and who answers, ‘Drink and I will also water your camels,’ may she be the one you have chosen for thy servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown kindness to my master.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then even before he was through speaking, Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water-jar upon her shoulder.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  She was very beautiful and unmarried, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  She answered, “Drink, sir,” and quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder upon her hand and gave him a drink. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When she had finished giving him a drink she said, “I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Meanwhile the man was silently gazing at her in order to find out whether the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had made his journey successful or not. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As soon as the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring, half a shekel in weight, and put it in her nose, and put on her arms two golden bracelets weighing ten shekels,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and said, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I beg of you. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  She answered, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of of Milcah and Nahor.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  We have plenty of straw and feed, and there is a place for you to spend the night.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then the man bowed his head and worshipped the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  saying, “Blessed be the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of my master Abraham, who has continued to show his mercy and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then the young woman ran and told these things to her mother’s family.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  When he saw the bracelets on his sister’s hands and the ring, and when he heard Rebekah say, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man, who was still standing by the camels at the spring,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and said, “Come in, you who are blessed by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ! Why do you stand outside? For I have cleared the house and have room for the camels.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So he brought the man into the house and took the packs off the camels and furnished straw and feed for them, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But when food was set before him to eat, he said, “I will not eat until I have made known my errand.” They answered, “Speak.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  He said, “I am Abraham’s servant;  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has blessed my master greatly, so that he has become very rich. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants, and camels and donkeys.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Now Sarah, my master’s wife, had a son when she was old, and my master has given him all that he has.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  My master also made me promise, saying, ‘Do not let my son marry one of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  but go to my father’s home and to my relatives and there find a wife for my son.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “When I said to my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  he said to me, ‘The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , whom I love and serve, will send his messenger with you and make you successful, and you will find for my son a wife from among my relatives and my father’s family.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Then you will be free from your promise to me. But if you go to my family and they do not give her to you, you shall also be free from your promise to me.’  <span class="v-num">[42-43]</span>  So I came today to the spring and said, ‘ <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of my master Abraham, see, I am standing by the spring of water. If you will make the errand on which I am going successful, then let the young woman who comes to draw, to whom I say, ‘Please give me a little water from your jar to drink’,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  and who shall say to me, ‘Drink, and I will also draw for your camels’, let that one be the woman whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has chosen for my master’s son.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  “Even before I was through speaking, Rebekah came out with her water-jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. When I said to her, ‘Please let me drink,’  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  she quickly let down her water-jar from her shoulder and answered, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  I bowed my head and worshipped and blessed the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  God of my master Abraham who had led me on the right way to find the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Tell me whether or not you will deal kindly and truly with my master, so that I shall know what to do!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  Then Laban and his family answered, “The matter is in the hands of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . We cannot say either ‘yes’ or ‘no.’  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  See, Rebekah is before you; take her and go and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has said.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  Then he brought out gold and silver ornaments and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. 

<p> When they rose in the morning, the servant said, “Send me away to my master.”  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  But Rebekah’s brother and mother answered, “Let the young woman stay with us a month or at least ten days; after that she may go.”  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  But he said to them, “Do not delay me, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has given me success. Send me away that I may go to my master.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  Then they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her.”  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  So they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She answered, “I will go.”  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  They also blessed Rebekah, saying to her, “Our sister! May your children and their children become thousands and thousands, may your sons conquer the cities of their enemies!”  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  Then Rebekah set out with her maids and, riding upon the camels, they followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.  <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  In the evening, when Isaac had gone out for a walk in the field, he looked up and saw camels coming.  <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  Rebekah too looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she quickly alighted from the camel  <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  and said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?” When the servant said, “It is my master,” she took her veil and covered her face.  <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done.  <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of Sarah his mother, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 25]</p>

<h5>Geneaology, Abraham’s death</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  She gave him sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jokshan fathered Sheba, and Dedan. T he sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Abraham had left all that he had to Isaac.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham had given gifts while he was still alive, and had sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Abraham had lived for one hundred and seventy-five years,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  when he breathed his last, dying in a good old age, old and satisfied with living, and was gathered to his forefathers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, who settled at Beer-lahai-roi. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  This is a list of descedents of Ishmael, Abraham’s son whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid-servant gave to Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  These then are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named according to their order of birth: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their peoples. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Ishmael lived for one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  They settled from Havilah to Shur that is  east of Egypt, as far as Assyria; he settled down alongside all his people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham fathered Isaac.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Isaac was forty years old, when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 

<h5>Esau and Jacob</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Isaac prayed to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  for his wife, because she had no children; and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  heard his prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant with twins.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The children struggled against each other in her womb, and she said, “Why is this happening to me? What does it mean?” She went to ask the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  who said to her, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Two nations are in your womb, 

<p class="indent-2"> two peoples divided from birth, 

<p class="indent-1"> One will be stronger than the other, 

<p class="indent-2"> the elder will serve the younger.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When the time came for her to give birth, she became the mother of twin boys.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  The first was from birth red, all over like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau [Note:   Hairy  ] .  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Afterwards his brother came holding Esau’s heel with his hand; so he was named Jacob [Note:   Supplanter  ] . Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As they grew up, Esau became a skilful hunter, a man who lived out in the fields; but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed about the tents.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Isaac loved Esau, for he had a taste for venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Once when Jacob was preparing a stew, Esau came in from the fields, and he was very hungry;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  so he said to Jacob, “Let me swallow some of that red stew, for I am very hungry.” (This is why he was called Edom.)  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But Jacob said, “Sell me first of all your right as the eldest.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Esau replied, “See, I am nearly dead now! So of what use is this birthright to me?”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Jacob said, “First solemnly promise to give it to me.” So Esau solemnly promised and sold his birthright to Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils, and when he had finished eating and drinking, he got up and went away. In this way Esau gave away his birthright. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 26]</p>

<h5>Famine again</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now when a famine came in the land, (not the first famine that was in the days of Abraham), Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  appeared to him and said, “Go not down into Egypt; settle in the land of which I will tell you,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  stay in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you, and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, and will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father:  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I will make your descendants as many as the stars of heaven, and give to your descendants all these lands; and all the nations of the earth will invoke for themselves a blessing like that of your descendants,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Isaac settled in Gerar. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, “She is my sister”; for he was afraid to say “my wife”; lest the men of the place kill him for Rebekah; because she was beautiful to look at.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But after he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of the window, and saw Isaac just as he was caressing Rebekah his wife. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Abimelech called to Isaac, and said, “Surely she is your wife; why did you say ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac answered him, “I said it, so that I might not die because of her.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife and so you would have brought guilt upon us.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “The person who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year an increase of a hundredfold, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  blessed him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The man became rich, and grew richer and richer until he became very wealthy; for he had many flocks, and many herds, and a great household; so that the Philistines envied him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now all the wells which Isaac’s father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father — for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he gave them the same names as his father had given them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go from us; for you are much mightier than we are.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So Isaac departed, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Isaac reopened the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and stopped by the Philistines after his death. He called them by the names his father had given them.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When Isaac’s slaves dug in the valley, they found there a well of spring water.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek [Note:   Contention  ] , because they contended with him.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And when they dug another well, they quarreled over that also. So he called the name of it Sitnah [Note:   Enmity  ] .  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He moved on from these and dug another well; and over that one there was no dispute. So he called it Rehoboth [Note:   Room  ] , and said, “For now the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Isaac went up from there to Beer-sheba.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father, do not be afraid, because I am with you, and will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Isaac built an altar there, and called upon the name of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and pitched his tent there. There also Isaac’s slaves dug a well. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hated me and have driven me away from you?”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  They said, “We saw plainly that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with you, so we said, ‘Let there now be a sworn treaty between us — let us make a solemn agreement with you —  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  so that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now blessed of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And he made them a feast and they ate and drank.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then in the morning they arose early and took oaths with each other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  That same day, Isaac’s slaves came and told him about a well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  He called it Shebna [Note:   Oath  ] , therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day. 

<h5>Esau and Jacob</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  and they were a source of grief to Isaac and to Rebekah. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 27]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Isaac was so old and so nearly blind that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son and said to him, “My son.” Esau answered, “Here I am.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Isaac said, “See, I am old and do not know how soon I may die.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  T ake your quiver and your bow and go out into the fields and hunt venison for me  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat and that I may bless you before I die.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went into the fields to hunt venison,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I just now heard your father say to your brother Esau,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  ‘Bring me venison and prepare for me savory food that I may eat it and bless you before I die.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now, my son, do as I tell you:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Go to the flock and bring me from there two good young goats, and I will make of them savory food for your father, such as he loves.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then take it to him, so that he may eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am smooth.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Perhaps my father will touch me; then I will appear to him to be a deceiver, and I will bring blame upon me and not a blessing.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But his mother said to him, “Let the curse be on me, my son; only obey me and go, bring the goats to me.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So he went and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food such as his father loved. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Rebekah also took the fine clothes of her older son Esau, which she had with her in the tent, and put them on her younger son Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then she put the skins of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and she placed the savory food and the bread which she had prepared in his hand,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and he went to his father and said, “My father.” Isaac answered, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jacob said, “I am Esau your oldest son. I have done as you commanded me. Sit up and eat some of my venison, so that you may bless me.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Isaac said to his son, “How very quickly you have found it, my son.” He answered, “Yes, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God gave me success.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come here, my son, that I may touch you to find out whether you are really my son Esau or not.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.  <span class="v-num">[23-24]</span>  Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob answered, “I am.” Isaac did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s. So he blessed him.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Isaac said, “Bring the food to me, that I may eat some of my son’s venison and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate. Jacob also brought him wine, and he drank. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As he came near and kissed him, he smelled the smell of his garment, and blessed him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> See, the smell of my son 

<p class="indent-2"> is as that of fields blessed by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  May God give you dew from heaven, 

<p class="indent-2"> a share in the earth’s fertile places, 

<p class="indent-2"> and plenty of corn and wine. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  May peoples be subject to you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and nations bow down to you. 

<p class="indent-1"> Be master over your brothers. 

<p class="indent-2"> Let your mother’s sons bow down before you, 

<p class="indent-1"> Cursed be all who curse you. 

<p class="indent-2"> and blessed be all who bless you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  As soon as Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and Jacob was about to leave his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  He also had made savory food and was bringing it to his father. So he said to him, “Father, rise and eat of your son’s venison, that you may bless me.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  But Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your oldest, Esau.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then Isaac trembled and said, “Who then is he that has hunted venison and brought it to me, so that I ate plentifully before you came, and blessed him? His blessing cannot be undone!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Father, bless me also!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  But Isaac said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Esau said, “He was correctly named Jacob [Note:   means Supplanter  ] . He has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Have you kept a blessing for me?”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him your master and I have given to him all his relatives as slaves and grain and wine as his food. What then can I do for you, my son?”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Esau said to his father, “Is that the only blessing you have, my father? Father, bless me too!” and Esau began to weep aloud.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Then Isaac his father answered him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “You shall live far from earth’s fertile places, 

<p class="indent-2"> and away from the dew of heaven. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  By your sword you will live, 

<p class="indent-2"> and your brother you will serve. 

<p class="indent-1"> But whenever you will break loose, 

<p class="indent-2"> you will break off his yoke from your neck.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him. Esau said to himself, “My father will soon die; then I will kill Jacob, my brother.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  When the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother, Esau, is going to kill you.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Now, my son, listen to me: run away to my brother Laban at Haran  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  and stay with him for a time until your brother is no longer angry  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  — until he is no longer angry and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” 

<h5>Wives for Jacob and Esau</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with life because of the Hittite women; if Jacob marries a Hittite woman, such as these, the women of the land, I might as well die.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 28]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and instructed him, “You must not marry any of the daughters of Canaan.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful and numerous, so that you may become a great people,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and may he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you so that you may inherit the land you have settled in, which God gave to Abraham.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau’s mother.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and send him away to Paddan-aram, to find a wife there, and that, as he blessed him, he instructed him: “You must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan”,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-aram,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and when Esau also saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  then Esau went to Ishmael, and in addition to the wives that he had, married Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth. 

<h5>Jacob and the ladder</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Jacob set out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When he arrived at a certain holy place, he passed the night there, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from its place and put it under his head and lay down to sleep.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then he dreamed and saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and the messengers of God were going up and down on it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  also stood beside him and said, “I am the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of Abraham and God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your children.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Your descendants will be as countless as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and all the families of the earth will wish for a blessing like yours and that of your descendants.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  See, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, “Surely the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is in this place, and I did not know it.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And he was filled with awe and said, “This place is the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He named that place Bethel [Note:   which means House of God  ] . (The earlier name of the town was Luz.)  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Jacob also made this promise, “If God will be with me and protect me on this journey which I am making and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and if I return safe and sound to my father’s house, then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  shall be my God,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  and this stone which I have set up as a pillar will be a house of God. And of all that you give me I will surely give a tenth to you.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 29]</p>

<h5>Leah and Rachel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jacob continued on his journey and arrived at the land of the people of the East.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He looked and saw a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep lying down by it; for from that well they watered the flocks; but there was a large stone over the well.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds used to roll away the stone and water the sheep and then put the stone back in its place over the well. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jacob said to the men, “My friends, from where do you come?” They said, “We are from Haran.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He said to them, “Is all well with him?” They said, “All is well; indeed, this is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  H e said, “See, the sun is still high! It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep and feed them.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll away the stone from the well; then we will water the sheep.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she was a shepherdess.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, she ran and told her father. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  As soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, put his arms around him, kissed him many times, and brought him to his home. When Jacob told Laban all that had happened,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” So he remained with him a whole month. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you serve me for nothing simply because you are related to me? Tell me what shall be your wages?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Leah’s eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Jacob loved Rachel, and so he said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Laban said, “It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to any other man. Stay with me.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days, because he loved her so. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is up, and let me marry her.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  In the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob received her as his wife.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  At the same time Laban gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When in the morning Jacob found it was Leah, he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Laban said, “It is not the custom among us to give the younger in marriage before the older.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Remain with this one during the marriage week, then we will give you the other also for the service which you will give me during seven more years.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Jacob did so: he remained with Leah during the marriage week. Then Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  and his slave-girl Bilhah to serve Rachel.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and loved Rachel more than Leah. So he had to serve Laban seven years more. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  saw that Leah was spurned, he gave her the gift of motherhood; Rachel, however, was barren.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So Leah gave birth to a son whom she named Reuben [Note:   Behold a son  ] ; for she said, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has seen my affliction; now my husband will love me.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  She gave birth to another son; and said, “Because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has heard that I am spurned, he has given me this one also”; and she called his name Simeon [Note:   Hearing  ] .  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  She gave birth to another son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons”; therefore his name was called Levi [Note:   Attached  ] .  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  She gave birth to another son and said, “This time I will praise the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ”; therefore she called his name Judah [Note:   Praise  ]  then she stopped having children. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 30]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she was jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, “Give me children or else I will die.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place? Who has withheld offspring from you?”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  She said, “Here is my slave-girl Bilhah, go to her, so that she may bear sons who can be laid on my knees and I also may obtain children though her.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl for a wife, and Jacob slept with her.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Rachel said, “God has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son.” So she called his name Dan [Note:   He judged  ] . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Rachel said, “With superhuman wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed”; so she called his name Naphtali [Note:   Obtained by wrestling  ] . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took Zilpah her slave-girl, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl bore Jacob a son.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Leah said, “Fortunate!” and she called his name Gad.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and Leah said, “Happy am I! Now women will call me happy”, and she called his name Asher. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  One time, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband, that you would also take away my son’s mandrakes?” Rachel said, “In exchange for your son’s mandrakes, Jacob can sleep with you tonight.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So when Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You sleep with me tonight, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  God heard Leah’s prayer, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Leah said, “God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave-girl to my husband”; so she called his name Issachar [Note:   There is a hire  ] .  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  She said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons”; and she called him Zebulun [Note:   Dwelling  ] .  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And afterwards she had a daughter and named her Dinah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then God remembered Rachel and heard her prayer and gave her a child.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  She conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  She called his name Joseph [Note:   He will add  ] , saying, “the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will add to me another son.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, so that I may go to my own place, and to my country.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, so that I may go; for you know the service which I have rendered you.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes — I have divined that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has blessed me for your sake.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  State exactly to me your wages and I will pay them.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Jacob answered him, “You know how I have served you and what your cattle have become under my care;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  for it was little which you had before I came, but now it has greatly increased, since the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has blessed you wherever I went. But now, when am I to provide for my own house as well?”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Laban said, “What should I give you?” 

<p> Jacob said, “You do not need to give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock; I will again keep it.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  If I can go through all your flock today, and remove from it every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these will be my wages.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  So my honesty will testify for me later, when you come to inspect my wages: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs has been stolen by me.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Laban said, “Good, let it be as you say.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  But he removed that day the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were striped and spotted, every one that had white on it, and all the black ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hands of his sons.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then he put the distance of a three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Jacob, however, took fresh rods of white poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  He set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink (and they conceived when they came to drink)  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  so that the flocks conceived before the rods. Therefore the flocks brought forth striped, speckled and spotted offspring.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Jacob separated the lambs, and he set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and the black animals in the flock of Laban and he put his own droves apart and did not put them near Laban’s flock. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Whenever the stronger animals of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the rods.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  But when the animals were weak, he did not put them in.  In this way the weaker became Laban’s, and the stronger Jacobs’s. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  So the man increased in wealth exceedingly, and had large flocks, and male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 31]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Jacob heard Laban’s sons say, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from that which was our father’s he has acquired all these riches.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now Jacob observed that Laban was not so favorably inclined to him as formerly.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your ancestors, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and said to them, “I see that your father is not so favorably inclined toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has been with me.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  You know that I have served your father with all my strength.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Your father, however, has deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  If your father said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled offspring, but if he said: ‘The striped will be your wages,’ then all the flock have striped offspring.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God has taken away the possessions of your father and given them to me.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  At the time when the flock breed, I looked up, and saw in a dream, that the he-goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and piebald.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The messenger of God said to me in a dream, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And he said, ‘Look! All the he-goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and piebald: for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar of stone, where you made a vow to me. Now arise, leave this land, and return to the land where you were born.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “There is no longer any inheritance for us in our father’s house.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Are we not considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us and goes on to consume the money paid for us.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Since all the riches which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children’s, do whatever God has told you to do.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Jacob rose up and put his sons and his wives on camels,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and drove away all his cattle and all the cattle which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And while Laban was gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household gods that were her father’s.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean — he did not tell him that he was going to flee.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  So he fled with all he had; crossing the river Euphrates heading towards the hill-country of Gilead. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When it was reported to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  he took his tribesmen with him, and pursued him for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him, “Take care that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country; and Laban with his relatives encamped in same hill country of Gilead. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of war!  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Why did you flee secretly, stealing away from me without telling me? I would have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp —  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  but you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters. You have acted foolishly.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  It was in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, ‘Take care that you do not speak to Jacob, neither good nor bad.’  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But now, since you are surely going because you long so earnestly for your father’s house, why have you stolen my gods?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The one with whom you find your gods will be put to death; in the presence of our kinsmen investigate for yourself what is with me and take it.” Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s gods.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s, and into the tent of the two slave-girls, but he did not find his gods. Then he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered Rachel’s.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel’s saddle and was sitting on them, so that when Laban had searched all about the tent, he did not find them.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  She said to her father, “Do not be angry that I cannot rise before you, my lord, for it is that time of the month that women have.” And though he searched thoroughly, he did not find the household gods. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then Jacob became angry and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said, “What is my offense, that you have pursued hotly after me?  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Alhough you have gone through all through my things, what have you found of all your household possessions? Declare it here before my kinsmen and yours, so that they may decide which of us two is in the right.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  In all these twenty years that have I been with you, your ewes and she-goats have not miscarried their young, neither did I eat the rams of your flocks.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  I did not bring to you the animals which were killed by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it myself; from my hand you required compensation, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  This was how I was: in the day the heat consumed me, and by night the frost, and sleep deserted me.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty. But God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and he rebuked you last night.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Then Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine, but what can I do today for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne?  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Come, let us make a solemn agreement, I and you, and let there be a witness between me and you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar,  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  and said to the members of his family, “Gather stones.” When they had taken stones and made a heap, they ate there by the heap.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Laban called it Jegar-sahaduthap [Note:   Heap of witness  ] ; but Jacob called it Galeed [Note:   Heap of witness  ] .  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  “This heap”, Laban said, “is witness between me and you today.” This is why it was called Galeed,  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  and Mizpah [Note:   Place of watching  ] , for Laban said, “May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  watch between me and you when we are absent one from another,  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  so that you may not maltreat my daughters nor take other wives besides my daughters. No one is with us; but beware: God is witness between me and you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Moreover, Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and the pillar which I have set up between me and you.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  This heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I should not pass beyond this heap to you and that you must not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, with hostile intent.  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor” (the God of their ancestors) “judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  Then Jacob offered a sacrifice there on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread, and they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  Then early in the morning Laban arose, and, when he had kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them, he departed and returned to his home. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 32]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp;” so he named the place “Mahanaim [Note:   Company  ] .” 

<h5>Jacob prepares to meet Esau</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, which is the territory of the Edomites.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He gave them this command, “Say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob declares, I have lived with Laban and have stayed until now.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I have oxen and donkeys, flocks and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may win your favor.’”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The messengers returned to Jacob with the report, “We came to your brother Esau, even as he was coming to meet you with four hundred men.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Jacob was greatly alarmed and worried. So he divided the people that were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two parts  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and said, “If Esau comes to the one and attacks and destroys it, then the other which is left can escape.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Jacob also prayed, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac,  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do well by you,’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the faithfulness which you have shown to me, your servant. I passed over the Jordan river with only my staff, and now I have these two groups,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear that he will come and attack me and kill the mothers and the children.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Remember your promise to make me prosper and my descendants as many as the sand of the seashore, uncountable.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  After spending the night there, Jacob took from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  thirty milch camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten young donkeys.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  These he put, each drove by itself, in the care of his servants and said to them, “Go on before me and leave a space between the droves.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He gave those in front this command: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose are these before you?’  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  then you shall say, ‘To your servant Jacob; it is a present sent by him to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is just behind us.’”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jacob also commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, to make the same answer,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and to say, “Jacob himself is just behind us.” For he said to himself, “I will please him with the present that goes before me, and then, when I meet him, perhaps he will welcome me.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  So he sent the present over before him; but he himself spent that night in the camp. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Later that night he rose up and took his two wives, his two slave-girls, and his eleven children, and sent them over the river Jabbok. 

<h5>Jacob wrestles</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After he had sent them accross with all his belongings,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Jacob was left alone, and someone wrestled with him until daybreak.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When he saw that he did not win against Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated, as he wrestled with him.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then he said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So he said to him, “What is your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then he said, “Your name shall be no longer Jacob, but Israel [Note:   which means Struggler with God  ] ; for you have struggled with God and with mortals and have won.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Jacob asked him, “Tell me, I pray, your name.” He said,“Why do you ask my name?” So he blessed him there.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Jacob called the place Penuel [Note:   which means Face of God  ] , for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life has been saved.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The sun rose as soon as he had passed beyond Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  This is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle, which is at the socket of the hip, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip on the thigh muscle. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 33]</p>

<h5>Reconciliation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two slave-girls.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He put the slave-girls and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son Joseph in the rear.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Jacob himself went in front of them, and he bowed down to the ground seven times, as he drew near to his brother.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms about his neck, and kissed him, and they wept. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “The children whom God has so kindly given me.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the slave-girls with their children came up and bowed down to the ground.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Leah and her children also came and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed down before Esau. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Esau asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob answered, “To win your friendship, my lord.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Jacob replied, “No, if now I have won your favor, receive this present from me, because seeing your face when you welcomed me was like seeing the face of God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Take, I beg of you, the gift that I bring to you, for God has been generous to me and I have enough.” So he urged Esau until he took it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Esau said, “Let us set out on our way, and let me travel with you.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are delicate, and I have flocks and herds with their young; if they are overdriven one day, all the flocks will die.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Let my lord, I beg of you, go on ahead of me, and I will proceed leisurely by stages according to the pace of the cattle which I am driving and of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then Esau said, “Let me at least leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob replied, “What need is there? Let me only enjoy the favor of my lord.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So Esau turned back that day on his way to Seir. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built there a house for himself, and made huts for his cattle; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth [Note:   Huts  ] . 

<h5>Dinah and Shechem</h5> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-Aram, and encamped before the city.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He bought the piece of ground where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for four hundred shekels;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and he erected there an altar and called it El, God of Israel. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 34]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Dinah the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of the region.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When Sheeham the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her and violated her,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  but his heart was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob — he loved her and spoke endearingly to her.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Therefore Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl for my wife.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Jacob heard that Shecham had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob said nothing until they came home.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Meanwhile Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him and with his sons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The sons of Jacob came in from the field, and when they heard the news, the men were indignant and became very angry, because Shechem had committed a shameful crime in raping Jacob’s daughter: such a thing ought never to be done.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. I beg you: give her to him as a wife  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then you can settle with us, and the land will be open before you. Remain, go about, and settle down in it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And Shechem said to Dinah’s father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and I will give you what you ask of me.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Demand of me an exceedingly large gift for yourselves and a dowry for the bride, and I shall give all you ask of me; only give me the girl for my wife.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, declaring, (because he had defiled their sister Dinah),  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “We cannot do this. We cannot give our sister to someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Only on this condition will we make an alliance with you: if you will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then will we give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and will live with you and we will become one people.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But if you will not listen to us and allow yourselves to be circumcised, then we will take Dinah and be gone.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Their proposal pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The young man (who was honored above all the house of his father) did not hesitate to do the thing demanded, because he was smitten with Jacob’s daughter.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “These men are peaceably disposed toward us, let them remain in the land and go about in it; the land is broad enough for them on every side and in every direction; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Only on this condition will these men consent to settle with us to become one people, namely, that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Shouldn’t their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? Let us make an alliance with them so that they will live with us.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then all who went in and out of the gate of his city agreed with Hamor and Shechem. And every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  On the third day when they were still in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took swords and came upon the city unawares,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went away.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The other sons of Jacob came on the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and all that which was in the city and all that which was in the field.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  All their wealth, and all their children and their wives, they took captive, and made all that was in the houses their prey.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought me into trouble, in that you have made me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. Since I have only a few people, if they gather themselves together against me they will attack me — and I and my house will be destroyed.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a whore?” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 35]</p>

<h5>Jacob goes to Bethel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So Jacob said to his household, and to everyone who was with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Let us arise and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the journey which I was making.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their possession, and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They set out on their journey, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is, Bethel). He and all the people that were with him came to Bethel.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He built there an altar, and named the place El-Bethel [Note:   The God of the house of God  ] ; because there God revealed himself to him, when he fled from the presence of his brother.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried below Bethel under the oak. Therefore its name was called Allon-bacuth [Note:   Oak of Weeping  ] . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God appeared again to Jacob when he came from Paddanaram, and blessed him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  God said to him, “Now your name is Jacob: but your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel.” So he called his name Israel.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  God said to him, “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and become numerous; a nation and a multitude of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and to your descendants after you.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  God went up from him at that place where he spoke with him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Jacob set up at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and poured a drink-offering and oil on it.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then they set out from Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into a hard and painful labor.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  At the hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; for now you will have another son.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And, as her life was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni [Note:   Son of my Sorrow  ] ; but his father called him Benjamin [Note:   Son of the right hand  ] .  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and Jacob set up a pillar on her grave: that is the Pillar of Rachel’s Grave, which stands until this day. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Israel journeyed, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-Eder [Note:   Tower of the Flock  ] .  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah and Israel heard of it. 

<p> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s slave-girl: Dan and Naphtali;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s slave-girl: Gad and Asher (these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram). 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  The length of Isaac’s life was a one hundred and eighty years.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Isaac beathed his last, and was gathered to his father’s kin, old and satisfied with life; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 36]</p>

<h5>Genealogy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now these are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom).  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; and Basemath bore Reuel;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau that were born to him in the land of Canaan. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the members of his household and his cattle and all his beasts and all his possessionse which he had gathered in the land of Canaan and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For their possessions were too many for them to live together; and the land where they sojourned could not support them because of their cattle.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir (Esau is Edom). 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  These are the descendants of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir:  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Timna was the concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz; and she bore Amalek to him. These are the sons of Esau’s wife Adah.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  These were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Esau’s wife Zibeon she bore Jeush to Esau, and Jalam, and Korah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  These are the chiefs descended from Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the original inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of his father Zibeon.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead. The name of his city was Avith.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  These are the names of the chiefs decended from Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. This was Esau, the father of the Edomites.

<h5>Joseph sold into slavery</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jacob made his home in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived as a resident foreigner.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Joseph at the age of seventeen was a shepherd with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s slave wives. He brought a bad report about them to their father.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now Jacob loved his son Joseph, who was born in his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all his other sons, they hated him and could not speak to him in a friendly manner. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Joseph also had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they hated him still more.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  This is what he said to them, “Hear, if you will, this dream which I have had;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  for as we were binding sheaves in the field, my sheaf rose up and remained standing, while your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  His brothers said to him, “Do you think you will be king over us? And rule us?” So they hated him still more because of his dreams and his words. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “I have had another dream, and it seemed to me that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But when he told it to his father and his brothers, his father reproved him and said, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Am I and your mother and your brothers supposed to bow down to the earth before you?”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Therefore his brothers envied him; but his father kept the matter in mind. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When his brothers went to pasture his father’s flocks in Shechem,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks in Shechem? Come now, I will send you to them.” Joseph replied, “I am ready.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So his father said to him, “Go, see whether all goes well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me back word.” So he sent him out from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  There a man found him, as he was wandering in the field, and the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  He said, “I am looking for my brothers; tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  When they saw him in the distance, before he came to them, they conspired against him to kill him.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They said one to another, “See, here comes that master-dreamer.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Come on, let us kill him, and throw him into one of the pits, and then we will say, ‘A fierce beast has devoured him’; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Rueben, however, when he heard it, saved him from their hands by saying, “Let us not take his life.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Reuben also said to them, “Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit, that is in the wilderness; but do not harm him,” He planned to save him from their hands in order to restore him to his father.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Nevertheless, when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his long robe, the robe with sleeves;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and they took him and threw him into the pit. But the pit was empty, there being no water in it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then they sat down to eat bread, and when they looked up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us do him no violence, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” So his brothers listened to him;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and when the Midianite merchants passed by, pulled Joseph up from the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought him to Egypt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When Reuben returned to the pit and found Joseph gone, he tore his clothes in sorrow.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then his brothers took Joseph’s robe, killed a he-goat, dipped the long-sleeved robe in the blood,  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  tore it and sent it to their father, saying, “We found this; see whether it is your son’s robe or not.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph without doubt is torn in pieces.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth about his waist, and mourned for his son many days.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  All his sons and his daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, saying, “I shall go down to the grave mourning for my son.” So Joseph’s father wept for him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to one of Pharaoh’s court officials, Potiphar, the captain of the guard. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 38]</p>

<h5>Judah and Tamar</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About that time Judah left his kinsmen, and settled near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Judah saw there a daughter of a Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he married her. He lay with her,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and she conceived, and bore a son, and he named him Er.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then she conceived again, and bore a son and named him Onan.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  She bore still another son, and named him Shelah: and it was at Chezib that she bore him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now Judah found a wife for Er his eldest son, and her name was Tamar.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But Er, Judah’s eldest son, was wicked in the sight of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  took his life.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Judah said to Onan, “Go and lie with your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, in order not to raise up offspring for his brother.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  What he did was evil in the sight of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> : therefore he took his life also. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah my son is grown up”; for he said to himself, “I will not let him marry her, he must not die like his brothers.” So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  After many days had passed, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to see about his sheep-shearers at Timnah, with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Someone told Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil. She sat, veiled, in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up without her being given to him as wife.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; because she had veiled her face.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So he turned aside to her by the roadside, and said, “Permit me, I pray you, to lie with you.” For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me to lie with me?”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  He said, “What pledge should I give you?” And she said, “Your seal-ring and your chain and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her, and lay with her, and she became pregnant.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And she got up, and went away, and took off her veil, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now when Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the sacred prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside?” They replied, “There has been no sacred prostitute here.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So he returned to Judah, and said, “I have not found her; and the men of the place said, ‘There has been no sacred prostitute here.’”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Judah said, “Let her keep the pledge, otherwise we will be put to shame. I have sent this goat, and you have not found her.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Now after about three months, Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore and is pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her forth and let her be burnt.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But when she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these things belong, I am with child.” She also said, “Look at them and see if you know whose these are, the seal-ring and the chain and the staff.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When Judah recognized them, he said, “She is more in the right than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” But he did not lie with her again. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  When her time came to give birth, it was found that twins were in her womb.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  While she was in labor, one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound on his hand a bright red thread, saying, “This one came out first.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  But he drew back his hand, and his brother came out, and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore he was named Perez [Note:   Breach  ] .  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Afterward his brother came out, who had the bright red thread on his hand; therefore he was named Zerah [Note:   Red  ] . 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 39]</p>

<h5>Joseph in Egypt</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officers, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with Joseph, so that he prospered; and he remained in the house of his master the Egyptian.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When his master saw that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with him and made everything that he undertook prosper,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Joseph won his confidence and became his personal attendant. He also made him overseer of his household and placed all that he had in his care.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  blessed the Egyptian’s household for Joseph’s sake, and the blessing of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Leaving all that he had in Joseph’s charge, he knew nothing about his affairs except about the food which he ate. Also Joseph was handsome and attractive. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After these honors had come to Joseph, his master’s wife directed her glances toward him and tried to tempt him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But he refused, saying to her, “See, my master knows nothing about what I do in the house, and he has put all that he has in my charge.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  No one has greater authority in this house than I, and he has kept back nothing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wrong and sin against God?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Day after day she tempted Joseph, but he did not listen to her nor accept her advances.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  One day, however, when he went into the house to do his work and when none of the men of the household were at home,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  she caught hold of his garment and tried to seduce him; but he left his garment in her hand and fled out of the house. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  she called to her household servants and said to them,  “See, the master has brought a Hebrew in to insult us. He came to me to rape me, and I screamed loudly;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and when he heard me scream, he left his garment with me and ran out of the house.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  She kept his garment by her until his master came home;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  then she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us came to me to insult me;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and when I screamed he left his garment with me and fled.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When Joseph’s master heard the statements which his wife made to him, his anger was aroused;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and he took Joseph and put him into the prison, in the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So he was left there in prison.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and enabled him to win the favor of the keeper of the prison,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  so that he placed all the prisoners in Joseph’s charge and made him responsible for whatever they did there.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The keeper did not have to concern himself about anything Joseph was responsible for, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with him and gave him success in everything he did. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 40]</p>

<h5>The Two Dreams</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Some time after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their master the king of Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  so that Pharaoh was angry with these two officers and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he waited on them;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and they remained in confinement for some time. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Meanwhile the king of Egypt’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, both had dreams the same night, each with a particular meaning.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When Joseph came in to them in the morning, he saw plainly that they were sad.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So he asked Pharaoh’s officers, “Why do you look so sad today?”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  They answered. “We have had a dream and there is no one who can interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not the interpretations of dreams belong to God? Tell them to me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine before me,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and on the vine were three branches, and as if budding it put out blossoms and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into his cup and gave the cup to Pharaoh.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  within three days Pharaoh will release you from prison and restore you to your office, and you will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But when all goes well with you, remember me, show kindness to me and speak in my behalf to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  for I was unjustly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also saw something in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and in the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  within three days Pharaoh will take off your head and hang you on a tree, and the birds shall eat your flesh.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his officials. Then he released the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He restored the chief butler to his office, so that he again gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  but the chief baker he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 41]</p>

<h5>Pharaoh’s Dream</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: as he stood by the Nile,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  he saw coming up from the Nile seven cows, good-looking and fat, and they had been feeding in the river grass.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, bad-looking and lean, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The bad-looking cows ate up the seven good-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Afterward he slept and had a second dream and saw seven ears, plump and good, growing up on one stalk.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Also seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up after them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and realized that it was a dream. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In the morning Pharaoh’s mind was disturbed; so he sent and called all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I now must remind you of my offenses:  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Pharaoh was very angry with his servants and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  We both had dreams the same night, each with a special meaning.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  There was also with us a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guard; and we told him and he interpreted our dreams to us, to each of us according to his dream.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Our dreams came true exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved his face and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Joseph answered Pharaoh, “Not I; God only can give Pharaoh a satisfactory answer.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream as I stood on the bank of the Nile,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I saw seven cows, fat and good-looking, which had been feeding in the river grass.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  There came up after them seven more cows, thin, and bad-looking and lean, worse than I ever saw in all the land of Egypt;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and the lean and bad-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and when they had eaten them up, one could not tell that they had eaten them, for they were still as bad-looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Again I dreamed and saw seven ears, plump and good, grow up on one stalk;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  then seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprang up after them;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I have told the dream to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it to me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s two dreams signify the same thing; God has made known to Pharaoh what he is about to do.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. It is one dream.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are also seven years, and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind represent seven years of famine.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  That is why I said to Pharaoh, ‘God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.’  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt are coming,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  and they will be followed by seven years of famine, so that all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume all that the land produces;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and plenty will not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  “The dream came twice to Pharaoh to indicate that its fulfilment is assured and that God will soon make it come true.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discreet and wise and place him in control of the land of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Pharaoh should take action and appoint overseers over the land and collect one-fifth of all the produce of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Let them gather all the food of these good years that come and store the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them hold it for food in the cities.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  The food will furnish a supply for the land during the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt, so that the people of the land will not perish because of the famine.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his officials;  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  and Pharaoh said to his officials, “Can we find one like this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?”  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  You will be at the head of my dominion, and all my people shall be ruled as you command, only on the throne I will be superior to you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have appointed you over all the land of Egypt.”  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his finger and put it upon Joseph’s finger and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a golden collar about his neck.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  He also made him ride in the second-best chariot which he had; and they cried before him, “Attention!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one may lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Josephs’s authority was over all Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  and so at the age of thirty Joseph was commissioned by Pharaoh, king of Egypt and went out as the head of the land of Egypt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  In the seven plenteous years there were bountiful harvests,  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  and Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven plenteous years, which were in the land of Egypt, and stored the food in the cities, putting in each city the products of the fields about it.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Joseph stored up grain as the sand of the sea, in great quantities, until he ceased to keep account, because it could not be measured. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  Two sons were born to Joseph and Asenath before the year of famine came.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Joseph named the eldest Manasseh [Note:   Making Forget  ] ; for he said, “God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s household.”  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  He named the second son Ephraim [Note:   Fruitful  ] ; for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were over,  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food,  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  for when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  So when the famine was universal throughout the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians: but the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  The peoples of all lands came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe throughout the world. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 42]</p>

<h5>Joseph’s brothers come to Egypt</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, and he said to his sons, “Why do you stand looking at each other?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt; go down there and buy for us, so that we may live and not die.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s own brother, with his brothers; for he feared that some harm might come to him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So the sons of Jacob went among others to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Therefore Joseph’s brothers came and bowed before him with their faces to the earth.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When Joseph saw his brothers he knew them, but he acted as a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them and said, “Where do you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not know him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Joseph also remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them and said to them, “You spies! You have come to find out the weaknesses of the land.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But they said to him, “No my lord; your servants have come to buy food.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But he said to them, “No, you have come to see the weaknesses of the land.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  They replied, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Joseph said to them, “It is just as I said to you, you are spies.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  By this you shall be tested: as sure as Pharaoh lives you shall not go away unless your youngest brother comes here.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that it may be proved whether you are telling the truth or not. Or else, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are indeed spies.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So he put them all into prison for three days. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God:  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain in prison, but you go, carry grain to supply the needs of your households  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and you shall not die.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  They did as Joseph commanded, but they said to one another, “We are indeed guilty because of the way we treated our brother, for when we saw his distress and when he pleaded with us, we would not listen; therefore this trouble has come upon us.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Reuben added, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’ but you would not listen? Therefore now his very blood is required.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  They did not know, however, that Joseph understood them, for he had spoken to them through an interpreter.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But he turned away from them and wept; then he turned back and spoke to them, and, taking Simeon from among them, bound him before their eyes.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with grain and to restore each man’s money to his sack and to give them provision for the journey; and it was done to them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  So they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  When they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw the silver at the top of the sack.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  He said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned; here it is in my pack.” They were dismayed and fearful, and said to one another, “What has God done to us?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened, saying,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  “The man who is master in that land spoke harshly to us and imprisoned us as spies.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  We said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies;  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  we are twelve brothers, sons of the same father; one is no longer living, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But the man who is master in that land said to us, ‘This is how I will discover if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take the grain to supply the needs of your households and depart.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men; and I will restore your brother to you and you shall be free to go about in the land.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  As they were emptying their sacks, they found that each man’s purse of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their purses filled with money, they were afraid.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Jacob their father said to them, “You have robbed me of my children: Joseph is no longer living and Simeon is no longer here, and you would take Benjamin also. All this misfortune has overtaken me!”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death, if I do not return him to you. Put him in my charge and I will bring him back to you.”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  But Jacob said, “My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he only is left. If harm should come to him on the way by which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 43]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The famine was severe in the land;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and when Joseph’s brothers had eaten all the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, and buy us some more grain.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But Judah replied, “The man warned us: ‘You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and buy you food,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  but if you will not let him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You will not be able to see me unless your brother is with you.’”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jacob said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They replied, “The man asked particularly about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ So we answered his questions as he asked them. How were we to know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that both we and you and our little ones may live and not die.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I will be surety for him, you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for if we had not lingered, surely we would now have returned the second time.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Therefore their father said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the products of the land in your jars and carry down a present to the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Take twice as much money with you, carrying back the money that was returned in your sacks; perhaps there was a mistake.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Take also your brother and go again to the man,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and may God Almighty grant that the man may be merciful to you and release Benjamin and your other brother. But if I am robbed of my sons, I am bereaved indeed!”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So the men took the present and twice as much money and Benjamin, and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, kill animals, and prepare the meal, for these men will eat with me at noon.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He did as Joseph directed, and brought the men into Joseph’s house.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But the brothers were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house, and they said, “We are being brought in on account of the money that was returned in our grain-saeks at our first visit, so that he can overpower and arrest us and take us as slaves, together with our donkeys.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So when they came near to Joseph’s steward, they spoke to him at the door of the house  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time only to buy food;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and when we reached home, we opened our sacks and discovered every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back with us.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  We have also brought down with us other money with which to buy food; we do not know who put our money into our sacks.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  He replied, “Be calm, don’t be afraid; your God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks; I received your full payment.” 

<p> Then he brought Simeon out to them.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The steward also conducted the men to Joseph’s house and gave them water with which to wash their feet, and he gave their donkeys fodder.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then they made ready the present in anticipation of Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat there. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When Joseph came into the house, they gave him the present which they had brought and bowed down low before him.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  He asked them regarding their welfare and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still living?”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  They replied, “Your servant, our father, is well; he is still alive.” Then they bowed their heads and made obeisance. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When Joseph looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, his own mother’s son, he said. “Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?” and he added, “God be gracious to you, my son.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then because he was overcome with emotion for his brother he sought a place to weep; and he went into his room and wept there.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then he bathed his face and came out and controlling himself he said, “Bring on the food.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So they brought food for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for to do so is abhorrent to the Egyptians.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Joseph’s brothers were seated before him, the eldest according to his right as the oldest and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at each other in astonishment.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Joseph had portions served to them from the food before him; but Benjamin’s portions were five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 44]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then he gave this command to the steward of his household: “Fill the men’s grain-sacks with food, as much as they can carry,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest and the money too that he paid for his grain.” He did as Joseph commanded. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  As soon as the morning light appeared, the men were sent away, together with their donkeys.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When they had gone out of the city, but were not yet far away, Joseph commanded his steward, “Follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Why have you stolen my silver cup, that from which my master drinks and by which he divines the future? You have done wrong in so doing!’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So the steward overtook them and said these words to them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as this? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Remember that we brought back to you from the hind of Canaan the money which we found in our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If one of us is found with the goblet then let him die, and we will be my lord’s slaves.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He said, “Let it now be as you have said: he with whom it is found will be my slave; but the rest may go free.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then each one hastily took down his sack to the ground and opened it;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and the steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then they tore their clothes in sorrow, and every man loaded his donkey and returned to the city. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they threw themselves before him on the ground.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can divine secrets?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Judah replied, “What can we say, my lord? What can we plead or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. See, both we and he also in whose possession the cup was found are my lord’s slaves.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But Joseph said, “Far be it from me that I should do such a thing! The man in whose possession the cup was found must be my slave; but you yourselves go up in peace to your father.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Judah came close to him and said, “My lord, let your servant, I beg of you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger be kindled against your servant; for you are as great as Pharaoh.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  My lord, you asked us, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And we said to you, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. Since his brother is dead, he is the only son of his mother who is left; and his father loves him.’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  You said to us, ‘Bring him down to me, so that I can see him.’  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But we said to you, my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he should leave his father, his father would die.’  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then you said to us, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not be able to see me again.’  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When we went up to your servant, my father, we told him your words, my lord;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food.’  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go; for we cannot see the man unless our youngest brother is with us.’  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and one went missing, and I said that surely he was torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  If you take this one also from me, and harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.’  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Now if I return to your servant, my father, and the boy with whose life his heart is bound up is not with us,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  then when he sees that there is no boy, he will die, and we, your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Indeed, my lord, I personally became surety for the boy to my father, when I said, ‘If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame in my father’s eyes forever.’  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Now therefore let me, I beg of you, remain instead of the boy as your slave, my lord, but let the boy go up with his brothers.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  For how can I go up to my father, if the boy is not with me, and see the pain and sorrow that would come upon my father.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 45]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who were standing by him; so he cried out, “Let everyone leave me.” So nobody stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh’s court heard. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him for they were frightened in his presence.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, I beg of you.” So they came near. And he said, “I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Do not be troubled nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here, because God sent me before you to preserve life.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For the famine has already been two years in the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  God sent me before you to keep you alive through a great deliverance and give you descendants on the earth.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So now it clear that it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh and master of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Go up quickly to my father and say to him, ‘Your son Joseph says: God has made me master of all Egypt, come down to me without delay.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me with your children and children’s children, with your flocks and your herds and all that you have,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and there I will provide for you. Otherwise you, together with your household and all that you have, will starve; for there will be five more years of famine.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now you and my brother Benjamin see that it is really me, Joseph, who is speaking to you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Tell my father all about my honor in Egypt and what you have seen, and you must quickly bring him down here.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He also kissed all his brothers and wept with them; and after that his brothers talked with him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The report that Joseph’s brothers had arrived spread in Pharaoh’s palace, and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants greatly.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts, go to the land of Canaan,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the best that the land affords.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Now you are commanded to do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Also pay no attention to your household goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The sons of Jacob did as commanded. 

<p> So Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharaoh’s orders and provisions for the journey.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  To each of them he gave a change of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  To his father he sent the following gifts: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father on the journey. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “See that you do not quarrel on the journey!”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  They told him, “Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Then Jacob’s heart stood still, for he could not believe them.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and he, Israel, said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 46]</p>

<h5>The promise to Israel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Israel set out on his journey with all that he had. He went to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” He answered. “Here I am.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I myself will go down with you into Egypt; and I will surely bring you up again; and Joseph will be the one who closes your dying eyes.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Jacob left Beersheba, his sons carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They took their herds and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his family;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  his sons and grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, he brought all his family to Egypt. 

<h5>Geneaology</h5> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now these are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his family, who came to Egypt. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah. He had thirty-three descendants by Leah in total.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  These are the children of Zilpah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She bore sixteen children to Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The children of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Joseph in the land of Egypt fathered Manasseh and Ephraim, whose mother was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  These fourteen were Rachel and Jacobs’s descendants.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The sons of Dan: Hashum.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  These seven are the sons of Bilhah, the slave-girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore seven children to Jacob. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  All the people belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including the wives of his sons, were sixty-six in total.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt; all the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy. 

<h5>Israel in Egypt</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, so that he might show him the way to Goshen.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When they came into the land of Goshen, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to Goshen to meet Jacob his father, and when he presented himself to him Jacob fell on his neck and wept there a long time. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then Jacob said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Now the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all that they have.’  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When Pharaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  you must say, ‘We, your servants have been keepers of cattle all our lives, both we and our fathers,’ so that you might be allowed to live in the province of Goshen, for shepherds are looked down upon by the Egyptians.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 47]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers with their sheep and cattle and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and now they are in the province of Goshen.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Pharaoh said to them, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “We are shepherds, both we and our fathers.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land, because there is no pasture for our flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. We beg of you, to let us stay in the province of Goshen.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since your father and your brothers have come to you,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  the land of Egypt is at your disposal. Settle them in the best part of it. Let them stay in the province of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Joseph also brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Jacob answered, “I have lived a hundred and thirty years; few and hard have been the years of my life, and they have not been as many as those that my ancestors lived on earth.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  After Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh’s presence.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Joseph gave his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, near Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Joseph also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his father’s household according to the number of their little children. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There was no bread in all the land; since the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Joseph gathered in all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread: for why should we die before your eyes because our money fails?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then Joseph said, “Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money has failed.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So they brought their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their cattle. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from you, my lord, now that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are yours; there is nothing left in the your sight, but our bodies and our lands.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Take possession of us and our land in return for bread, and we and our land will become personal possessions of Pharaoh; and give us seed, so that we will live, and not die, so that the land does not become desolate.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  As for the people, he reduced them to slavery from one end of Egypt to the other.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the priests had a definite allowance from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Hence they did not sell their land. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then Joseph said to the people, “I have bought you and you land today for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  At the ingatherings, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed for the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  They replied, “You have saved our lives; let us find favor in your sight, lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  So Joseph made it a law, still in force today, that Pharaoh should have a fifth; only the land of the priests did not come into the possession of Pharaoh. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired possessions in it and had many children and became exceedingly numerous.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Jacob lived for seventeen years in Egypt and died at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven. 

<h5>Deaths of Jacob and Joseph</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When the time drew near for Jacob to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now you will do me a favor, put your hand under my thigh and swear that you will act kindly and faithfully with me. Do not bury me, I beg of you, in Egypt;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  but when I lie down to sleep with my ancestors, carry, me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place.” Joseph replied, “I will do as you have requested.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Jacob said, “Give me your oath”; so Joseph gave him his oath; and Israel bowed toward the head of the bed. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 48]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now after these things, Joseph was told, “Your father is sick.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Jacob rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful, and numerous, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But your offspring, which you father after them, will be yours. Their inheritance will come from their older brothers.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, some distance from Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” Israel said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and now God has let me see your offspring as well.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Joseph took them from his father’s lap, and bowed with his face to the earth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Joseph took them both — Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand — and brought them near to him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim who was the younger and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands intentionally, for Manasseh was the eldest. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He then blessed Joseph, saying, “The God whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac revered and served, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long unto this day,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  the messenger who has delivered me from all evil, bless the boys; and let them be known as descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and let them grow into a multitude on the earth.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he seized his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; this one is the eldest; put your right hand upon his head.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know, he also will become a people, and he will shall be great, but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a populous nation.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So he blessed them that day and said, “The Israelites will invoke a blessing like your own, saying, ‘God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jacob said to Joseph, “See, I am about to die; but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As well I give you a mountain-slope which I took out of the power of the Amorites with my sword and bow.” 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 49]</p>

Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for the purpose of holding it as a burying-place.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The field and the cave that is in it which was purchased from the children of Heth.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When Jacob had finished giving these instructions to his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his ancestors. 

<p class="c-num">[Genesis 50]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Joseph fell upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Jacob;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and forty days were devoted to it, for this is the full period for embalming.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The Egyptians also mourned for him seventy days. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the members of Pharaoh’s court, saying, “If now you wish to do me a favor, speak to Pharaoh and say, Joseph’s father made him take an oath, saying, ‘See, I am dying; bury me in my grave which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Ask Pharaoh, ‘Let me go up, I beg of you, and bury my father; after that I will return.’”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you take an oath.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, all the elders of the land of Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their little ones, their sheep, and their cattle they left in the land of Goshen.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  There went up with him both chariots and horsemen, so that it was a very great company. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, they held there a great and impressive lamentation; and Joseph appointed a period of mourning for his father which lasted seven days.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is an impressive mourning among the Egyptians.” That is why that place across the Jordan is called, Ebel-Mizraim [Note:   Mourning of the Egyptians  ] . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Jacob’s sons did for him what he had commanded them:  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  they carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to hold as a place of burial.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  After he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father returned to Egypt. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When Joseph’s brothers realized that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will now hate us and fully punish us for all the evil which we did to him!”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They sent this message to him: “Your father commanded before he died,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  ‘Tell Joseph: Forgive, I beg of you, the wrongdoing and sin of your brothers, for they treated you basely.’ So now we beg of you forgive the wrongdoing of the servants of your father’s God.” 

<p> While they were speaking to him, Joseph began to weep,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, “See, we are your slaves.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid; for am I in the place of God?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  You plotted mischief against me, but God intended it for good, in order to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of the lives of many people.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now therefore do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.” He said this kindly, comforting them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Joseph remained in Egypt with his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and he saw Ephraim’s great-grandchildren; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were borne upon Joseph’s knees. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely remember you and bring you up from this land to the land which he promised by an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Joseph required an oath of the children of Israel, saying, “When God remembers you, as he surely will, then you must carry up my bones from here.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 1]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  ’Moses my servant is dead; now arise, go over this Jordan with all this people to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Every place upon which the sole of thy foot shall tread, to thee will I give it, as I promised Moses.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting sun shall be your boundary.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  No one shall be able to stand against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt bring this people into possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Only be very courageous and strong, to observe faithfully all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have success wherever thou goest.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  This law-book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest observe faithfully all that is written in it; for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and shalt have success.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Have I not commanded thee? Be courageous and strong! Fear not, neither be dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou goest.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, ’Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as a possession.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Also to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Remember the command which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, when he said, ’Jehovah your God is about to bring you to a settled abode and will give you this land.’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Your wives and your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you; but you – as many of you as are able to fight – shall pass over armed before your kinsmen and shall help them,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  until Jehovah hath given a settled abode to your kinsmen as to you and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is about to give them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the rising sun.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And they answered Joshua saying. All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Any one who shall rebel against your command and shall not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be courageous and strong. 

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Joshua the son of Nun sent secretly from Shittim two men as spies, saying. Go view the land and especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now it was told the king of Jericho, saying, There came some men here tonight from the Israelites to explore the land.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying. Bring forth the men who have come to you, for they have come to explore all the land.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said. It is true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When the time came to shut the gate at nightfall.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Accordingly the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan opposite the fords, and as soon as they that pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and said to the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that terror because of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are losing heart before you.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And as soon as we had heard it, we lost heart completely, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah yonr God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth beneath.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you will also deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But Rahab said to the men. Swear that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And the men said to her, We will be prepared to forfeit our lives for you, if you do not disclose this business of ours. It shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then she let them down by a rope through the window (for her house was so close beside the city wall that she dwelt upon the wall).  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And she said to them. Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers happen to find you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go on your way.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then the men said to her. We will be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down and you shall gather to yourself into the house, your father and your mother and your brothers, and all your father’s household.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And it shall be, if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if any one stays with you in the house, his blood shall be on our heads, if an injury befalls him.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But if you do disclose this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath to which you have made us swear.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And she said. Let it be as you say. So she sent them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So they went and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned. Now the pursuers sought for them in every direction, but did not find them.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then the two men returned, descending from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And they said to Joshua, Jehovah hath delivered all the land into our power; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land have lost heart before us. 

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 3]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and he and all the Israelites came t the Jodan and spent the night there before they moved over. Then they removed from Shittim.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now after three days the officers went through the midst of the camp  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God and the priest, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have never passed this way before.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Jehovah said to Joshus, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that I will be with thee as I was with Moses,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, you shall stand still in the waters of Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Joshua also said to the Israelites, Come hither and hear the words of Jehovah your God.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Joshua said, By this you shall know that a living God is among you, and that he will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites and the Jebusites.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Also take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, and they shall rise in a heap. And the waters that come down from above shall stand still.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant being before the people, that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And so when those who were crossing carrying the ark came to the Jordan – the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest – therefore when the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  the waters which came down from above stood still. Its waters rose up in a heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people stood opposite Jericho.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan. 

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  And it came to pass, when the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan, that Jehovah said to Joshua,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Command them saying, Take hence from the midst of the Jordan, (out of the place where the priests’ feet stood) twelve stones, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the camping-place, where you shall pass the night,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed of the Israelites, a man from each tribe,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and let every man of you lift a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do you mean by these stones?"  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  then you shall say to them, "Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off." and these stones shall be for a memorial to the Israelites forever.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The priests who carried the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. Then the people passed over quickly.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And it came to pass when all the people had finished the passage, that the ark of Jehovah passed over and the priests, in the presence of the people.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses commanded them;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Jehovah said to Joshua,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Command the priests who carry the ark of the law, that they come up out of the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And when the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up on the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho. 

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 5 ]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now when all the kings of the Amorites, who were to the west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the Israelites, until they were passed over, they lost heart, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make knives of flint, and circumcise again the Israelites the second time.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Joshua made him knives of flint and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeah Araloth (The hill of the foreskins).  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised the Israelites: all the people that came out of Egypt who were males, even all the men capable of fighting, died in the wilderness in the way, on the journey from Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness in the way on the journey from Egypt, had not been circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For the Israelites wandered forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men capable of fighting, who came out of Egypt, were destroyed, because they did not heed the mice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land concerning which, Jehovah gave oath to their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey.   <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But their children, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the journey.   <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were well again.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Jehovah said to Joshua, To-day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. So the name of that place has been called Gilgal (Rolling), to this day.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When now the Israelites encamped in Gilgal, they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the mouth in the evening in the plains of Jericho.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, on the very same day.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And ,Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?   <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And he said, Nay, but as Prince of the host of Jehovah have I now come. Then Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What has my lord to say to his servant?   <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And the Prince of Jehovah’s host said to Joshua, Take off thy sandals from thy feet; for the place on which thou art standing is holy. 

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 6]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Jericho had closed its gates and was closed on account of the Israelites; no one went out or in. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; and ye shall march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets.   <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy power Jericho, and its king, with the men capable of fighting.   <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And ye shall march around the city, all the warriors going about the city once. Thus shall ye do six days.   <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down of itself. And the seventh day the people shall go up every man straight before him.   <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah,   <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  therefore Joshua said to the people, March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah,   <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before, Jehovah shall pass on, while they blow the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following them,   <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and the armed men going before the priests who blow the trumpets, and the great multitude following the ark, while they continually blow the trumpets.   <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Joshua also commanded the people saying, You shall not shout the battle-cry, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word go out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ’Shout the battle-cry;’ then you shall shout.   <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So he caused the ark of Jehovah to march around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.   <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And Joshua rose early in the morning, so the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.   <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah kept going while they blew the trumpets, the armed men going before them and the rearguard following the ark of Jehovah, blowing trumpets   <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.   <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and when they had made the circuit of the city after the same manner, seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.   <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And it came to pass at the seventh time, that the priests blew the trumpets; Joshua said to the people, Shout the battle-cry; for Jehovah bath given you the city.   <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And the city shall be completely devoted to Jehovah, together with all that is in it; only Rahab the harlot shall live, both she and those who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.   <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Only keep yourselves from that which has been placed under the ban, lest when you have placed it under the ban you take of it, and so bring the camp of Israel under the ban, and trouble it.   <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron are holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.   <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So the people shouted the battle-cry, and went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. And when they blew the trumpets, it came to pass, as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down of itself .   <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then they completely destroyed by the sword all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass.   <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out from there the woman all that she has, as you took oath to her.   <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So the young men, the spies. went in and brought Rahab with her father and mother and kinsmen and all that she had. Even all the members of her family they brought out; and they put them in a place of security outside of the camp of Israel.   <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.   <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all that she had, Joshua saved; and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel even until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.   <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  At that time Joshua made them subscribe to this oath: Cursed be that man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city: With the loss of his first-born shall he lay its foundation, And with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.   <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.  

<p class="c-num">[Joshua 7]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But the Israelites broke faith in that which had been placed under the ban; for Achan, the son of Carmi. the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which had been placed under the ban; therefore the anger of Jehovah was aroused against the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is on the east side of  Bethel, and commanded them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went and spied out Ai.   <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And when they returned to Joshua, they said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people toil up there; for they are few.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; but they fled before the men of Ai.   <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And the men of Ai smote of them, about thirty-six men. and pursued them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the people lost heart to resist and became as weak as water.   <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before Jehovah until the evening, together with the elders of Israel; and they put  dust upon their heads.   <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to bring ns to ruin! would that we had been contented and stayed beyond the Jordan!   <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  O Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel bas turned his back before his enemies!   <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Arise! why art thou lying prostrate thus?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them, indeed they have actually taken that which was placed under the ban, and have also been guilty of theft and deception; and they have even put it among their own things.   <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  That is ·why the Israelites cannot stand before their enemies, because they have fa11en under the ban. I will not be with you any more, unless ye destroy from among you that which was placed under the ban.   <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Arise, sanctify the people, and say, ’Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, "There is in the midst of thee, O Israel, that which was placed under the ban; thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away from among you that which was placed under the ban."  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes; and it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take, shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take, shall come near man by man.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And it shall be that he who is taken that which was placed under the ban shall he burnt with fire, together with all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because be has committed a shameful crime in Israel.’ So ,Joshua ’rose up early in the morning. and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites, and he brought near the family of the Zerahites, man by man; and Zabdi was taken.   <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then he brought near his household, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zcrah, of the tribe of Judah was taken.   <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then Joshua said to Achan, my son, give, now, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and render praise to him; and tell now what you have done: do not conceal it from me.   <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Achan answered Joshua and said, Truly, I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:   <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  when I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver. and a bar of gold of fifty shekels weight, I coveted them and took them, and now they are hidden in the earth in the middle of my tent with the money underneath.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent. and there it was hidden in his tent with the money underneath.   <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and all the Israelites and laid  them down before Jehovah.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then .Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan  the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep, and his tent and all that he had and brought them to the valley of Achor.   <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And Joshua said, Why have you brought trouble upon us? Jehovah shall bring trouble upon you today. So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones,   <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Hence the name of the place has been called the valley of Achor (Trouble) to this day.

<h5>Naomi and Ruth</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had remembered his people and given them food.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.” 

<p> Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has sent me adversity.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara [Note:        In Hebrew “Naomi” means “pleasant,” and “Mara” means “bitter.”  ] , for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I had plenty when I left, but the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. 

<p class="c-num">[Ruth 2]</p>

<h5>In the Fields of Boaz</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.” 

<p> “Go, my daughter,” she replied. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be with you,” they answered him, “May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  bless you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!” 

<p> So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man with whom I worked today,” she said, “is Boaz.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law. 

<p class="c-num">[Ruth 3]</p>

<h5>Night and morning</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “I will do as you say.” Ruth said to her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Who are you?” he said. “I am Ruth your servant,” she answered, “Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He said, “May you be blest by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , my daughter. You have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognize her, for Boaz said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He also said, “Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.” So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “Is it you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “He gave me these six measures of barley,” she said, “for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  “Wait quietly, my daughter.” Naomi said, “Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.” 

<p class="c-num">[Ruth 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, “Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.” So he stopped and sat down.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then he said to the near relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.” 

<p> “I will buy it,” he said. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,” the near relative said. “You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So when the near relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” Boaz drew off the man’s sandal. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  From the children whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  gave to her a son.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.

<h1>The First Book of Samuel</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 1]</p>

<h3>Samuel</h3>

<h5>Samuel’s Birth</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  there.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  but to Hannah he used to give a double portion because he loved her. But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had shut up her womb.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had shut up her womb.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  This happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh, and stood before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and wept bitterly.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  She vowed a vow, saying, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “O  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of armies! 

<p class="indent-1"> If you will indeed look on the affliction of your maid-servant, 

<p class="indent-1"> remember me and not forget your maid-servant, 

<p class="indent-1"> but will give to your maid-servant a boy 

<p class="indent-1"> then I will give him to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  all the days of his life. 

<p class="indent-1"> A razor will not come upon his head.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  While she continued praying before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , Eli observed her mouth.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So Eli said to her, “How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “No, my lord,” Hannah answered, “I am an unfortunate woman! I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my heart before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  She said, “Let your maid-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  remembered her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and named him Samuel [Note:        Heb: Asked of God  ] , saying, “For I have asked him of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  the yearly sacrifice and his vow.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he will appear in the presence of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and will live there forever.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  establish your word.” 

<p> So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in Shiloh.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  She said, “Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has granted me my petition which I asked of him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Now, I on my part have given him to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ; as long as he lives he is given to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .” So she left him there before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  And Hannah prayed: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> My heart exults in the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , 

<p class="indent-1"> my strength is exalted in the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ;

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in the presence of Eli the priest.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in Shiloh.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, “Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Should the man, however, say to him, “First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,” he would reply, “No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The sin of the young men was very great before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for the men had contempt for the offering of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And Samuel continued ministering before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  – a lad girded with a linen ephod.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .” Then they would return to their own home.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew up before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Now Eli was very old; and whenver he heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  he said to them, “Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  spreading abroad.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , who could act as mediator for him?” Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  desired to slay them.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and of men. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  There came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “This is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s message: I revealed myself to your father’s house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh’s house,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to your father’s house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Why do you look with envious eyes on my sacrifices and offerings, and honor your sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?’  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Therefore the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel says, ‘I had indeed thought that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever,’ but now the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  says, ‘Far be it from me, for them who honor me I will honor, and they who despise me will be lightly esteemed.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  You will look in affliction and enviously on all the prosperity which I will give Israel, and there will not be an old man in your house forever.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The only one of you whom I do not cut off from my altar will be spared to weep out his eyes and to wear out his body, and all of your household will die by the sword of men.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  This will be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both will die.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire, and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before my anointed forever.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Anyone who is left in your house will come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and will beg to be given in one of the priests’ offices so that they may eat a morsel of bread.’” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The child Samuel continued ministering before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in the presence of Eli. The word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was rare in those days; there were no frequent visions.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel place – his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see –  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  where the ark of God was,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  called, “Samuel! Samuel!” He said, “Here I am.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he said, “I didn’t call, lie down again.” So he went and lay down.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  called yet again, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” But he answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now Samuel did not yet know the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  neither had the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  yet been revealed to him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So when the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” Then Eli realized that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was calling the child.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, ‘Speak,  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for your servant is listening.”’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came, and stood there, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant is listening.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the ears of everyone who hears it will ring.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli’s house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Samuel lay there until the morning. Then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Samuel was afraid to make the known the vision to Eli.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “I am here.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He said, “What is the thing that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has spoken to you? Hide nothing from me. May God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So Samuel told him everything; and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ; let him do what seems good to him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And Samuel grew, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  again appeared in Shiloh, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  revealed himself to Samuel, 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  and the word of Samuel came to all Israel. 

<h5>Samuel the judge</h5>

<p> Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So they sent to Shiloh; and took from there the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When the ark of God the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to the camp, all Israel shouted such a great shout that the earth rang. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does this great shouting in the Hebrew’s camp mean?” When they learned that the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had come to the camp,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  they were afraid, and said, “These are their gods. They have come to them to the camp.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Woe to Woe to us! Nothin like this has happened to us before! Who can deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague and pesilence.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, so that you will not become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and each fled to his home. There fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  A Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, “What is this tumultuous noise?” The man came quickly and told Eli.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see).  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle, for I fled today from the ranks.” He said, “How went the matter, my son?”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He that brought the tidings answered, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and near her time. When she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and crouched down and gave birth to a child.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  As she lay dying, the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she neither answered nor heeded.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory is taken away from Israel,” meaning the capture of the ark of God, and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “Glory has left Israel,” she said, “because the ark of God is taken.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then the Philistines took the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When the Ashdodites arose early the next day, there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . They raised up Dagon and set him in his place again.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . The head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but step over it.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The hand of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its borders.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was against the city – there was a very great panic – and he struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tomors broke out on them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, let it go back to its own place and not kill us and our people.” For a deadly panic had seized the entire city. The hand of God was very heavy there.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, and said, “What should we do with the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ? Show us how we should send it to its place.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty. You must return to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then they were asked, “What should the guilt offering be which we should return to him?” and they said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden rats, corresponding to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your lords.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Therefore you should make images of your tumors, and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you should give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from on you and your gods and your land.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Why be stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh were stubborn? Remember how he made sport of them until they let Israel go? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows which have never been yoked, and fasten the cows to the cart. But leave their calves behind them at home.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Take the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a guilt offering in a box at its side. Then send it on its way.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Watch; if it goes on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it was the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was did us this great harm, but if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that stuck us but it was an accident that happened to us.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The men did all this. They took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They placed the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  on the cart, and the box with the golden rats and the images of their tumors.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The cows took a straight course in the direction of Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn left nor right. The lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. They lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, it stood still there, near a great stone. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The Levites took down the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  on that day burnt offerings and ordinary sacrifices.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> : one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The golden rats correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. A witness is the great stone, by which they set down the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The descendents of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Beth-shemesh, when they welcomed the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . So he killed seventy of them, and the people mourned because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had struck the people with such a great slaughter.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The people of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , this holy God? To whom can we send him to be rid of him?”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Come and take it back with you.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So the people of Kiriath-jearim came, and took the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Many years passed from the time the ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim – twenty years. All the nation of Israel turned to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are returning to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you and direct your hearts towards the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and serve him alone, so that he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So the Israelites put away the Baals and the Astartes, and served the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  only.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and fasted all day and confessed, “We have sinned against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .” And Samuel judged the Israelites in Mizpah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines marched against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and said to Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  our God for us, so that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and cried to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  on behalf of Israel, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  answered him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  While Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  thundered with a mighty voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them until they were below Beth-car. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer, saying, “This is how far the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has helped us.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was against the Philistines as long as Samuel lived.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel recovered their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  He used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he used to judge Israel in all those places.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But he always returned to Ramah, for there was his home, and there he judged Israel. There he built an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .

<h3>Samuel and Saul</h3>

<h5>Development of Monarchy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons judges over Israel.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The eldest was called Joel, and his second was called Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  However his sons did not follow his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and they said to him, “You have become old and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint for us a king to rule us like all the other nations.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people and all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Listen to what they have to say, but solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who will reign over them.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Samuel told all the words of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to the people who were asking him to appoint a king.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He said, “This will be the way of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and cavalry. They will run before his chariots,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the equipment for his chariots.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  He will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He will take a tenth of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and your donkeys, and use them for his work.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his slaves.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then you will cry out in that day against your king whom you chose for yourselves, but the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will not answer you in that day.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, “No, we must have a king over us,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  so that we will like all other the nations, and so that our king can rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and make them a king.” And Samuel said to the people of Israel, “Each of your return to your city.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was. He was a head taller than any of the people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had strayed. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the servants with you and go out and find the donkeys.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. They passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, or my father will stop thinking of the donkeys and become anxious for us.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But the servant answered, “There is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honor. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now, and perhaps he can give us information about the mission on which we are going.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Saul said to the boy, “But, suppose we go, what should we take to the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What do we have?”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The servant answered Saul again, “See I have with me a quarter shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God so that he may give us information regarding our mission.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  (Formerly in Israel, when someone went to inquire of God, they said, “Come let us go to the seer;” because what is nowadays called a prophet was previously called a seer).  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Saul said to his servant, “Your advice is good. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met some young girls going out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They answered, “Yes, he is there ahead of you. Hurry, he has come today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he is needed to bless the sacrifice before the guests eat. Now go up, and at this time you will meet him.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Now the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation:  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “At this time tomorrow I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin and you must anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, because I have seen the suffering of my people, and their cry has reached me.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When Samuel saw Saul, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  indicated to him, “This is the man of whom I spoke to you! He is the one who will rule over my people.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you will eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them. They have been found. To whom does all that is desirable in Israel belong? Does it not belong to you, and to your ancestral house?  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Saul answered, “But I am a Benjamite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin! Why do you speak like this to me?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons).  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And he said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, “See, the meat is served! Eat! It was kept for you until the appointed time, so that you might eat with those whom I have invited.” 

<p> So Saul ate with Samuel that day.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down for the night.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  At daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, so that I can send you on your way.” So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell your servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay here so that I can make known to you the word of God.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 10]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has anointed you to be a ruler over his people Israel. You will reign over the people of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and save them from the power of their enemies all around. This will be the sign that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has anointed you to be a ruler over his heritage:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  when you go from me today you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the donkeys and is anxious for you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then you will go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor. There three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you will take from their hand.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  After that you will come to Gibeah-elohim, where the garrison of the Philistines is. When you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them, and they will be prophesying.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The spirit of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When these signs come to you, you will do as the occasion offers, for God is with you.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  You must go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As Saul turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him a change of heart, and all those signs came to pass that day.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  On his way to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the spirit of God possessed him, and he prophesied among them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When everyone who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  One of the bystanders answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” He said, “To find the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us that the donkeys were found.” But about the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Samuel called the people together to Mizpah,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and said to the Israelites, “This is what the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel says: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But today you rejected your God, who has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No! You must set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  by your tribes and by your clans.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was picked by lot.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their clans, and the clan of the Matrites was picked by lot. He brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was picked, but when they searched for him, him he could not be found.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So they asked of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  further, “Did the man come here?” And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  answered “See, he has hid himself among the baggage.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Someone ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people by a head.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Said Samuel to the people, “Have you seen this man whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people.” All the people shouted loudly, “Long live the king!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  In this way Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to their home.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and with him went the warriors whose hearts God had touched.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But there were some scoundrels who said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no presents. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 11]</p>

<h5>Saul the king</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About a month later Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make terms with us and we will serve you.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition will I make terms with you: that I gouge out the right eye of each of you and by this bring disgrace on all Israel.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days respite, so that we can send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be no one to save us we will surrender to you.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Saul was just coming from the field, driving the oxen. He said, “What is the trouble with the people? Why are they weeping?” Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The spirit of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen!” Then a terror from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He mustered them in Bezek. The Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They said to the messengers who came, “Say this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance will have come to you.” So the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh. They rejoiced,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you please.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  On the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions. They came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and massacred the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. The survivors scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Saul will not reign over us?’ Bring the men that we may put them to death!”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But Saul said, “Today no one will be put to death, because today the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has brought deliverance to Israel.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  All the people went to Gilgal. There they made Saul king before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in Gilgal, and sacrificed peace offerings before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and there Saul and all the men of Israel held a great celebration. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Samuel said to all Israel, “See, I have listened to you in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  From now on, behold the king who will lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth to this day.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Here I am! Testify against me before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and before his annointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I oppressed? Whom have I defrauded? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to turn a blind eye? Testify and I will restore it to you.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They said, “You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So he said to them, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” They said, “He is witness.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Samuel said to the people, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now therefore take your stand so that I may declare to you before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  all the righteous acts of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , which he did to you and to your ancestors.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Jacob came to Egypt, and your ancestors cried to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors out of Egypt, and settled them in this place.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But they forgot the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of King Jabin of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab. They fought against them,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and cried to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and said, “We have sinned because we have forsaken the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and served the Baals and the Astartes. Deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samson, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies surrounding you so that you lived in safety.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king must reign over us,’ although the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God was your king.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has now set a king over you.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If you will fear the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and both you and the king who reigns over you follow the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God, then it will be well.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But if you will not listen to the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , but rebel against the commandment of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , then will the hand of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be against you and your king.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is about to do before your eyes.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to send thunder and rain. You will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in asking for a king.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So Samuel called upon the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent thunder and rain that day. All the people were greatly afraid of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and Samuel. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then all the people said to Samuel, “Intercede with the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God in behalf of your servants so that we do not die, because we have added to all our sins the crime of asking for a king.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, you have indeed done all this evil, but do not turn aside from following the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Serve the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  with all your heart,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and do not turn aside after useless things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are useless.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  because of his great name will not cast away his people, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has undertaken to make you his own people.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Only fear the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see the great things he has done for you.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king will be swept away. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 13]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Saul was … years old when he began to reign, and he reigned … and two years over Israel. [Note:        The numbers are missing from the text.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent to their homes.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the news reached the Philistines that the Hebrews were in revolt. But Saul had in the meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and all Israel heard the news that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. The people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel – thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and fighters as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When the Israelites saw that they were in a strait (for the fighters were hard pressed), they hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.” He offered the burnt-offering.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Samuel came, and Saul went out to greet him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down to me at Gilgal, and I will not have appeased the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt-offering.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God, which he commanded you, then would the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  have established your kingdom over Israel forever.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But now your kingdom will not continue. The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has sought out a man after his own heart, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has appointed him a leader over his people, because you have not kept that which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  commanded you.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then Samuel arose and left Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul, going from Gilgal towards Gibeah of Benjamin. 

<p> Saul counted the people who were with him, about six hundred men.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Raiding parties came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and another division turned in the direction of Beth-horon, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “The Hebrews must not make swords or spears,”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  so all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his sickle and his ax and his mattock.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The charge was two thirds of a shekel for ploughshares and mattocks, and one third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and setting the ox goads.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So on the day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash, 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 14]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  and one day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come – let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree at Mignon, and with him were about six hundred men.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  One crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  from saving by many or by few.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  His armor-bearer said to him, “Do whatever your judgement dictates. I am with you, your wish is mine.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Jonathan said, “We will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If they say to us, ‘Stand still until we can reach you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign to us.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us so that we can tell you something.” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has given them into the hand of Israel.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer kept despatching them after him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In the first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer slew about twenty men in an area of about half an acre.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and even the raiders trembled and the earth quaked so that it produced a great panic. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw the army surging hither and thither.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Saul said to the people who were with him, “Investigate now and see who is gone from us.” When they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here,” for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  While Saul was speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. So Saul said to the priest, “Draw back your hand.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle, and every man’s sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The Hebrews who had gone over to the Philistines and joined their the camp, turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Likewise all the Israelites who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, pursued close after them in the battle.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  saved Israel that day, and the battle passed on beyond Beth-aven. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now there was honeycomb in that country,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people. He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then one of the fighters spoke up, “Your father charged the people saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’ So the men are exhausted.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then said Jonathan, “My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  If only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But they struck at the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint,  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and they rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When Saul was told that the people were sinning against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, “Treason! Roll a great stone to me.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  And Saul said, “Go out among the people and say to them, ‘Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in eating the flesh together with the blood.’” All the people brought their oxen that night and slew them there.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  So Saul built an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . That was the first altar that he built to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder among them until daybreak, and let us not spare a single man.” They said, “Do whatever you think best,” but the priest said, “Let us first consut God.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  So Saul asked of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But there was no answer that day.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  And Saul said, “Come here, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt today.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  For as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, who delivered Israel, even if it be in Jonathan my son, that man will surely die.” But no one of all the people answered him.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Then he said to all Israel, “You will on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Therefore Saul asked the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant this day? If the guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of Israel, give Urim, but if the guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And the lot indicated Jonathan and Saul, and the people were cleared.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  And Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  indicates, must die.” The people said to Saul, “It must not be so!” But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was indicated. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, saying, “I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand, and here I am! I am ready to die.”  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  And Saul said, “May God do to me whatever he pleases, you must surely die, Jonathan!”  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  But the people said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Then Saul broke off from pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own country. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned he was victorious.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  He did mighty deeds and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal.  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son Saul’s uncle Ner.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  The war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would take him into his service. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 15]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Samuel said to Saul, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now listen to the words of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of armies: ‘I have determined to punish the Amalekites for wha they did to Israel, in opposing them as they came up out of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have. Spare no one but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Saul said to the Kenites, “Go away, withdraw from among the Amalekites, or I will destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Saul and his army spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fat beasts, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them. But everything that was worthless and despised they completely destroyed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Samuel saying,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “I repent of making Saul king, because he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands.” And Samuel was angry and cried to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  all night.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, “Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument to himself and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “Blessed be you of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ! I have fulfilled the command of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best off the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God, and the rest we have completely destroyed.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then Samuel said to “Saul, Stop! and let me tell you what the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has said to me this night.” He said to him, “Speak.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  anointed you king over Israel,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent you on an expedition and said, ‘Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Why then did you not obey the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ?”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and have gone on the expedition which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sent me on and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban, to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God in Gilgal.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And Samuel said, “Does the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , he has rejected you from being king.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has rejected you from being king over Israel.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then Samuel said to him, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has today torn the kingdom of Israel from you and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Moreover the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a mortal that he should change his mind.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then Saul said, “I have sinned, yet honor me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, so that I may worship the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God.”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him trembling and said, “Surely death is bitter.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Samuel said, “As your sword has bereaved women, so will your mother be the most bereaved of women.” Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in Gilgal. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 16]</p>

<h3>Saul, Jonathan, and David</h3>

<h5>David at the court of Saul</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king among his sons.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And Samuel said, “How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me?” But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “Take a calf with you and say you have come to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do, and anoint the man whom I name.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Samuel did that which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He said “Yes, I have come to sacrifice to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . Purify yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sacrifice.” He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When they came and he saw Eliab, he said, “Surely the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s annointed is now in presence.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Samuel, “Pay no attention to his appearance or to the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  does not see as humans see, for they look on the outward appearance, but the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  looks at the heart.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, “Neither has the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  chosen this one.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  chosen this one.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has not chosen these.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all your sons?” He said, “There is still the youngest, but he is a shepherd with the flock.” So Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So he sent and brought him in. Now he was handsome, a youth with beautiful eyes and ruddy cheeks. And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “Get up, anoint him, for this is the man.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The spirit of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now the spirit of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  tormented him.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Command your servants who are before and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he will play with his hand, and you will be better.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a good fighter, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is with him.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the flock.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Jesse took ten loaves of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul with David his son.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  So David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul loved him so much that he became one of his armor-bearers,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  and sent a message to Jesse, saying, “Let David enter my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 17]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war. They were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle-array against the Philistines.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  A champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath of Gath and he was over nine feet in height.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was clad with a bronze breastplate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds. His shield-bearer went before him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul’s servants? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The Philistine said, “I have insulted the ranks of Israel today! Give me a man that we may fight together.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. The man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war. Their names were Eliab, the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  David was the youngest. The three eldest had followed Saul,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  while David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand for forty days.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  One day Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand and look after your brothers’ welfare and bring back some token of assurance from them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the welfare of his brothers.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before, and David heard them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “Have you seen this man who has come up?” they said, “Surely he has come up to insult Israel. Whoever kills him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter and will make his father’s house free in Israel.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, “What should be done for the man who strikes that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God?”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The people answered him in the words just given, “This is what will be done to the man who kills him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart. You have come down to see the battle.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  David said, “What have I done now? It was only a question.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Turning away from him to another, he spoke as before, and the people answered him again as at the first time. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They took him and brought him before Saul.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  David said to Saul, “Let not my lord’s courage fail him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Saul answered, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him. You are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But David said to Saul, “Your servant was a shepherd with his father’s flock, and when a lion or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  I would go out after him and kill him and rescue the lamb from his mouth. If he rose up against me, I would seize him by his jaw and slay him with a blow.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Your servant has killed both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be with you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Saul clothed David with his armor, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these because I am not used to them. And he took them off.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  He took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  The Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  When the Philistine looked and saw David, he had nothing but disdain for him, because he was only a youth with ruddy cheeks, a young man of attractive appearance.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog that you come to me with a stick?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  and said, “Come to me so that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Then David answered the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of armies, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Today the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will deliver you into my hands, that I may strike you and cut off your head. I will this day give the dead of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel,  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  so that all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear does the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  save, for the battle is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s and he will give you into our hand.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and struck down the Philistine, killing him, although there was no sword in David’s hand.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, drawing it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. 

<p> When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  The men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron.  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp,  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armor in his tent. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this lad?” And Abner said, “As you live, O king, I cannot tell.”  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is.”  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand.  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, my lad?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 18]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now when David had finished speaking with Saul, the lives of Jonathan and David became bound together, and Jonathon loved him as his own life,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and so Saul took David that day and would not let him return to his father’s house.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own life.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And David went out. On every task which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul appointed him over the warriors. He was beloved alike by all the people and by the servants of Saul. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  At the return home of the army and David’s return from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The women sang to each other as they danced, “Saul has slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It made Saul very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The next day an evil spirit from God came powerfully on Saul, and he prophesied within his house. David played the lyre to him, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and cast it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But twice David dodged it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Saul was afraid of David, because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with him and had departed from Saul.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander over a thousand. David went out and came in at the head of his men,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and he acted wisely and prospered in all his ways, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with him.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When Saul saw that David acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at the head of the army. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Saul said to David, “See my oldest daughter, Merab. I will give her to you as wife, only be a valiant champion and fight the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s battles.” For Saul said to himself, “I must not raise my hand against him, but let the hand of the Philistines deal with him.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And David replied to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my father’s clan in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But when the time came that Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given as wife to Adriel the Meholathite. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Michal, Saul’s daughter, fell in love with David. When they told Saul, he was pleased.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He thought, “I will give her to him, so that she becomes a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You will this day be my son-in-law.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly and tell him that the king is pleased with him and all the servants love him, therefore become the king’s son-in-law.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And Saul’s servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, “Is it an easy thing in your opinion to become the king’s son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation?”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The servants of Saul reported back what David had said.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And Saul said, “Tell David: The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.” Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king’s son-in-law. Before the appointed time,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  he arose and went together with his men and slew a hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and gave them in full to the king, in order to become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When Saul saw and knew that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was with David and his daughter Michal loved him,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Saul feared David still more, and from that time was David’s enemy. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The Philistine commanders continued to come out to battle, and as often as they came out, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 19]</p>

<h5>David flees Saul</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, was very fond of David,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and told David, “Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now, I beg you, take care in the morning and stay in concealment and hide yourself.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover I will tell you.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and gave an oath, “As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, David will not be put to death.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as before. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then an evil spirit from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, so that Saul hurled the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  That night Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat’s hair for its head and covered it with the garment.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat’s hair for its pillow.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me: Let me go, why should I kill you?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When Saul was told thqt David was there at Naioth in Ramah,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  he sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophesied.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then Saul himself went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern in Secu, he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” Someone answered, “They are at Naioth in Ramah.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But on his journey to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He too stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 20]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin against your father, that he is seeking my life?”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He replied to him, “Far from it! You will not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me? It can’t be true!”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  David answered, “Your father well knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, ‘Let not Jonathan know this or he will be pained.’ Nevertheless as surely as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then Jonathan said to David, “What do you want me to do for you?”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And David answered Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king. Therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  If your father misses me, then say, ‘David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If he says ‘Good,’ then it is well with your servant, but if it arouses his anger, then know that he intends evil on me.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. If there is guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Jonathan said, “No! For if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, if your father answers you harshly?”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And Jonathan replied to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And Jonathan said to David, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time tomorrow or the next day, and if is well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  May God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  be with you, as he has been with my father.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If I am yet alive, show me the kindness of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ! But if I should die,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  continue your kindness to my household forever, even if the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  seek out the enemies of David.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Jonathan took an oath again with David, because of his love to him. With all his heart he loved him.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  On the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you should go to the place where you hid yourself the other time, and sit down there beside the heap of stones.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I will shoot three arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are on this side of you, pick them up!’ – then come; for it is safe for you, and, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, there is no danger.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But if I say to the boy, ‘See, the arrows are beyond you,’, go, for then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  sends you away.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  As to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is witness between you and me forever. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  The king sat upon his seat as usual, on the seat by the wall, with Jonathan opposite, and Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, ‘It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed.’  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But when on the day following the new moon, David’s place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And Jonathan answered Saul, “David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  for he said, ‘Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away and see my brothers.’ Hence he has not come to the king’s table.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>   Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “Son of a depraved woman! Don’t I know that you are associated with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then Jonathan answered Saul his father “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But Saul lifted up his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  He said to his boy, “Run, find and the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  When the boy came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Jonathan cried after the boy, “Hurry, quick, do not stop!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  But the boy had no knowledge of anything. Only Jonathan and David understood what this meant.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  – the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.” Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 21]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone and no one with you?”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  David answered Ahimelech the priest, “The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you.’ I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or whatever can be found, give it to me.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread at hand. There is holy bread, but only if the young men have kept themselves from women.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  David answered the priest, “Women have been kept from us, as always when I set out on an expedition. The weapons of the young men were consecrated even on an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their weapons be holy!”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presense, that was taken from before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  (Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul’s herdsmen.)  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  David said to Ahimelech, “Have you not here at hand a spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter required haste.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.” And David said, “There is none like that, give it to me.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then David rose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Was it not of him that they used to sing to each other in the dances, saying, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Saul has slain his thousands, 

<p class="indent-1"> But David his ten thousands?” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  David took these words to his heart and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  He pretended to be insane before them, and raved in their hands and drummed on the doors and let his spittle run down his beard.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Achish said to his servants, “You see plainly that the man is mad; why do you bring him to me?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act the madman in my presence? Should this one come into my house?” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 22]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s clan heard of it, they went down there to him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Let my father and my mother shelter with you, until I know what God will do for me.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He left them in the presences of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold. Depart and go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered, he was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, “Listen Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Is that why all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity on me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me, as is now the case?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He inquired of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub!” He answered, “Here am I, my lord!”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me with the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case?”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Ahimelech answered the king, “But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king’s son-in-law and captain over your retainers and honored in your household?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The king said to the runners who stood before him, “Turn about and slay the priests of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then the king said to Doeg, “Turn and strike down the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore the ephod.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine. You will be safe with me.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 23]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  David was told that Philistines were fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  David inquired of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to David, “Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But David’s men said to him, “Behold we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then David inquired of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  yet again. And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  answered him, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle, inflicting heavy losses on them. In this way David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has sold him into my hand, for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring here the ephod.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And David said, “ <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.” And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “He will come down.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “They will deliver you up.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and moving from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hill-country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him continually, but the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  did not deliver him into his hand. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. At that time, he was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And Jonathan, Saul’s son, came to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He said to him, “Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you. This Saul my father well knows.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The two of them made a covenant before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and David stayed in Horesha, and Jonathan returned home. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of Jeshimon?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart’s desire, come down, and it will be our part to deliver him into the king’s hand.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Saul said, “Blessed may you be of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for you have had compassion on me.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is very cunning.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When Saul and his men went to seek him, David found out and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard, he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  when a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. This is why they call that place the Rock of Divisions.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  David went up from there, and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 24]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Wilderness of En-gedi.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats’ Crags.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave. And Saul went in to relieve himself, while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The men of David said to him, “See this is the day of which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to you, ‘Behold, I give your enemy into your hand and you will do to him as you please.’” Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But afterward David was seized with remorse because he had cut off Saul’s robe.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He said to his men, “The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed, to lift my hand against him, since he is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So David upbraided his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. When Saul rose from the cave and went on his way,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  David also rose after him and went from the cave and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king.” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the earth, and did obeisance.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And David said to Saul, “Why did you listen to the words of the men who said, ‘See, David seeks to harm you?’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Today your eyes see that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  gave you into my hand in the cave, but I refused to kill you and had pity on you, and I said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Moreover, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor guilt on my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are aiming to take my life.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  judge between me and you, but my hand will not be against you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  As runs the proverb of the ancients, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> But my hand will not be raised against you.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  therefore be judge and decide between me and you and see and plead my cause and obtain justice for me from you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this not your voice, my son David?” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  You have done great good to me in that today, when the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound? Therefore may the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  reward you richly for what you have done to me this day.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now see, I know that you will surely be king, and that through you the kingdom of Israel will be established.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Swear now therefore to me by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So David took oath to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 25]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. 

<p> Then David arose and went into the Wilderness of Maon.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. The woman was sensible and beautiful, but the man was rough and ill-mannered. He was a Calebite.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So he sent ten young men, saying, “Go up to Carmel and enter Nabal’s house and greet him in my name,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and say to him and to his clan, ‘Peace be to you and your house and all that you have.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not jeer at them, and nothing of theirs was missing all the while they were in Carmel.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a feast day. Give, therefore, whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David and waited as directed.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Many are the slaves these days who break away, each from his master!  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Should I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not where they came from?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So David’s young men turned back on their way, and came and reported all these words to him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And David said to his men, “Let every man buckle on his sword.” Each man buckled on his sword. And David also buckeled on his sword, and there went up after David about four hundred men while two hundred remained with the baggage. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But one of the young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David has just sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But the men have been very good to us and we have not been jeered at nor have we missed anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They were a wall about us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a base scoundrel that no one speak to him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five roasted sheep and five mesures of parched grain and a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on donkeys.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  She said to her young men, “Go on before me, I am coming after you.” But she said nothing about it to her husband Nabal.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Just as she was riding on the donkey and coming down under cover of the mountain, David and his men were also coming down toward her, so that she met them.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now David had said, “Surely for nothing did I guard all that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness, so that nothing of all that belongs to him was missing, for he has returned me evil for good.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  God do whatever he will to David, if I leave by daybreak of all who belong to him as much as a single man.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When Abigail saw David, she alighted quickly from her donkey and fell on her face before David and bowed to the ground.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me, my lord, upon me be the guilt. Only let your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your servant.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Let not my lord pay any attention to that base scoundrel, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he, ‘Reckless Fool,’ is his name and folly is his master, but your maid-servant didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Now my lord, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives and as you live, since the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has kept you from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering yourself by your own hand – and may your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal –  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  let this present, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Forgive, I pray the trespass of your servant, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will certainly make for my lord a secure house, for my lord is fighting the wars of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and no evil will be found in you as long as you live.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Should a man rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God, but the lives of your enemies will he sling out as from the hollow of a sling.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has done to my lord all the good that he has promised you and has made you prince over Israel,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  then this will not be a qualm or a burden on the conscience of my lord, that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has delivered himself by his own hand. When the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  gives prosperity to my lord, then remember your servant.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you yourself, who have kept me this day from committing an act of bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  For as sure as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from doing you harm, except you had quickly come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by daybreak so much as one man.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and to her he said, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your advice, and granted your request.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk, so that she did not tell him anything at all until day break.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But then in the morning when the effects of the wine were gone from Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him and he became a stone.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  At the end of about ten days the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  struck Nabal, so that he died. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Now when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who has avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil. The evil-doing of Nabal the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  brought back upon his own head.” Then David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife,”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  She rose and bowed with her face to the earth and said, “See, your slave is willing to be a servant to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Abigail quickly arose and mounted an donkey, and five maids followed as servants. So she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 26]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “David is hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Accordingly Saul arose, and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand men of Israel, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Saul encamped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah overlooking Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come there after him,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  so he arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul lay within the barricade, and the people were encamped around about him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So David and Abishai went to the army by night. Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to strike him twice!”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lay his hand upon the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed and be innocent?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  David said, “As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, either the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and be destroyed.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  forbid that I should lift my hand against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed, but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul’s head and they departed. No man saw it of knew it neither did any awake, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  had fallen upon them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And David cried to the army and to Abner, the son of Ner, “Do you make no answer Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you that calls to the king?”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This that you have done is not good. As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  He said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty?  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it was men, cursed be they before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , saying, ‘Go serve other gods.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away from the presence of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Saul said, “I have done wrong. Return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And David answered, “There is the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will reward each man’s righteousness and fidelity, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’a anointed.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Saul said to David, “Be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and will surely succeed!” So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 27]</p>

<h5>David among the Philistines</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then David said to himself, “I will be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So David set out, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  David stayed with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  David Said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let a place in one of the towns in the open country be given me, that I may live there, for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Achish gave him Ziklag at that time, therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The length of the time that David lived in the open country of the Philistines was a year and four months. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these tribes live in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As often as David struck the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” David answered, “Against the Negreb of Judah”, or “against the Negreb of the Jerahmeelites”, or “against the Negreb of the Kenites.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, “They might give information against us and say, ‘David has done this, or that.’” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the open country of the Philistines.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has brought himself into ill odor with his people Israel, therefore he will be my servant forever.” 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 28]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now in those days the Philistines assembled their forces to make a campaign against Israel. Achish said to David, “You know thqt you must, together with your men,  go with me along with the forces.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  David said to Achish, “Good, you will now know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “I will make you my bodyguard from this time on.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had banished the mediums and magicians out of the land.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When the Philistines assembled and came and encamped in Shunem, Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart was filled with apprehension.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Saul inquired of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , but the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire through her.” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at Endor.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, taking two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. He said, “Tell my future by consulting the dead, call up for me the one whom I name to you.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The woman said to him, Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has banished the mediums and the magicians from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to put me to death?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And Saul swore to her by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , saying, “As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, no guilt will come upon you for this.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then the woman said, “Whom should I bring up to you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. The woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the earth in respect. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am in great trouble, for the Philistines are making war against me and God has turned from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have called you to tell me what I should do.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And Samuel said, “Why do you ask of me when the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has turned from you and become your adversary?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has done to you as he declared by me, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Because you did not heed the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has done this thing to you today.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will deliver Israel into the power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will deliver the army of Israel into the power of the Philistines.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then Saul fell at once at full length upon the earth and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel, and he had no strength in him, for he had not eaten bread during all the day and all the night.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, “Your servant has heeded your voice, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Now therefore, listen also to the advice of your servant and let me set before you a morsel of meat, and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman urged him, until he listened to their advice. So he rose from the earth and sat upon the couch.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and took flour and kneaded it and baked from it unleavened bread.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  She set it before Saul and his servants and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 29]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The Philistines had assembled their forces at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The lords of the Philistines were marching past, with hundreds and with thousands, and David and his men marched in the rear guard with Achish.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “This is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has now been with me two years, and I have found no fault in him from the time that he came over to me to the present.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But the commanders of the Philistines were enraged against him, and said, “Send back the man so that he may return to the place where you have stationed him. Don’t let him go down with us to battle – he might become an adversary to us. How could this fellow better ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of our men?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Is this not the David of whom they sang responsively in the dances, saying, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Saul has slain his thousands, 

<p class="indent-1"> But David his ten thousands?” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Achish called to David and said to him, “As the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  lives, you are upright, and it is my desire that you should go out and fight with me, for I have found no evil in you from the time that you came to me to the present, but you are not regarded favorably by the lords.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore now return and go in peace, so that you do nothing to displease the lords of the Philistines.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant fromt the day that I entered into your service to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Achish answered David, “I know that you are as good in my sight as a Messenger of God, but the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Therefore now rise early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place where I have stationed you, and do not entertain any evil design in your heart, for you are good in my sight, but rise early in the morning and as soon as it is light, depart.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So David rose early, together with his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 30]</p>

<h5>David returns</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now when David and his men  on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South Country and on Ziklag, and had attacked Ziklag and burnt it down,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and had carried away captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then David and the people who were with him wept aloud until they were no longer able to weep.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  David’s two wives had been take captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  David was in great trouble, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the spirit of all the people was embittered, each for his sons and for his daughters. 

<p> David strengthened himself in reliance on the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  his God,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring here to me the ephod.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  David inquired of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , saying, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Should I pursue this marauding band? 

<p class="indent-2"> Should I overtake them?” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> He answered him, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Pursue, 

<p class="indent-2"> For you will surely overtake, 

<p class="indent-2"> You will surely rescue.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So David went, together with the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Wadi Besor, where those who were left behind remained.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But David pursued together with four hundred men, while two hundred remained behind, who were too faint to cross the Wadi Besor. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him food to eat and water to drink,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and they gave him a piece of fig cake, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and nights.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  David said to him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” He said “I am an Egyptian lad, an Amalekite’s servant, and my master abandoned me because three days ago I fell sick.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We made a raid upon the South Country of the Cherethites and on that which belongs to Judah and upon the South Country of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned down.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?” He said, “Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When he had brought him down, there they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, on account of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And David struck them from twilight to the following evening in order to destroy them completely. None escaped except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  David recovered all the people whom the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  There was nothing missing, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken to themselves – David brought it all back.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He took all the flocks and the herds and drove those animals before the people, and they said, “This is David’s spoil.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now when David came to the two hundred men, who had been too faint to follow him, so that he had to leave them behind at the Wadi Besor, they went out to meet David, and the people who were with him. When they came near to the people, he saluted them.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then all the wicked and base scoundrels among the men who went with David began to say, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each, his wife and his children, that he may take them away and depart.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But David said, No! My brothers, you must not do this with that which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has given us – after he has preserved us and delivered the marauding band that came against us into our hand.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Who will give heed to you in this matter? For: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> As is the share of him who goes down into battle, 

<p class="indent-1"> So is the share of him who remains with the baggage. 

<p class="indent-1"> They must share alike.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  From that time on he made it a statute and precedent in Israel to this day. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, “See! a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  to them who were in Bethel, in Ramoth in the South Country, in Jattir,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  in Carmel, in the cities of Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  in Hormah, Bor-ashan, in Athach,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  in Hebron, and to those in all the places where David and his men had stayed. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Samuel 31]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The Philistines followed close after Saul and his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then said Saul to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, lest these uncircumcised Philistines come and make sport of me.” But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Saul and his three sons and his armorbearer died together on the same day.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the Israelites who were in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they also left the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and occupied them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When on the following day the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to bring the good news to their idols and to the people.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They put his armor in the temple of Ashtarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Beth-shan.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  all the valiant men arose and marched all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beths-han. They returned to Jabesh and burned them there.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.

<p class="c-num">[Esther 1]</p>

<h5>The Follies of a Despot</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Queen Vashit”, the king said, “has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Memucan replied before the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!’  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife!  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honor to their husbands.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house! 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 2]</p>

<h5>Choosing a Queen</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  (Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The girl pleased him and gained his favor, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favorite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honor of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up. 

<h5>Hatred without Pity</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had ‘pur’ (which means ‘lot’) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “The money is yours,” the king said to Haman, “and the people also to do with them as you wish.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself. 

<p> Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 4]</p>

<h5>A Queen’s Efforts to Save Her People</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behavior, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  he sent back this reply to Esther, “Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Mordecai did everything Esther had directed. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favor, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “If it seems best to the king,” Esther said, “let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the king ordered, “Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.” 

<p> So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Esther answered,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “If I have won the king’s favor and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 6]</p>

<h5>Downfall of a Conspirator</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “What honor and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?” the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied “Nothing has been done for him,”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So the king’s pages said to him, “Haman is standing there, in the court.” The king said, “Let him enter.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Haman entered, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom besides me could the king wish to honor?”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So he said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Queen Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if I have won your favor, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.” Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, “Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?” 

<p> As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman’s face  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, “There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!” The king said “Hang him on them.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 8]</p>

<h5>Deliverance of the Jews</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “If it seems best to the king,” she said, “and if I have won his favor and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands! 

<p> Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honor.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them. 

<p class="c-num">[Esther 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “If it please the king,” Esther said, “let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This was on the thirteenth day of Adar. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  (But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other. 

<h5>The Establishment of Purim</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast ‘Pur’, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="c-num">[Esther 10]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.

<h1>JOB</h1>

<h5>The Prologue</h5>

<h4>Job’s Piety and Prosperity</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 1]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the land of Uz there was a man called Job–  a man blameless and upright, who feared God and  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  shunned evil. He had a family of seven sons and  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  three daughters: and he owned seven thousand  sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke  of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a vast train of  servants, so that he was the richest man in all the  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  East. Now his sons used to hold feast day about,  and they would send and invite their three sisters  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  to eat and drink with them; and when the cycle  of feasts was over, Job used to send for them and  prepare them for worship, rising early and offering  burnt offerings for them all: for – said Job– 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Perchance my children have sinned 

<p class="indent-2"> And cursed God in their heart.  And this Job never failed to do. 

<h4>The Heavenly Council. Satan is permitted to test the Quality of Job’s Piety</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings  came to present themselves before Jehovah, and  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  among them came Satan. Then Jehovah asked  Satan where he had come from, and Satan answered  Jehovah thus, "From ranging the earth and from  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  walking up and down it." Then Jehovah said to  Satan: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> "Hast thou noted my servant Job, 

<p class="indent-2"> That on earth there is none like him– 

<p class="indent-1"> A man blameless and upright, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who fears God and shuns evil?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  To this Satan made answer: 

<p class="indent-1"> But is it for nothing that Job fears God? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Hast Thou not Thyself fenced him and his house, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all he possesses on every side? 

<p class="indent-1"> The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his substance abounds in the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But put forth Thy hand and touch all he possesses, 

<p class="indent-2"> And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: 

<p class="indent-1"> "See! all he possesses is in thy power, 

<p class="indent-2"> But lay not thy hand on the man himself." 

<p class="indent-1"> Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah. 

<h4>The Blows Fall</h4> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now on a certain day, as his sons and daughters  Were eating and drinking wine in the house of their  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  eldest brother, suddenly a messenger appeared  before Job with the tidings: 

<p class="indent-1"> "The oxen were hard at the plough; 

<p class="indent-2"> And the asses were feeding beside them, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When sabeans fell upon them and seized them; 

<p class="indent-2"> The servants they slew with the sword– 

<p class="indent-2"> Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  While he was still speaking, another came and said: 

<p class="indent-2"> "The fire of God has fallen from heaven, 

<p class="indent-2"> And burnt to a cinder the sheep and the servants– 

<p class="indent-2"> Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  While he was still speaking, another came and said: 

<p class="indent-1"> "Chaldeans, formed into three bands, 

<p class="indent-2"> Made a raid on the camels and seized them. 

<p class="indent-1"> The servants they slew with the sword– 

<p class="indent-2"> Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  While he was still speaking, another came and said: 

<p class="indent-1"> "Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking 

<p class="indent-2"> In the house of their eldest brother: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  On a sudden a mighty wind 

<p class="indent-2"> From the other side of the desert 

<p class="indent-1"> came and smote and four sides of the house, 

<p class="indent-2"> That it fell on the young folk and killed them– 

<p class="indent-2"> Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then Job rose and rent his robe; and, after shaving 

<p class="indent-1"> his head, he threw himself with these words pros- 

<p class="indent-1"> trate upon the ground: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  "Naked came I from my mother’s womb, 

<p class="indent-2"> And naked thither must I return. 

<p class="indent-1"> Jehovah hath given, Jehovah hath taken: 

<p class="indent-2"> The name of Jehovah be blessed." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  In all this Job committed no sin, nor did he charge 

<p class="indent-1"> God with unseemly dealing. 

<h4>The Second Council</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings came  to present themselves before Jehovah, and among  them came Satan to present himself before Jehovah.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from,  and satan answered Jehovah thus, "From ranging  the earth and from walking up and down it."  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Jehovah said to Satan: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> "Hast thou noted my servant Job, 

<p class="indent-2"> That on earth there is none like him– 

<p class="indent-1"> A man blameless and upright, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who fears God and shuns evil? 

<p class="indent-1"> And still he clings to his honour– 

<p class="indent-2"> In vain hast thou set me on to destroy him." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  To this Satan made answer: 

<p class="indent-2"> "Skin for skin; 

<p class="indent-2"> All a man’s goods will he give for his life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But put forth Thy hand, touch his bone and his flesh 

<p class="indent-2"> And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: 

<p class="indent-2"> "See! he is on thy power, 

<p class="indent-2"> But take heed that thou spare his life." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah. 

<h4>The Second Test</h4>

<p> And he smote Job from the sole of his foot to the  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  crown of his head with boils so grievous that he  took a potsherd to scratch with; and, as he was  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  sitting among the ashes, his wife said to him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> "Art thou clinging still to thine honour? 

<p class="indent-2"> Curse God and die." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Job said to her: 

<p class="indent-2"> "Must thou too speak 

<p class="indent-2"> As a foolish women speak? 

<p class="indent-1"> We accept from God what is good: 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall we not accept what is evil?" 

<p class="indent-1"> In all this Job was guilty of no sin of speech. 

<h4>Job’s Friends Come to Comfort Him</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When Job’s three friends heard of all the misery  that had come upon him, they travelled each man  from his own place – Eliphaz the Temabite, Bildad  the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they  had made a tyrst together to come to condole with  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  him and comfort him. But when they caught a  glimpse of him at a distance they did not recognize  him. Then every man of them wept aloud and  tore his robe and scattered dust heavenwards upon  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  his head. Then they sat down beside him upon the  ground seven days and nights, and no one said a word  to him; for they saw that his pain was very great. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Thereafter Job opened his mouth to curse his  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  day, and thus he began: 

<h5>ACT 1</h5>

<h4>Job’s Lament and Longing for Death</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Perished the day wherein I was born, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the night which announced that a man-child had come. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4a]</span>  Utter darkness let that night be, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[9b]</span>  Looking for light, but finding none. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4b]</span>  May God in the heights above ask not after it, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[4c]</span>  And may no beam shine forth upon it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  May darkness and gloom claim it for their own, 

<p class="indent-2"> And may the thick cloud rest upon it. 

<p class="indent-1"> Black vapours of the day affright it! 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And let the thick darkness snatch it away. 

<p class="indent-1"> May it not be joined to the days of the year, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or enter into the tale of the months. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As for that night, let it be barren: 

<p class="indent-2"> May there never ring through it a cry of joy. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Accursed of sorcerers be that day– 

<p class="indent-2"> Of those that are skilful to stir up Leviathan. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9a]</span>  Dark be the stars of its morning twilight, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[9c]</span>  And never the eyelids of Dawn may it see; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Since it shut not the doors of my mother’s womb, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hid not trouble from mine eyes. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Why died I not at my birth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Breathe my last as I came from the womb, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Like a hidden untimely birth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like infants that never see light? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Why on the knees was I welcomed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And why were there breasts to suck? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For then had I lain down in quiet, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then had I slept and had rest– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  With kings of the earth and with cousellors, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who built stately tombs for themselves, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Or with princes rich in gold, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who had filled their houses with silver. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  There the wicked cease their tumult, 

<p class="indent-2"> There the weary are at rest– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Prisoners at ease together, 

<p class="indent-2"> Deaf to the taskmaster’s voice. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  There the small and the great are alike, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the servants is free from his master. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Why is light given to the wretched, 

<p class="indent-2"> And life to the bitter in soul, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  To the man whose path is obscured, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who is hedged round about by God– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Such as long for death, but it comes not, 

<p class="indent-2"> And dig for it more than for treasure, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Who would joy o’er a mound of stones, 

<p class="indent-2"> And rejoice, could they find a grave? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For my bread there comes to me sighing, 

<p class="indent-2"> My groans are poured out like water. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For the evil I fear overtakes me, 

<p class="indent-2"> The things that I dread comes upon me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Scarce have I ease or quiet 

<p class="indent-2"> Or rest, when tumult cometh. 

<h4>Eliphaz’s Comfortable Exhortation and Revelation</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May we lift up a word unto thee who art fainting, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> For who has the heart to restrain his speech? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  see! thou hast instructed many, 

<p class="indent-2"> And strengthened the drooping hands. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thy words used to set up the stumbling, 

<p class="indent-2"> And strengthen the tottering knees. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But now that it comes upon thee, thou art faint; 

<p class="indent-2"> Now that it reaches thyself, thou art terrified. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Is not thy religion thy confidence, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy blameless life thy hope? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Bethink thee: has an innocent man ever perished, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or when have the just been cut off? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It is those who plough wrong and sow trouble 

<p class="indent-2"> That reap it: – for this have I seen. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  By the breath of God they perish, 

<p class="indent-2"> At the blast of HIs anger they vanish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The Lion roared, the hoarse lion thundered: 

<p class="indent-2"> But his young lion’s teeth were broken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So for lack of prey he perished, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now to me a word came stealing, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mine ear caught a whisper thereof, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In thoughts from the visions of night, 

<p class="indent-2"> When deep sleep falleth on men. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Fear came upon me and trembling, 

<p class="indent-2"> That made my bones all quake. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then a breath passed over my face, 

<p class="indent-2"> The hair of my flesh bristled up. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  There – it – stood. 

<p class="indent-2"> I could not tell what it looked like– 

<p class="indent-1"> This form before mine eyes. 

<p class="indent-2"> In the silence I heard a voice say: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  "Can mortal be just before God, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or a man clean before his Creator? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  See! He putteth no trust in His servants, 

<p class="indent-2"> His angels He chargeth with folly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  How much more those whose houses are clay, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whose very foundation is dust, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who die before the moth, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Crushed between morning and evening, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Bruised without any regarding it, 

<p class="indent-2"> Perished for evermore! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The cord of their tent is torn from them: 

<p class="indent-2"> They die – but without learning wisdom." 

<p class="c-num">[Job 5]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Call now: will any one answer? 

<p class="indent-2"> To which of the saints wilt thou turn? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For vexation killeth the fool, 

<p class="indent-2"> Indignation slayeth the simpleton. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I have seen a fool taking root, 

<p class="indent-2"> But his branch became suddenly rotten, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  His children were far from help, 

<p class="indent-2"> Crushed beyond hope deliverance. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The hungry eat up their harvest, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the thirsty draw from their wells. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For not from the dust riseth ruin, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor out of the ground springeth trouble; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But man is born unto trouble, 

<p class="indent-2"> While the sons of flame soar above it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Were it I, I would seek unto God; 

<p class="indent-2"> My cause I would bring before God, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Who doeth great things and unsearchable, 

<p class="indent-2"> Marvellous things without number, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Who bringeth rain over the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And over the fields sendeth water– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Setting the lowly on high, 

<p class="indent-2"> And lifting the mourners to safety, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Frustrating the plots of the crafty 

<p class="indent-2"> And robbing their hands of success, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So taking the wise in their guile, 

<p class="indent-2"> That their tortuous plans fail through rashness: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They feel in the day as in darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> At noontide they grope as at night. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So the needy He saves from the sword, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the poor from the hands of the mighty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thus hope is born in the weak, 

<p class="indent-2"> And iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Happy then the mortal whom God correcteth: 

<p class="indent-2"> So spurn no thou the Almighty’s chastening. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For He bindeth the wounds He hath made, 

<p class="indent-2"> And His hands heal the hurt He hath dealt. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He will save thee in six distresses, 

<p class="indent-2"> In seven no evil shall touch thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  In famine He frees thee from death, 

<p class="indent-2"> And in war from the power of the sword. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  From the scourge of tongue thou art safe; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou shalt fear not the onslaught of ruin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  At ruin and dearth shalt thou laugh, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the beasts of the field thou shalt fear not. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For the stones of the earth are thine allies, 

<p class="indent-2"> The beasts of the field are thy friends. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Thou shalt know that thy tent is secure, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou shalt visit thy fold and miss nothing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Thy seed thou shalt know to be many, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thine offspring as grass of the earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Thou shalt come to the grave in thy strength, 

<p class="indent-2"> As a sheaf cometh in its season. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  See! this we have searched – so it is. 

<p class="indent-2"> We have heard it – lay thou it to heart. 

<h4>Job’s Denunciation of Hollow Friendship. His Challenge</h4> of God and His Longing to be Gone 

<p class="c-num">[Job 6]</p>

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  O could my vexation be carefully weighed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my misery set in the balance against it! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For it is more heavy than sand of the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> And therefore it is that my words are wild. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For the arrows of God Almighty are in me, 

<p class="indent-2"> My spirit drinketh their fiery poison. 

<p class="indent-1"> The terrors of God are arrayed against me, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[7a]</span>  My soul refuseth to be at rest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Doth the wild ass bray as he nibbles the grass, 

<p class="indent-2"> And over their fodder do oxen low? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Can a man eat that which is tasteless and saltless? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is there any taste in the slime of the yolk? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  O that I might have my request, 

<p class="indent-2"> That God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  O that God would consent to crush me, 

<p class="indent-2"> To let His hand loose and cut me off! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So should I still have this for my comfort– 

<p class="indent-2"> Leaping for joy amid torture unsparing– 

<p class="indent-2"> That I had not concealed the words of the Holy One. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  What is my strength, that I should endure? 

<p class="indent-1"> Or what is mine end, that I should be patient? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Is my strength the strength of stones? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or was I created with flesh of brass? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Behold! I have no help in myself, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the power to achieve is driven from me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  To one who is fainting a friend should be kind, 

<p class="indent-2"> Even though he forsaketh the fear of Almighty 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But my brethen have dealt like a treacherous torrent, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like channels that overflow their banks, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Which are turbid because of the ice 

<p class="indent-2"> And the snow that hides within them; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But, when they are scorched, they vanish: 

<p class="indent-2"> In the heat they are quenched from their place. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The caravans bend their course thither, 

<p class="indent-2"> Go up through the waste, and perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The caravans of Tema looked out for them, 

<p class="indent-2"> The companies of Sheba kept hoping: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But their confidence brought them to shame; 

<p class="indent-2"> When they came to the place, they blushed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Such now have ye proved unto me: 

<p class="indent-2"> When ye look on the terror, ye shudder. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Did I ask you to give me a present, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or make me a gift of your substance, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  To rescue me from the foe, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or from hand of the tyrant to free me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Teach me, and I will be silent; 

<p class="indent-2"> Show me wherein I have erred. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  How sweet are words that are true! 

<p class="indent-2"> But when you reprove, what is reproved? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Is it words that ye mean to reprove? 

<p class="indent-2"> But for winds are the words of despair. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Would ye throw yourselves on the innocent, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or make an assault on your friend? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Now look upon me, I pray you: 

<p class="indent-2"> I would surely not lie in your face. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  O turn back – let there be no injustice: 

<p class="indent-2"> Turn back, for the right is still mine. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Is my tongue altogether perverted? 

<p class="indent-2"> Have I lost the sense of wrong? 

<p class="c-num">[Job 7]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Hath man on the earth not a warfare, 

<p class="indent-2"> With days like the days of a hireling? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Like a slave that pants for the shadow, 

<p class="indent-2"> A hireling that longs for his wages, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So empty months are my portion, 

<p class="indent-2"> And wearisome nights mine appointment. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I lie down, saying, "When cometh day?" 

<p class="indent-2"> When I rise, methinks, "When cometh even?" 

<p class="indent-2"> I am full of unrest till the dawn. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Worms and clods clothe my flesh; 

<p class="indent-2"> My skin grows hard and then breaks. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  My days are more swift than a shuttle; 

<p class="indent-2"> They come to an end without hope. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  O remember my life is but breath; 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine eyes shall see good nevermore. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The eye that now sees me shall see me no more; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thine eyes shall look for me, but I shall be gone. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Like the cloud that is spent and that passeth away, 

<p class="indent-2"> He that goes down to Sheol shall come up no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He shall never come back to his house again, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the place that was his shall know him no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So my mouth I will not restrain, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will utter mine anguish of spirit, 

<p class="indent-2"> Pour out mine embittered soul. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Am I a sea or a sea-monster, 

<p class="indent-2"> That upon me Thou settest a watch? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When I look to my couch to comfort me, 

<p class="indent-2"> To my bed for relief of my sorrow, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Thou scarest me with dreams, 

<p class="indent-2"> And with visions dost so affright me, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  That gladly would I be strangled: 

<p class="indent-2"> Death itself I spurn in my pain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I would not live for ever: 

<p class="indent-2"> Let me go, for my days are but breath. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  What is man, that so great Thou dost count him 

<p class="indent-2"> And settest Thine heart upon him– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Visiting him every morning, 

<p class="indent-2"> And testing him moment by moment? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O when wilt Thou turn Thine eyes from me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And leave me though but for a moment? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  If I sin, how does that harm Thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> O Thou who art Watcher of men? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why dost Thou make me Thy target? 

<p class="indent-2"> Why burden Thyself with me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Why not forgive my sin, 

<p class="indent-2"> And pass mine iniquity by? 

<p class="indent-1"> For now I shall lie in the dust; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou shalt search, but I shall not be. 

<h4>Bildad’s Appeal to the Teaching of Tradition</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 8]</p>

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  How long wilt thou utter these things– 

<p class="indent-2"> These thy blustering windy words? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Is God a perverter of justice? 

<p class="indent-2"> The Almighty subverter of right? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  If thy children, for sinning against Him, 

<p class="indent-2"> He has left to bear their transgressions, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yet seek thou thyself unto God, 

<p class="indent-2"> And supplicate the Almighty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And if thou art pure and upright, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy righteous abode He will prosper; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And, though thy beginning be slender, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thine end He shall greatly increase. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For inquire thou of past generations, 

<p class="indent-2"> Regard the search of the fathers:– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For we are but dullards of yesterday, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whose days on the earth are a shadow– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Shall they not give thee instruction, 

<p class="indent-2"> And bring forth words out of their heart? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Can the rush shoot high without swamp, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or the reed grow up without water? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  While yet in its freshness, unplucked, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of all herbs it withers most quickly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So end all who put God out of mind. 

<p class="indent-2"> And the hope of the hypocrite dies. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  His confidence is but a thread, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his trust as the web of a spider. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He leans on his house, but it stands not: 

<p class="indent-2"> He grasps, but it cannot endure. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Like a plant is he, fresh in the sunshine, 

<p class="indent-2"> With suckers that shoot o’er the garden. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Its roots are entwined round the well, 

<p class="indent-2"> It lays hold of its stone habitation, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But when it is ruined, the spot 

<p class="indent-2"> Denies having ever beheld it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Thus its course ends in desolation 

<p class="indent-2"> And out of the dust springs another." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  See! God spurns not an innocent man, 

<p class="indent-2"> But He will not uphold evildoers. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy lips with a shout of joy. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Thy foes shall be clothed with shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the tent of the wicked shall vanish. 

<h4>Job’s Challenge of Immoral Omnipotence</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 9]</p>

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[Then]</span>  Job answered and said: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Yes, truly: I know it is so: 

<p class="indent-2"> But with God how can man urge his right? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Should He choose to contend against him, 

<p class="indent-2"> He could answer not one in a thousand. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Wise-hearted and strong as He is, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who hath ever successfully braved Him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Mountains He moves without effort, 

<p class="indent-2"> He turns them about in His anger. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He shaketh the earth from her place, 

<p class="indent-2"> And maketh her pillars shudder. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He speaks to the sun, and it shines not; 

<p class="indent-2"> He setteth a seal on the stars. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He strecheth the heavens all alone; 

<p class="indent-2"> He treadeth the heights of the sea. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He maketh the Bear and Orion. 

<p class="indent-2"> The Pleiades and the southern chambers. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He doeth great things and unsearchable, 

<p class="indent-2"> Marvellous things without number. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Lo! He passes me by all unseen; 

<p class="indent-2"> Sweeps past – but I cannot perceive Him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He seizeth, and who can prevent Him? 

<p class="indent-2"> Who dare ask Him, "What doest Thou?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  God will not withdraw His anger; 

<p class="indent-2"> The helpers of Rahab stooped under Him: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  How much less can I give Him answer, 

<p class="indent-2"> And choose out my words against Him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Were I right, I could give Him no answer, 

<p class="indent-2"> But needs must entreat my Judge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If I called, He would give me no answer; 

<p class="indent-2"> I cannot believe He would listen. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For He Crushes me in a temptest 

<p class="indent-2"> With many a wanton wound. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  He suffers me not to take breath, 

<p class="indent-2"> But with bitterness He fills me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Is it question of strength? There He is. 

<p class="indent-2"> Or of justice? Then who will implead Him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Am I right? Still mine own mouth condemns me. 

<p class="indent-2"> Innocent? He proveth me perverse. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Innocent I am – but I reck not. 

<p class="indent-2"> I spurn my life; ’tis all one. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And therefore it is that I say, 

<p class="indent-2"> "He destroyeth both guiltless and guilty." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When the scourge bringeth sudden death, 

<p class="indent-2"> The despair of the blameless He mocketh. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He hath given up the earth to the wicked; 

<p class="indent-2"> He veileth the face of its judges. 

<p class="indent-2"> If it be not He, who then? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  My days are more swift than a runner, 

<p class="indent-2"> They flee unillumined by joy. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  They glide like the ships of reed, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like an eagle that darts on its prey. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  If I vow to forget my plaint 

<p class="indent-2"> And to wear a bright face for a joyless, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  I shudder at all my pains; 

<p class="indent-2"> I know Thou wilt not hold me guiltless. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  I then am I infallibly guilty, 

<p class="indent-2"> So why should I labour in vain? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  For though I wash me with snow, 

<p class="indent-2"> And cleanse my hands with lye, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Thou wouldst plunge me then in the mire, 

<p class="indent-2"> So that even my friends would abhor me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Thou art not a man like myself, 

<p class="indent-2"> That we come into judgment together. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  O for an umpire between us, 

<p class="indent-2"> To lay his hand on us both! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Let Him take but His rod from off me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And affright me no more with His terrors, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  And then I would speak unafraid– 

<p class="indent-2"> For not such at heart am I. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 10]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In my soul is a loathing of life, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will let my complaint loose against Him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I will say to God, "Do not condemn me, 

<p class="indent-2"> But show me the ground of Thy quarrel. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  What dost Thou gain from oppressing 

<p class="indent-2"> And spurning the work of Thy hands? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Hast Thou then eyes of flesh? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or seest Thou as man seeth? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Are Thy days like the days of mortals, 

<p class="indent-1"> Or Thy years like the days of man, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  That Thou shouldest seek out my guilt, 

<p class="indent-2"> And make this search for my sin, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Though Thou knowest I am not guilty. 

<p class="indent-2"> And no treachery cleaves to my hand? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Thy hands did fashion and mould me; 

<p class="indent-2"> And now wilt Thou turn and destroy me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Remember Thou madest me like clay, 

<p class="indent-2"> And back to the dust wilt Thou bring me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Didst Thou not pour me out like milk, 

<p class="indent-2"> And curdle me after like cheese, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Clothe me with skin and with flesh, 

<p class="indent-2"> And knit me with bones and with sinews? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Life Thou didst grant me and favour, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy Providence guarded my spirit; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  While this was Thy secret heart, 

<p class="indent-2"> And this was Thy purpose, I know. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Do I sin? Then Thou dost observe me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And refuse to acquit me of guilt. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Am I wicked? Then woe us me. 

<p class="indent-2"> Just? I dare not lift up my head– 

<p class="indent-2"> Full of shame and drunken with sorrow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If I rise, like a lion Thou huntest me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Working fresh marvels upon me, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And bringing new witness against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> Thine anger with me Thou increasest, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou musterest fresh hosts against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  O why from the womb didst Thou bring me? 

<p class="indent-2"> O why died I not all unseen? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O to be as though I had not been, 

<p class="indent-2"> Borne from the womb to the grave! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Are the days of my life not few? 

<p class="indent-2"> O leave me to smile a little, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Ere I go to return no more, 

<p class="indent-2"> To the land of darkness and gloom, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  To the land of murky darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of gloom and utter confusion, 

<p class="indent-2"> Where the very light is as darkness." 

<h4>Zophar’s Appeal to the Unsearchable Wisdom</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Zophar of Naamah answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Should a voluble man go unanswered, 

<p class="indent-2"> A man who but babbles be justified? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Must men hold their peace at thy bragging? 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy mocking is no one to curb? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thou maintainest thy way to be pure, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thyself to be clean in His sight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But oh that God would speak, 

<p class="indent-2"> And open His lips against thee, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And show thee the secrets of wisdom– 

<p class="indent-2"> How marvellous are her achievements! 

<p class="indent-1"> For then thou shouldst know that thy guilt 

<p class="indent-2"> God remembers not wholly against thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Canst thou find out the deep things of God, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or come nigh the Almighty’s perfection? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It is higher than heaven – what canst thou? 

<p class="indent-2"> Deeper than Sheol – what knowest thou? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Longer than earth is its measure, 

<p class="indent-2"> And broader it is than the sea. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When He sweeps past and puts men in durance 

<p class="indent-2"> And calls them to trial, who can turn Him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For well He knoweth vain men: 

<p class="indent-2"> He looks upon sin and He marks it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Even a senseless man may be taught, 

<p class="indent-2"> As a wild ass’s colt may be caught. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now, if thou wouldst prepare thy heart, 

<p class="indent-2"> And stretch out thy hands unto Him, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And put away sin from thy hand, 

<p class="indent-2"> And let wrong dwell no more in thy tent, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then thy face thou wouldst lift without blemish, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thou wouldst be steadfast and fearless. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yea, thou wouldst forget thy sorrow– 

<p class="indent-2"> As floods that are passed wouldst thou think of it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Brighter than noon would thy life rise, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy darkness would be as the morning. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Secure wouldst thou be in thy hope: 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou couldst lie without trembling or care– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Lay thee down without one to affright thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And many would sue for thy favour. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, 

<p class="indent-2"> The place of their refuge is perished. 

<p class="indent-2"> Their hope is – to breathe their last. 

<h4>Job’s Independent Criticism of this World and his Glimpse beyond it</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Verily ye are the people, 

<p class="indent-2"> And wisdom shall die with you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But, like you, I have understanding; 

<p class="indent-2"> Who knoweth not things like these? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  A laughing-stock to his friend 

<p class="indent-2"> Is become one whose cry God had answered. 

<p class="indent-1"> A laughing-stock is the righteous; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[The]</span>  blameless is doomed to disaster. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> The man of ease mocks at his fate: 

<p class="indent-2"> There are thrusts for the feet that are slipping. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  It is tents of robbers that prosper, 

<p class="indent-2"> And those who vex God that are safe– 

<p class="indent-2"> Those who say, "Is not God in my hand?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But inquire of the beasts – they will teach thee; 

<p class="indent-2"> The birds of the air – they will show thee: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The creatures that crawl – they will teach thee; 

<p class="indent-2"> The fish of the sea – they will tell thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For which of them all doth not know 

<p class="indent-2"> That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In whose hand are all living souls 

<p class="indent-2"> And the breath of all humankind? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Doth not the ear test words 

<p class="indent-2"> As the palate tastes food for itself? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Doth wisdom depend upon years, 

<p class="indent-2"> Understanding on length of days? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  With Him is wisdom and might, 

<p class="indent-2"> Understanding and counsel are His. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  See! He breaketh down, and who buildeth? 

<p class="indent-2"> Imprisons, and none can set free. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  See! He holds back the floods and they dry; 

<p class="indent-2"> Then He hurls them on earth and confounds it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  With Him is strength and achievement; 

<p class="indent-2"> Deceived and deceiver are His. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The wise men of earth He makes foolish; 

<p class="indent-2"> The judges He turns into madmen. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The fetters kings rivet He loosens, 

<p class="indent-2"> And binds their own loins with a chain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He leadeth priests barefoot away; 

<p class="indent-2"> Ancient families He overturneth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He removeth the speech of the trusty; 

<p class="indent-2"> The elders He robs of discretion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He poureth contempt upon princes; 

<p class="indent-2"> He looseth the belt of the strong. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He revealeth the deep things of darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> The gloom-wrapped He bringeth to light. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  He makes nations great and destroys them; 

<p class="indent-2"> Expands them, then hurls them to ruin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Earth’s chiefs He bereaves of their judgment; 

<p class="indent-2"> They wander in trackles wastes, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Where they grope in the unit darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> And stagger like drunken men. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 13]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Lo! all this mine eye hath seen, 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine ear hath heard it and marked it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  What ye know, that I know too; 

<p class="indent-2"> I am not one whit behind you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But I would address the Almighty– 

<p class="indent-2"> With God I am longing to reason: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For ye are smearers of lies, 

<p class="indent-2"> Good-for-nothing physicians-each man of you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  O that ye were but silent– 

<p class="indent-2"> Then might ye be counted as wise. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now listen to this mine indictment, 

<p class="indent-2"> Attend to the plea of my lips. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Is it God that ye utter your lies for? 

<p class="indent-2"> Do ye speak you deceit for him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And to Him would ye show your favour? 

<p class="indent-2"> And God’s is the cause ye would plead? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Were it well if He searched you out? 

<p class="indent-2"> Can ye mock Him as men are mocked? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For He will punish you sore, 

<p class="indent-2"> If ye secretly show Him your favour. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Shall His majesty not make you shudder? 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall the dread of Him not full upon you? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; 

<p class="indent-2"> Your bulwarks are bulwarks of clay. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Be still, let me be: I will speak– 

<p class="indent-2"> Then upon me come what may. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I will take my flesh in my teeth; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will put my life in my hand. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  See! He slays me, I cannot endure; 

<p class="indent-2"> But my ways will I defend to His face: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And this, also, shall be my salvation, 

<p class="indent-2"> That a hypocrite dare not approach Him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Hear now my speech with attention, 

<p class="indent-2"> As I declare in your ears. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Attend as I set forth my case; 

<p class="indent-2"> I know that the right is with me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And if any disputeth against me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then I would be silent and die. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But two things alone do not unto me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then I will not hide from Thy face. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Lift the weight of Thy hand from off me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And let not Thy terrors appal me: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then call Thou, and I will answer; 

<p class="indent-2"> Or let me speak, and answer Thou me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  How great is my guilt and transgressions? 

<p class="indent-2"> Acquaint me with my sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  O why dost Thou hide Thy face, 

<p class="indent-2"> And count me as Thine enemy? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Wilt Thou harass a leaf that is tossed? 

<p class="indent-2"> Wilt Thou chase the withered stubble, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  That Thou passest a judgment so bitter, 

<p class="indent-2"> Entailing upon me the sins of my youth? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Thou dost fasten a block on my feet, 

<p class="indent-2"> And set watch over all my ways. 

<p class="indent-1"> Round my roots Thou cuttest a line, 

<p class="c-num">[Job 14]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5c]</span>  Setting bounds tha they may not pass; 

<p class="c-num">[Job 13]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  While man doth waste with decay, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a garment devoured of the moth. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 14]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Man that is born of a woman 

<p class="indent-2"> Is of few days and filled with trouble. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He comes forth like a flower and he withers; 

<p class="indent-2"> He flees like a shadow and stays not. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  On such dost Thou open Thine eyes? 

<p class="indent-2"> And him wouldst Thou bring to Thy judgment? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Who can bring from the unclean the clean? 

<p class="indent-2"> Not one is free from sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5a]</span>  Seeing, then, that his days are decreed, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[5b]</span>  And the tale of his months is with Thee, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Look away, and let him have peace, 

<p class="indent-2"> To enjoy like a hireling his day. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For hope there may be for a tree: 

<p class="indent-2"> Though cut down, it may sprout once again, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the shoots there from need to fail. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Though its root in the earth wax old, 

<p class="indent-2"> And its stem be dead in the ground, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It may bud at the scent of water, 

<p class="indent-2"> And put forth boughs like a plant. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But the strong man dies and lies prostrate; 

<p class="indent-2"> Man breathes his last and where is he? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Like the floods of a vanished sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a river dry and withered– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12b]</span>  Till the heavens be no more, he awakes not, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[12c]</span>  Nor ever is roused from his sleep. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  O wouldst Thou but hide me in Sheol 

<p class="indent-2"> Out of sight, till Thine anger be past, 

<p class="indent-1"> And then call me to mind in Thine own set time! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If a dead man may live once again, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> I could wait all the days of my warfare 

<p class="indent-2"> Until my release shoud come. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Thou shouldst call, and I would answer: 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou wouldst year for the work of Thy hands. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But now Thou countest my steps, 

<p class="indent-2"> And passest not over my sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My transgressions is sealed in a bag; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou hast fastened secure mine iniquity. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But the very hills crumble to pieces, 

<p class="indent-2"> The rocks are moved out of their place; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Water wears stone to dust, 

<p class="indent-2"> The floods wash the soil away: 

<p class="indent-1"> So the hope of man Thou destroyest; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12a]</span>  He lieth, to rise up no more. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Thou dost worst him for ever; he passeth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Dismissed – with his face how changed! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Honour comes to his sons, but he knows not: 

<p class="indent-2"> Or shame, but he doth not perceive it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But the flesh upon him feels pain, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the soul within him is sorrowful. 

<h5>ACT II</h5>

<h4>Eliphaz’s Appeal to the Unadulterated Doctrine of the Past</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 15]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Would a wise man pour forth windy answers 

<p class="indent-2"> Or fill with the east wind his breast? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Would he reason with profitless words 

<p class="indent-2"> And with speech that is all unavailing? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  See! thou art destroying religion, 

<p class="indent-2"> Disturbing devout contemplation. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Thy guilt instructeth thy mouth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Thine own mouth condems thee – not I, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thine own lips are witness against thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Wast thou the first man to be born? 

<p class="indent-2"> Wast thou fashioned before the hills? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Wast thou one of the heavenly council? 

<p class="indent-2"> Was wisdom revealed unto thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  What knowest thou that we know not? 

<p class="indent-2"> What insight is thine and not ours? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  With us are the grey and the aged, 

<p class="indent-2"> More mighty in years than thy father. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Dost thou spurn the divine consolations, 

<p class="indent-2"> The word that dealt with thee so gently? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  How fierce the emotions that sweep thee! 

<p class="indent-2"> And how thou flashest thine eyes, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  As thou turnest thy breath against God 

<p class="indent-2"> Into words from thy rebel lips! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  What is man that he should be clean, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or just – one of woman born? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  See! He putteth no trust in His saints, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the heavens are not clean in His sight: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  How much less one abhorrent and tainted– 

<p class="indent-2"> A man that drinks evil like water! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Now listen to what I will show thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> The thing I have seen I will tell– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Even tales that were told by the wise 

<p class="indent-2"> And not hidden from them by their fathers, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Who had the land all to themselves, 

<p class="indent-2"> When no stranger had yet come among them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  All his days is the wicked in pain, 

<p class="indent-2"> All the years for the tyrant appointed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  In his ears is the sound of terrors, 

<p class="indent-2"> In peace comes the spoiler upon him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He cannot escape from the darkness 

<p class="indent-2"> And he is reserved for the sword. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Appointed as food for the vulture– 

<p class="indent-2"> He knows that his doom is at hand. 

<p class="indent-1"> The day of darkness appals him; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24a]</span>  Constraint and distress overpower him; 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For he stretched out his hand against God, 

<p class="indent-2"> Played the warrior against the Almighty, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Running against Him stiff-necked 

<p class="indent-2"> With the thick of the boss of his bucklers, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24b]</span>  Like a king prepared for the onset. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  He covered his face with his fat, 

<p class="indent-2"> He set thick folds of flesh on his loins; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And he dwelt in desolate cities, 

<p class="indent-2"> In houses that none should inhabit. 

<p class="indent-1"> What he has won, others shall capture, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  His substance shall not endure. 

<p><p class="indent-2"> On the earth he shall cast no shadow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30b]</span>  The fierce heat shall wither his branches, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30c]</span>  His fruit shall the wind whirl away. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Let him not trust his plant when it shoots, 

<p class="indent-2"> For the branch thereof shall be vanity. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  It shall wither before its time, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or ever its fronds become green. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  His grapes he shall shed like the vine, 

<p class="indent-2"> And cast off like the olive his blossom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  For a barren tribe are the godless; 

<p class="indent-2"> Tents of bribery the fire shall consume. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Big with mischief, they bring forth sin, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their belly matures with deceit. 

<h4>Job’s Cry to the Witness in Heaven</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 16]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Many things such as these have I heard: 

<p class="indent-2"> Ye are wearisome comforters – all of you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Shall windy words have an end? 

<p class="indent-2"> What is it that provokes thee to answer? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I, too, could speak like you, 

<p class="indent-2"> Were your soul in my soul’s stead. 

<p class="indent-1"> I could weave words together about you, 

<p class="indent-2"> And shake my head at you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I could strengthen you with my mouth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And encourage you with lip-comfort. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  To speak is no check to my pain; 

<p class="indent-2"> To keep silence – that easeth me nothing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But now He hath wearied and dazed me; 

<p class="indent-2"> My misery seizes upon me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It rises for witness against me; 

<p class="indent-2"> My grief testifies to my face. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  In His wrath He hath flung me down torn; 

<p class="indent-2"> He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth. 

<p class="indent-1"> My foes whet their eyes upon me; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  With open mouth they gape. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> They insult me with blows on the cheek, 

<p class="indent-2"> Coming on in their masses against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To knaves God has given me up; 

<p class="indent-2"> Into wicked hands He has hurled me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I was happy, when He took and shattered me; 

<p class="indent-2"> Grasped my neck, and then dashed me in pieces. 

<p class="indent-1"> He set me up for His target; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On all sides His archers beset me. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> He cleaves through my reins unrelenting; 

<p class="indent-2"> He pours out my gall on the ground. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  One breach after another He makes on me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Rushing at me like a warrior. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Sackcloth I sewed on my skin, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my horn I have laid in the dust. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  My face is red with weeping, 

<p class="indent-2"> And over mine eye-lids is darkness– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Though wrong there is none in my hands, 

<p class="indent-2"> And though my prayer be pure. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  O earth! cover not my blood; 

<p class="indent-2"> No rest let there be to my crying. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Behold, in heaven is my Witness, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I have a Sponsor on high. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  My friends pour their scorn upon me, 

<p class="indent-2"> But my tear-stained eyes look unto God, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  That He plead for a man with God, 

<p class="indent-2"> And for son of man with his Friend. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For when but a few years come, 

<p class="indent-2"> I shall go whence I shall not return. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 17]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  His anger hath ruined my days, 

<p class="indent-2"> And for me is left nought but the grave. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Delusion is surely my portion; 

<p class="indent-2"> On bitterness tarries mine eye. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Lay a pledge for me – Thou with Thyself: 

<p class="indent-2"> For who else would strike hands with me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For their heart Thou hast hidden from wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And therefore Thou wilt not exalt them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  One inviteth his friends to a feast, 

<p class="indent-2"> While the eyes of his children are failing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Thou has made me the by-word of nations; 

<p class="indent-2"> They look upon me as a monster. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Mine eye is grown dim for vexation; 

<p class="indent-2"> My members are all as a shadow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  My days pass away without hope; 

<p class="indent-2"> The desires of my heart are extinguished. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The night I turn into day, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the light is before me as darkness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  If I hope, then the grave is my home, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my couch I have spread in the darkness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I call to the pit, "My mother"; 

<p class="indent-2"> And unto the worm, "My sister." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Where then were that "hope" of mine? 

<p class="indent-2"> And my happiness who can espy? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Will it go with me down to the grave? 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall we sink to the dust together? 

<h4>Bildad’s Picture of the Sure and Terrible Doom of the Wicked</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When with thou end thy words? 

<p class="indent-2"> Now consider, and we shall speak. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Why are we counted as breasts, 

<p class="indent-2"> And deemed by thee to be dullards? 

<p class="c-num">[Job 17]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Honest men thrill with horror at this: 

<p class="indent-2"> A pure man is roused by such godlessness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But the righteous holds on his way, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the man of clean hands waxes stronger. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10a]</span>  But turn thee hither and come, 

<p class="c-num">[Job 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> For thy sake shall earth be made desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or rock be moved out of its place? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Nay, the light of the wicked is quenced, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the flame of his fire shall not shine. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The light in his tent shall be dark, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the lamp o’er his head shall go out. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  His great swinging strides become shortened; 

<p class="indent-2"> His own counsel maketh him stumble. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  His foot is thrust into a net, 

<p class="indent-2"> So that over the net-work ge sprawleth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  A snare shall take hold of his heel, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a trap shall close tightly upon him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A noose lies concealed on the ground, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a trap on his path doth await him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  On all sides are terrors appalling, 

<p class="indent-2"> Pursuing him close at his heels. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For him shall misfortune be hungry; 

<p class="indent-2"> Disaster is ready to throw him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The pestilence gnaws at his skin, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the first-born of death at his members. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then, dragged from his tent in despair, 

<p class="indent-2"> He is marched to the King of Terrors. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  His house shall be haunted by ghosts; 

<p class="indent-2"> On his homestead shall brimstone be scattered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  His roots shall be dried up beneath, 

<p class="indent-2"> And above shall his branches be withered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  From earth shall his memory perish; 

<p class="indent-2"> No name shall be his on the streets. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  From the light he is thrust into darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> And chased right out of the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Of his folk, neither kith nor kin– 

<p class="indent-2"> Where he sojourned, not one is left. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The west is appalled at his doom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the east is stricken with horror. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Yea, such are the homes of the wicked, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of those who care nothing for God. 

<h4>Job’s Sublime Faith in his Future Vindication</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 19]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  How long will ye vex my soul 

<p class="indent-2"> And crush me to pieces with words? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  These ten times ye have put me to shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> And set upon me unabashedly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Well, be it that I have erred– 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine error abides with myself. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Or would ye be haughty to me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And insult me with your reproaches? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Know, then, it is God that hath wronged me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And compassed me round with His net. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Behold! I cry "Wrong" – but no answer; 

<p class="indent-2"> I call – but justice is none. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  My way He hath fenced round impassably, 

<p class="indent-2"> Darkness He sets on my path. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He hath stripped my glory from off me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And taken the crown from my head. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He hath torn me clean down – I am gone: 

<p class="indent-2"> He hath plucked up my hope like a tree. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He hath kindled His anger against me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And counted me one of His enenmies. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On come His troops together; 

<p class="indent-2"> They throw up a rampart against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  My brethren are gone far from me; 

<p class="indent-2"> My friends have estranged themselves from me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  My neighbours have ceased to acknowledge me; 

<p class="indent-2"> Guests of my house have forgotten me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Maids of mine count me a stranger; 

<p class="indent-2"> An alien am I in their sight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To my servant I call, but he answers not, 

<p class="indent-2"> Till with my mouth I entreat him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My breath is strange to my wife, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my stench to mine own very children. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Yea, even young boys despise me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mock me when I try to rise. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  All mine intimate friends abhor me; 

<p class="indent-2"> The man whom I love turns against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  My skin clings to my bones; 

<p class="indent-2"> I escape with my flesh in my teeth.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  See! the moon herself is not clear, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the stars are not pure in His sight: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  How much less is man – a mere maggot;

<p class="c-num">[Job 26]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Before Him in pain writhe the giants,

<p class="indent-2"> Yet the clouds are not torn with the weight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He closeth the face of His throne, 

<p class="indent-2"> And over it spreadeth His cloud. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A circle He drew on the deep,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The pillars of heaven fell a-rocking,

<h4>The Last Clash – Between Job and Zophar</h4>

<h5>Job</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 27]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  As God Almighty liveth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who hath wronged and embittered my soul– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For within me my life is yet whole, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the spirit of God in my nostrils– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I swear that my lips speak no falsehood, 

<p class="indent-2"> My tongue doth not utter deceit. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  God forbid I shoud grant ye were right; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will cling to mine innocence till I die. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I maintain to the end I am guiltless; 

<p class="indent-2"> Not an hour of my life do I blush for. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Ye have all with your own eyes seen it: 

<p class="indent-2"> Wherefore, then, this idle folly? 

<h5>Zophar</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Perish my foe like the wicked, 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine enemy as the unrighteous. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For what is the hope of the godless, 

<p class="indent-2"> When God requireth his soul? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Will God give ear to his cry, 

<p class="indent-2"> In the day when distress comes upon him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Will Almighty be then his delight? 

<p class="indent-2"> When he calleth, will God be entreated? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I will teach you how God wields His arm, 

<p class="indent-2"> And not hide the Almighty’s behaviour. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The wicked man’s portion from God is this, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the lot the Almighty bestows on the tyrant: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If his children grow up, the sword claims them; 

<p class="indent-2"> His offspring are stinted for bread. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  By death shall his remnant be buried, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their widows shall make no lament. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Though silver he heap up like dust, 

<p class="indent-2"> And prepare (costly) raiment like clay, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Yet the just shall put on what he stored, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the silver shall fall to the innocent. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Like a spider’s the house which he builded, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like booth which the vine-keeper maketh. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He lieth down rich, but he wakes not; 

<p class="indent-2"> He openeth his eyes, and he is not.

<p class="indent-2"> In the night he is stolen by a tempest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The east wind bears him away; 

<p class="indent-2"> It sweepeth him out of his place.

<p class="indent-2"> Fain would he escape from His hand. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  His hands He clappeth at him, 

<p class="indent-2"> And He hisseth at him from His place. 

<h4>Job’s Great Defence and His Last Appeal</h4>

<h5>The Happy Past</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 29]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Job answered and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  O to be as in months long gone, 

<p class="indent-2"> As in days when God used to keep me, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When His lamp shone over my head, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I walked by His light through the darkness; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  As I was in the days of mine autumn, 

<p class="indent-2"> When God protected my tent, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  While still the Almighty was with me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my children were round about me; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When my steps were bathed in milk, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the rock poured me rivers of oil! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When I went to the city gate, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or took up my place in the open, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The youths, when they saw me, hid. 

<p class="indent-2"> The old men rose and stood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Princes refrained from speech, 

<p class="indent-2"> And laid their hand on their mouth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The voice of the nobles was hushed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their tongue would cleave to their palate. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  They hearkened to me and they waited, 

<p class="indent-2"> Kept silence till I should give counsel; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  After I spoke, they spake not again, 

<p class="indent-2"> My speech fell like rain-drops upon them, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  They waited for me as for rain– 

<p class="indent-2"> Open-mouthed, as for latter rain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When I smiled upon them, they were strengthened; 

<p class="indent-2"> The light of my face cheered the sorrowing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  I chose out their way and sat chief, 

<p class="indent-2"> Enthroned like a king in his army. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I was blessed by the ear that heard me, 

<p class="indent-2"> The eye bore me witness that saw me; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For I rescued the poor when he cried, 

<p class="indent-2"> The fatherless and the helpless. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The wretched gave me their blessing, 

<p class="indent-2"> The widow’s heart I made sing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I put on the garment of righteousness, 

<p class="indent-2"> A robe and a turban of justice. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Eyes was I to the blind, 

<p class="indent-2"> Feet to the lame was I; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  A father was I to the poor, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I searched out the cause of the stranger. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I shattered the jaws of the wicked, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hurled the prey from his teeth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So I thought, "I shall die with my nest, 

<p class="indent-2"> As the sand my days shall be many. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  My root is spread out to the waters, 

<p class="indent-2"> All night lies the dew on my branches. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Within me my glory is fresh, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my bow is renewed in my hand." 

<h5>The Awful Present</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 30]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But now am I become their song, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea, I am a by-word among them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In horror they stand far aloof, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they spare not to spit at the sight of me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He hath slackened my bow-string, and humbled me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Flung down my banner before me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Against me His hosts stand up, 

<p class="indent-2"> They raise deadly ramparts against me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  My path they tear up clean, 

<p class="indent-2"> My tracks they destroy altogether. 

<p class="indent-1"> His Archers ring me around, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As through a wide breach they come in, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Rolling on in the midst of the ruin. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Terrors are turned upon me; 

<p><p class="indent-1"> My weal is the sport of the winds, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my welfare is passed like a cloud. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And now is my soul poured out, 

<p class="indent-2"> The terrors of misery seize me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The night boreth into my bones, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the pains that gnaw never slumber, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  From sore wasting my garments is shrunk; 

<p class="indent-2"> It clingeth to me like my vest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  (God) hath plunged me into the mire, 

<p class="indent-2"> So that I am like dust and ashes. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I cry, but Thou givest no answer; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou standest and heedest me not. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Cruel to me art Thou turned; 

<p class="indent-2"> With the might of Thy hand Thou dost scourge me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Thou settest me to ride on the wind, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I melt in the roar of the storm. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For I know Thou wilt bring me to death, 

<p class="indent-2"> To the house where all living assemble. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Yet sinking men stretch out their hand, 

<p class="indent-2"> And cry for help as they perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He whose days are hard – does he weep not? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is the soul of the needy not grieved? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For instead of the good I had hoped for came evil, 

<p class="indent-2"> Instead of the light I waited came darkness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  My heart is hot and restless, 

<p class="indent-2"> And misery daily confronts me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  I got with my sorrow uncomforted, 

<p class="indent-2"> Standing where jackals are gathered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Brother am I to the wolves, 

<p class="indent-2"> And of ostriches the companion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  All backened my skin peels from off me; 

<p class="indent-2"> My bones are burned with the heat. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  So my lyre is turned into mourning, 

<p class="indent-2"> My pipe to the voice of lament. 

<h5>The Defence and Final Appeal</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 31]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A tyrst I made with mine eyes 

<p class="indent-2"> To give no heed unto folly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For how doth the high God reward it– 

<p class="indent-2"> The Almighty in heaven requite it? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Is not for the wicked misfortune– 

<p class="indent-2"> Disaster for workers of wrong? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Doth He not see my ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> And number my steps every one? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  If ever I walked with falsehood, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or my foot hath made haste unto fraud– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Let God only weigh wish just balance, 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine innocence He must acknowledge– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If my step ever swerved from the way. 

<p class="indent-2"> Or my heart hath gone after mine eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or spot hath cleaved to my hands, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then what I sow may others enjoy, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all produce of mine be uprooted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If my heart hath been lured by a woman, 

<p class="indent-2"> If I lurked at my neighbour’s door, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  May my own wife grind to another, 

<p class="indent-2"> And let others bow down upon her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For that were an infamous crime, 

<p class="indent-2"> An iniquity calling for judgment, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  A fire that devours to Abaddon 

<p class="indent-2"> And would all mine increase consume. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Never spurned I the cause of my servant– 

<p class="indent-2"> Of man or of maid – when we strove. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Did not He that made me make him, 

<p class="indent-2"> Did not One fashion us in the womb? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Ne’er denied I the wish of the poor, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor brought grief to the eyes of the widow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Never ate I my morsel alone, 

<p class="indent-2"> Without sharing thereof with the orphan. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Else what should I do, when God rose? 

<p class="indent-2"> When He visited, what should I answer? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For father-like, He brought me up from my youth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And my Guide has He been from my mother’s womb. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Never saw I one naked and perishing– 

<p class="indent-2"> Needy, with nothing to cover him– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But I warmed him with fleece from my lambs, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his loins gave me their blessing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  If, beacause I saw help in the gate, 

<p class="indent-2"> I have ever set hand on the innocent, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Let my shoulder fall from its blade, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mine arm from the socketh be broken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Never set I my trust upon gold, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor called the fine gold my confidence. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Mine abundant wealth never elated me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor all that my hands had gotten. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Never, watching the shining lights, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or the moon as she walked in her splendour, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Did my heart feel their subtle allurement, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or my hand throw a kiss to my mouth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  This, too, were a crime for the judges, 

<p class="indent-2"> For to God above I had lied: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The terrors of God would assail me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Before whose approach I were powerless. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Ne’er rejoiced I at enemy’s fall, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor triumphed when evil befel him; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Not suffered my mouth to sin, 

<p class="indent-2"> By demanding his life in a curse. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The men of my tent will declare 

<p class="indent-2"> None has ever been stinted of food. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Not a stranger e’er lodged in the street, 

<p class="indent-2"> For I opened my doors to the wayfarer. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  If my land ever cried out against me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Her furrows all weeping together; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  If her strength I have drained without cost, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or have poured out the life of her owner; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Let thorns take the place of wheat, 

<p class="indent-2"> And foul-smelling weeds – of barley. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  No fear of the crowd ever led me 

<p class="indent-2"> To hide my sin among men. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  No contempt of the clans ever scared me 

<p class="indent-2"> To stay behind closed doors in silence. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  O for One who would listen to me. 

<p class="indent-2"> Behold! there is my cross! 

<p class="indent-2"> Let Almighty God give me His answer. 

<p class="indent-1"> O would that I had the indicment 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine Adversary hath written! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  For, bearing it high on my shoulder, 

<p class="indent-2"> And winding it round like a crown, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Every step of my life I would tell Him,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The wing of the ostrich beats joyously,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Forgetting that foot may crush them,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Her young she treats harshly, as strangers,

<p class="indent-2"> At the horse and his rider she laugheth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Dost thou give to the war-horse his strength,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Dost thou make him to leap like a locust, 

<p class="indent-2"> With snort that is splendid and terrible? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He paweth the valley exulting, 

<p class="indent-2"> As forth to the fight the fares. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He laughs undismayed at the terror, 

<p class="indent-2"> He turneth not back from the sword. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Against him the quiver may rattle, 

<p class="indent-2"> The glittering spear or the dart: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He devoureth the ground in wild rage, 

<p class="indent-2"> Without turning to right hand or left. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  At the trumpet alarm he saith "Ha!" 

<p class="indent-2"> For he scenteth the battle afar, 

<p class="indent-2"> The thunder of captains, the shouting. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Doth the hawk soar aloft by thy wisdom. 

<p class="indent-2"> And spread out her wings to the south? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Doth the eagle mount up at thy bidding, 

<p class="indent-2"> And make her nest high on the mountains? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  The cliff is her home where she lodges– 

<p class="indent-2"> The peak of the cliff and the fortress, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  She spieth her prey from the heights 

<p class="indent-2"> With those eyes that see from afar. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Her young ones suck up blood:

<h5>The Rebuke</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 40]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Shall a caviller strive with Almighty? 

<p class="indent-2"> He that argues with God – let him answer. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Wilt thou disallow my right. 

<p class="indent-2"> And condemn me that thou mayest be justified? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Hast thou an arm like God? 

<p class="indent-2"> With a voice like His canst thou thunder? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now deck thee with pride and with majesty, 

<p class="indent-2"> Clothe thee with glory and splendour. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Pour forth the floods of thine anger, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all that is lofty abase. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Every proud one lay low whom thou seest, 

<p class="indent-2"> And crush thou the wicked beneath thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Hide them together in dust, 

<p class="indent-2"> And bind their faces in darkness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And I then will render thee praise 

<p class="indent-2"> That thy right hand hath won thee the victory. 

<h4>Job’s HUmble and Penitent Reply</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 40]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Job answered Jehovah and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Ah, how small am I! What can I answer? 

<p class="indent-2"> I lay my hand on my mouth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Once indeed have I spoken; – enough: 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea twice – but not ever again. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 42]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I acknowledge that Thou hast prevailed; 

<p class="indent-2"> There is nothing too hard for Thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3b]</span>  Therefore spake I without understanding, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[3c]</span>  Of wonders beyond my knowledge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I had heard of Thee but by hearsay, 

<p class="indent-2"> But now mine eye hath seen Thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And therefore I spurn (my words) 

<p class="indent-2"> And repent in dust and in ashes. 

<h5>The Epilogue</h5>

<h4>The Friends Rebuked</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Job 43]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So after Jehovah has spoken these words to Job,  He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My anger is  hot against thee and thy two friends; because,  unlike my servant Job, ye have not spoken the  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  truth about me. But now, go to my servant Job  with seven bullocks and seven rams, and offer them  as a burnt-offering for yourselves, and my servant  Job shall pray for you; for, our of regard for him,  I will not put you to confusion for your failure to  speak the truth about me, as my servant Job has  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  done." So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the  Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did  as Jehovah told them, and Jehovah had regard unto  Job. 

<h4>The Restoration of Job</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So when Job prayed for his friends, Jehovah  changed his fortunes, giving him double of all he  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  had before. Then his brothers and sister and old  friends came – every one of them – and dined  with him at his home; and they condoled with  him, and comforted him for all the misery that  Jehovah had brought upon him. Besides, each of  them made him a present of a piece of money and a  gold ring.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Thus in the end Jehovah made Job more blessed  than he was at the first – with his fourteen thousand  sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  oxen, and one thousand she-asses. Besides, he had  seven sons, and three daughters whom he named  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  in the order of their birth Jemimah, Keziah, and  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Keren-happuch. In all the world were no women  found so fair as the daughters of Job, and their  father made them sharers in his inheritance with  their brothers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  After this Job lived a hundred and forty years.  Thus he was spared to see not only his children, but  his grandchildren – four generations. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Job died – old and full of days. 

<h5>Elihu’s Interpretation of Suffering</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Job 32]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now these three men ceased answering Job,  because he was righteous in his own eyes. Then  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite,  of the family of Ram, was kindled; against Job  was his anger kindled, because he had made himself  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  out to be more righteous than God. But his anger  was kindled against his three friends as well,  because they had condemned Job without finding  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  any answer. Now, as they were older, Elihu had  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  waited while they were speaking with Job; but,  on seeing that the three men had no answer to offer,  Elihu’s anger was kindled. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite  answered and said:  I am but young in years, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> While ye are aged men: 

<p class="indent-1"> So I was timid, and feared 

<p class="indent-2"> To set my opinion before you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I felt that days ought to speak, 

<p class="indent-2"> And that years gave the right to teach wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But the spririt enlighteneth men, 

<p class="indent-2"> The Almighty inspires then with insight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It is not the old men that are wise, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor the aged that understand truth; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And so, pray, listen to me– 

<p class="indent-2"> I, too, would set forth my opinion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11a]</span>  I waited what you had to say, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11b]</span>  I lent mine ear to your reasons; 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12a]</span>  Yea, I gave heed unto you, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11c]</span>  While ye searched out what to say. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12b]</span>  But see! none brought conviction to Job, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12c]</span>  Not a man of you answered his words. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Say not "Here wer have come upon wisdom; 

<p class="indent-2"> ’Tis God must confound him, not man." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He hath not yet debated with me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor will I give him answers like yours. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Panic-stricken they answer no more, 

<p class="indent-2"> Words have floated away from them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Must I wait because they are silent, 

<p class="indent-2"> Stand still, and answer no more? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Nay, but I, too, will answer my share; 

<p class="indent-2"> I, too, will set forth my opinion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For filled with words am I; 

<p class="indent-2"> The breath in my body distress me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Like wine without vent is my belly, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like new wine-skins ready to burst. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I must speak and so find me relief; 

<p class="indent-2"> I must open my lips and make answer. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I would show my favour to none, 

<p class="indent-2"> And give flattering titles to no man. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Of flattery I know nothing– 

<p class="indent-2"> Else soon would my Maker remove me. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 33]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But listen, Job, pray, to my words, 

<p class="indent-2"> And give ear unto all that I say. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Behold! I have opened my mouth; 

<p class="indent-2"> My tongue in my palate hath spoken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  MY heart poureth forth words of knowledge; 

<p class="indent-2"> Unfeigned is the speech of my lips. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then answer me this, if thou canst: 

<p class="indent-2"> Stand up and debate with me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  See! I am in God’s sight as thou; 

<p class="indent-2"> I, too, was fashioned to clay. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The spirit of God hath created me; 

<p class="indent-2"> My life is the breath of Almighty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  See! no terrors of mine need appal thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor shall my hand lie heavy upon thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Thou hast certainly said in my hearing, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy voice I heard thus maintaining: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  "Pure and sinless am I; 

<p class="indent-2"> I am clean, there is no guilt in me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But He findeth pretexts against me, 

<p class="indent-2"> He counteth me as His foe. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He setteth my feet in the stocks, 

<p class="indent-2"> Keepeth watch over all my ways. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Behold! when I cry, comes no answer: 

<p class="indent-2"> God hideth Himself from men." 

<h5>God speaks to Men through Dreams and Visions</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now why dost thou plead against Him 

<p class="indent-2"> That He giveth thy words no answer? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For God hath one manner of speech, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea two – and He doth not revoke it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  In a dream, in a vision of night, 

<p class="indent-2"> "When deep sleep falleth on men," 

<p class="indent-2"> In slumbers upon the bed, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then He opens the ears of men, 

<p class="indent-2"> And sendeth them fearful warnings, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To turn men aside from wrong, 

<p class="indent-2"> And to bring human pride to an end– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  To keep back man’s soul from the pit 

<p class="indent-2"> And his life from descending to Sheol. 

<h5>God speaks to Men through Pain and Sickness</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Or on bed of pain he is chastened, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all his bones are benumbed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  His soul has a loathing of bread, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the daintiest food he abhorreth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  His flesh is lean and wasted; 

<p class="indent-2"> His bones are all but bare. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  His soul draweth nigh to the pit, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his life to the angels of death. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then over him there is an angel 

<p class="indent-2"> Interpreter, one of a thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who expounds unto man his chastisement, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Takes pity on him and says: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Let him not go down to the pit: 

<p class="indent-2"> I have found (for his soul) a ransom." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then his flesh becomes fresher than child’s, 

<p class="indent-2"> He returns to the days of his youth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  He prays unto God with acceptance, 

<p class="indent-2"> He looks on His face with joy, 

<p class="indent-2"> Tells the story of his salvation, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And sings before men this song: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> "I have sinned and perverted the right, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yet He hath not requited my sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  He hath ransomed my soul from the pit, 

<p class="indent-2"> That alive I behold the light." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  See! all these things God doeth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Twice, yea thrice, with a man, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  To bring back his soul from the pit, 

<p class="indent-2"> With the light of life’s sunshine upon him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Be attentive, Job, listen to me; 

<p class="indent-2"> Be thou silent, and I will speak. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  If aught thou canst say, then answer me: 

<p class="indent-2"> Speak, for my wish is to clear thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But if not, listen thou unto me: 

<p class="indent-2"> Be silent, while I teach thee wisdom. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 34]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Elihu went on: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Listen, ye wise, to my words, 

<p class="indent-2"> And give ear to me, ye that have knowledge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For the ear is the tester of words 

<p class="indent-2"> As the palate the taster of food. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Let us choose for ourselves what is good. 

<p class="indent-2"> Recognise by ourselves what is good. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For Job claimeth to be in the right: 

<p class="indent-2"> "God," he says, "hath deprived me of justice. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Though right, I am counted a liar; 

<p class="indent-2"> And though sinless, He wounds me past healing." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Where is the man like Job 

<p class="indent-2"> That drinketh up scorning like water, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  That leagues with the workers of wrong, 

<p class="indent-2"> And that walketh with wicked men? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For he saith that a mn hath no profit 

<p class="indent-2"> From being the friend of God. 

<h5>God watches over the Moral Order</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So, ye men of intelligence, listen. 

<p class="indent-1"> Far be it from God to do evil, 

<p class="indent-2"> And from the Almighty to err. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For the work of each man He requiteth; 

<p class="indent-2"> He bringeth his way back upon him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  God assuredly cannot do wrong. 

<p class="indent-2"> The Almighty would not pervert justice. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Who entrusted the earth to His charge? 

<p class="indent-2"> And who watcheth over the universe? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If He should recall His spirit 

<p class="indent-2"> And gather His breath to Himself, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  All flesh together would perish, 

<p class="indent-2"> And man would return to the dust. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If thou art wise, listen to this, 

<p class="indent-2"> And give ear to the sound of my words.

<p class="indent-2"> To nobles, "Ye infamous men!"– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Who showeth no favour to princes, 

<p class="indent-2"> Regardeth not rich more than poor? 

<p class="indent-1"> For the work of His hands are they all: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  In a moment they die – at midnight. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> The rich are convulsed, they pass: 

<p class="indent-2"> He mysteriously removeth the mighty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For His eyes are over man’s ways,

<p class="indent-2"> He smites them in presence of witnesses;

<p class="indent-2"> For the wickedness of his answers! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  For he addeth rebellion to sin,

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Elihu went on: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Thinkest thou this to be just, 

<p class="indent-2"> Dost thou call it they right before God, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  To ask, "What advantage is mine? 

<p class="indent-2"> What the better am I, if I sin not?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Well, I will give thee an answer, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy three friends as well. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Look to the heavens and see,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Under sore oppression men cry

<p class="indent-2"> Because of their impious pride. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For to idle cries God will not listen, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor will the Almighty regard them.

<p class="indent-2"> Be still and wait patiently for Him.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Job opens his mouth thus idly, 

<p class="indent-2"> And poureth forth words without knowledge.

<p class="c-num">[Job 36]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Elihu continued: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Wait, I pray, but a while; I will show thee: 

<p class="indent-2"> I have yet to say somewhat for God. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  With knowledge fetched from afar 

<p class="indent-2"> I will justify my Creator. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For truly my words are no lie; 

<p class="indent-2"> One in knowledge complete stands before thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Behold, God spurneth the stubborn, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The wicked He spareth not: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> But He granteth the rights of the wretched, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Withdraws not their due from the just. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> It has happened to kings on the throne, 

<p class="indent-2"> seated in pride and glory, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  That prisoners in chains they became, 

<p class="indent-2"> Held fast in the cords of misery: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then He set forth before them their doings, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their proud and rebellious behaviour; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He opened their ears to instruction 

<p class="indent-2"> And bade them turn back from sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If they hearken and do Him homage, 

<p class="indent-2"> They finish their days in prosperity. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But if stubborn, they pass to Sheol, 

<p class="indent-2"> They die without coming to knowledge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For, godless at heart, they grow sullen; 

<p class="indent-2"> They cry not for help when He binds them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They die in the days of their youth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like sodomites they perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The sufferer He saveth through sufferings; 

<p class="indent-2"> Adversity opens his ear. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But thou hast been lured by thy freedom, 

<p class="indent-2"> By ease at the jaws of distress,

<p class="indent-2"> Nor let the high ransom deflect thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Wouldst thou marshall thy plaint against Him,

<h5>God’s Marvellous Ways in Nature</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  See! God by His power doeth loftily– 

<p class="indent-2"> Who is a teacher like Him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Who hath enjoined Him His way? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or who hath said, "Thou doest wrongly"? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Remember to magnify Him 

<p class="indent-2"> For His work, whereof men have sung. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  All men look with pleasure thereon, 

<p class="indent-2"> Though man seeth it but from afar. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Behold! God is great beyond knowledge, 

<p class="indent-2"> The tale of His years beyond search. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For He draweth up drops from the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> Which He poureth in rain from His Vapour, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Wherewith, as the clouds distil, 

<p class="indent-2"> They drop down in showers upon men. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Who can tell how the clouds are spread out, 

<p class="indent-2"> How He thunders from His pavilion? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  He spreadeth His vapour around Him; 

<p class="indent-2"> He covers the tops of the mountains. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Therewith He sustaineth the nations, 

<p class="indent-2"> And food in abundance He giveth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  He wrappeth His hands in the lightning, 

<p class="indent-2"> And biddeth it fly to its mark. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  His thunder announces His coming; 

<p class="indent-2"> His anger is kindled at wrong. 

<p class="c-num">[Job 37]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At this doth thy heart not tremble, 

<p class="indent-2"> And leap right out of its place? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Hark, hark to His voice tempestuous, 

<p class="indent-2"> To the roar that goes forth from His mouth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ’Neath the whole sky He letteth it loose, 

<p class="indent-2"> And His flash to the fringe of the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  In the wake of it roareth His voice, 

<p class="indent-2"> With His voice majestic He thunders; 

<p class="indent-1"> Nor holds He the lightnings back, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whensoever His voice is heard. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  God letteth us see His wonders; 

<p class="indent-2"> Great things beyond knowledge He doeth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For He saith to the snow, "Fall earthwards"; 

<p class="indent-2"> Likewise to His strong rushing rain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He sealeth up all mankind, 

<p class="indent-2"> That His work may be known of them all. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The beasts go into their lairs, 

<p class="indent-2"> And within their dens remain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The temptest comes out of its chamber, 

<p class="indent-2"> And out of its store-house the cold. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  By the breath of God ice is given, 

<p class="indent-2"> The broad waters lie in constraint. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with hail, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the cloud doth scatter His lightning. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  This way and that is darteth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Turning about by His guidance, 

<p class="indent-1"> Doings whate’er He commands it 

<p class="indent-2"> Over the face of His world, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Wether for curse and correction 

<p class="indent-2"> Or in mercy He sendeth it forth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Hearken to this, Job, stand still, 

<p class="indent-2"> And consider the wonders of God. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Dost thou know how God doeth His work; 

<p class="indent-2"> How He flashes the light of His cloud? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Dost thou know how the thick clouds are poised; 

<p class="indent-2"> How He pours down a flood when it thunders, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  What time thy garments grow hot 

<p class="indent-2"> From the south wind which laps earth in silence? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Like Him canst thou spread out the sky, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like Him canst thou spread out the sky, 

<p class="indent-1"> Which is strong as a molten mirror? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  How then shall we speak to Him? Tell me; 

<p class="indent-2"> For helpless are we in our darkness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Shall one cavil at Him when He speaketh? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or shall a man say that He errs? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now no man can look on the light, 

<p class="indent-2"> So dazzling bright in the sky, 

<p class="indent-1"> When the wind has passed over and cleared it, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And radiance comes out of the north; 

<p><p class="indent-1"> But the splendour of God – how terrible! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The Almighty we cannot find out. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Powerful is He and all-righteous, 

<p class="indent-2"> And justice He will not pervert. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For this cause ought mortals to fear Him: 

<p class="indent-2"> But the heart of conceit He despiseth. 

<h5>The Mystery of the Divine Wisdom</h5>

<h5>(As for Wisdom-whence cometh she?</h5>  Understanding-where hath she her home?) 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For a mine there is for the silver, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a place where the gold is refined. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Iron is taken from dust, 

<p class="indent-2"> And copper is smelted from stone. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Man explores the dark to its limits, 

<p class="indent-2"> Seeks stones fromthe blackest gloom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He breaketh a shaft through the ground; 

<p class="indent-2"> Forgotten, they hang without foothold; 

<p class="indent-2"> They swing to and fro far from men. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  From the surface of earth cometh bread, 

<p class="indent-2"> While, beneath, it is raked as by fire. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Her stones are the home of the sapphire; 

<p class="indent-2"> The dust thereof is gold. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He puts forth his hand on the rock; 

<p class="indent-2"> At their roots he o’erturneth the mountains. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10a]</span>  Channels he cuts in the rocks, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11a]</span>  And he bindeth the streams that they weep not. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10b]</span>  Each precious thing his eye seeth; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11b]</span>  He bringeth the secret to light. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But Wisdom – whence cometh she? 

<p class="indent-2"> Understanding – where hath she her home? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The pathway is strange to the vulture, 

<p class="indent-2"> Unseen by the eye of the hawk, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  By the sons of pride untrodden, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor ever by fierce lion skirted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The way to her no man knoweth; 

<p class="indent-2"> In the land of the living none finds her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The deep saith, "She is not in me"; 

<p class="indent-2"> And the sea saith, "She is not in me." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  No fine gold for her can be given, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor silver be paid as her price. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Not in Ophir gold can she be valued, 

<p class="indent-2"> In precious onyx or sapphire. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Gold and clear glass are no match for her, 

<p class="indent-2"> Jewels of gold no exchange for her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Speak no of coral or crystal; 

<p class="indent-2"> More precious than rubies is Wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The topaz of Cush is no match for her. 

<p class="indent-2"> In pure gold she cannot be valued. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But Wisdom – whence cometh she? 

<p class="indent-2"> Understanding – where hath she her home? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  She is hid from the eyes of all living, 

<p class="indent-2"> Concealed from the birds of the air. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Abaddon and Death declare, 

<p class="indent-2"> "A rumour of her we have heard." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But the way to her God understandeth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And He alone knoweth her home. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For He looks to the ends of the earth 

<p class="indent-2"> And all things under heaven He beholds. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  when He settled the weight of the wind 

<p class="indent-2"> And meted the waters by measure, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Created a law for the rain, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a path for the flash of the lightning, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Even then did He see and declare her, 

<p class="indent-2"> Establish and search her out. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And He said unto man, "Behold! 

<p class="indent-2"> The fear of Me – that is Wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And turning from wrong – Understanding." 

<h5>Two Wonderful Creatures of God</h5>

<h4>The Hippopotamus</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Behold now the huge beast beside thee: 

<p class="indent-2"> He eateth up grass like an ox. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Behold now the strength in his loins, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the force in the muscles of his belly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He holds his tail stiff as a cedar, 

<p class="indent-2"> His thighs are of sinews entwined. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  His bones are as tubes of brass, 

<p class="indent-2"> His limbs are like bars of iron. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He is chief of the ways of God, 

<p class="indent-2"> Made to lord it over his fellows. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The mountains yields him their fruits; 

<p class="indent-2"> All the wild beasts he grindeth to powder. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  There under the lotus he lies, 

<p class="indent-2"> In the covert of reed and fen, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Protected by shade of the lotus, 

<p class="indent-2"> Encircled by water-willows. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  From the wild rushing torrent he flees not; 

<p class="indent-2"> He is calm in the swell of a Jordan. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Who would venture to make for his eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or to pierce through his nose with a cord? 

<h4>The Crocodile</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Canst thou draw out the crocodile with hook, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or press his tongue down with a cord? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Canst thou put a rope into his nose, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or pierce his jaws through with a hook? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Will he make many prayers unto thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or will he speak softly to thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Will he make any tryst with thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> To be kept as thy servant for ever? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or attach him to string for thy maidens? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Shall the (fisher) guilds traffic in him? 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall the merchants divide him in pieces? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Canst thou fill his skin with barbs, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or his head with the fish-harpon? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Lay but thine hand upon him: 

<p class="indent-2"> Remember the battle – enough! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  See! thy hope is but an illusion; 

<p class="indent-2"> God hurleth the dread of him far. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Not one is so bold as to rouse him; 

<p class="indent-2"> Where is he that can stand before him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Who hath ever triumphantly braved him? 

<p class="indent-2"> Beneath the whole heaven, not one. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Of his limbs I will not keep silence, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of his strength and his mighty equipment. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Who can lay bare the face of his garment, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or enter the folds of his breastplate? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Who can open the doors of his face? 

<p class="indent-2"> Round about his teeth lieth terror.

<h5>Psalm 1 – The Way of Happiness</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Happy are those 

<p class="indent-2"> who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, 

<p class="indent-1"> not halting in ways frequented by sinners, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But the law of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is their joy, 

<p class="indent-2"> they study it day and night. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They are like trees 

<p class="indent-2"> planted by runlets of water,

<p class="indent-2"> In all that they do, they prosper.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Not so fare the wicked, not so; 

<p class="indent-2"> like chaff are they, blown by the wind. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For the way of the righteous is dear to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , 

<p class="indent-2"> but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

<h5>Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen King</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Why this turmoil of nations,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then he speaks to them in his wrath,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “This my king is installed by me, 

<p class="indent-2"> on Zion my holy mountain.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I will tell of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s decree. 

<p class="indent-1"> He said to me: “You are my son,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, 

<p class="indent-2"> and lord of the world to its utmost bounds. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You will break them with sceptre of iron, 

<p class="indent-2"> shatter them like pottery.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So now, you kings, be wise: 

<p class="indent-2"> be warned, you rulers of earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Serve the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in awe, 

<p class="indent-2"> kiss his feet with trembling, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;

<h1>PROVERBS</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 1]</p>

<h5>On the Worth of Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. 

<h5>The Aim of the Book</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  That people may learn wisdom and discipline, 

<p class="indent-2"> and understand words of discernment; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  that they may win training in prudence, 

<p class="indent-2"> in right and in justice and rectitude; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  that shrewdness be imparted to the simple, 

<p class="indent-2"> and knowledge and insight to youth – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  the wise too, who listens, will grow wiser, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the prudent more skilled in direction – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  that proverbs and parables may be plain, 

<p class="indent-2"> even the words of the wise and their riddles 

<h5>The Motto of the Book</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Reverence for the Lord is the basis of knowledge, 

<p class="indent-2"> but wisdom and discipline are scorned by fools. 

<h5>Exhortation and Warning</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Listen, my child, to your father’s instruction, 

<p class="indent-2"> and do not forsake what you mother has taught you; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  they will be a garland to your head, 

<p class="indent-2"> and a chain for your neck. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  My son, if sinners entice you, 

<p class="indent-2"> do not consent.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If they say, 

<p class="indent-1"> “Come with us, let us lurk for the blameless, 

<p class="indent-2"> and ambush the innocent for fun – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  let us swallow them up like the grave, alive 

<p class="indent-2"> and entire, just as those that go down to the pit. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Precious wealth of all sorts will be ours, 

<p class="indent-2"> we will fill our houses with spoil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Cast your lot with us; 

<p class="indent-2"> we will all share what we steal,” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do not go their way, my child. 

<p class="indent-2"> Keep your foot away from their path. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For their feet hasten to evil, 

<p class="indent-2"> and they rush to shed blood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The net is spread in the sight of the birds, 

<p class="indent-2"> who hungrily take the bait. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Their own is the blood they lurk for. 

<p class="indent-2"> Their own are the lives they ambush. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So end all who would grasp at gain – 

<p class="indent-2"> it destroys the life of its owner. 

<h5>The Appeal of Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Wisdom cries aloud in the streets, 

<p class="indent-2"> in the squares echoes her voice, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  she calls from the top of the walls, 

<p class="indent-2"> at the doors of the city gates she says: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “How long will you fools love folly, 

<p class="indent-2"> and scoffers delight in scoffing, 

<p class="indent-2"> and fools in their hatred of knowledge? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Respond to my rebuke. 

<p class="indent-2"> See! I speak my mind to you; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will tell you my thoughts. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Because you refused my call, 

<p class="indent-2"> gave no heed to my hand when it beckoned you, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  rejected all my counsel, 

<p class="indent-2"> and refused my admonition, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  when distress falls on you, I will laugh; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will mock, when your terror comes, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  when your terror comes as a storm, 

<p class="indent-2"> as a whirlwind your distress. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then I will not answer their call; 

<p class="indent-2"> they may seek, but they will not find me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Because they hated knowledge, 

<p class="indent-2"> and rejected the fear of the Lord, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  would have nothing of my counsel. 

<p class="indent-2"> but despised all my admonition, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  they must eat the fruit of their ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> and be filled with their own devices. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  By their own choice will the simple be slain. 

<p class="indent-2"> Prosperous ease will bring fools to destruction. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But he who listens to me will live securely, 

<p class="indent-2"> in a peace unruffled by fear of calamity.”           

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 2]</p>

<h5>The Blessed Fruits of Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My child, if you welcome my words, 

<p class="indent-2"> and hold close my commandments, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  giving heedful ear to wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> and bending your mind to reason; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  if you seek to invoke understanding. 

<p class="indent-2"> and lift up your voice to reason, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  seeking for her as if for silver, 

<p class="indent-2"> and searching for her as if for treasure: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  then the fear of the Lord will be plain to you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the knowledge of God you will find. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For the Lord is the giver of wisdom. 

<p class="indent-2"> The source of knowledge and insight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He stores up ability for the upright; 

<p class="indent-2"> he shields the blameless life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He guards the paths of the just, 

<p class="indent-2"> and he watches the way of the faithful. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then justice and right will be plain to you; 

<p class="indent-2"> you will keep to all paths that are good. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When wisdom will enter your mind, 

<p class="indent-2"> and in knowledge you find your pleasure, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  discretion will watch over you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and understanding will guard you, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and save you from wicked ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> from people of perverse speech, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  who leave the paths of right, 

<p class="indent-2"> to walk in ways of darkness – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  happy in doing wrong, 

<p class="indent-2"> exulting in wicked perverseness, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  all crooked in their paths. 

<p class="indent-2"> and devious in their ways. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  From the adultress too, it will save you, 

<p class="indent-2"> the sinning woman of slippery speech, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  who forsakes the partner of her youth, 

<p class="indent-2"> and forgets her bond with her God; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  for her house sinks down to death, 

<p class="indent-2"> and her paths lead to the place of the dead. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  None that visit her ever come back, 

<p class="indent-2"> or arrive at the paths of life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Therefore walk in the way of good people. 

<p class="indent-2"> Keep in the paths of the righteous, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for the upright will live in the land, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the blameless alone will enjoy it; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  while bad people are cut off from it. 

<p class="indent-2"> and the faithless uprooted. 

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 3]</p>

<h5>The Wisdom of Trusting and Honouring the Lord</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My son, do not forget my teaching, 

<p class="indent-2"> keep my commandments in mind; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  for a long and happy life 

<p class="indent-2"> and fulness of peace will they bring you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Let not kindness and faithfulness leave you. 

<p class="indent-2"> Bind them about your neck; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  so favour and good repute will you find 

<p class="indent-2"> alike with God and people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Trust the Lord with all your heart. 

<p class="indent-2"> Lean not on your own understanding: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  in all your ways acknowledge him, 

<p class="indent-2"> and he will smooth your paths. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Do not pride yourself on your wisdom; 

<p class="indent-2"> fear the Lord and turn from evil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then there will be health to your body, 

<p class="indent-2"> and refreshment to your bones. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If you honour the Lord with your wealth, 

<p class="indent-2"> with the first-fruits of all that comes in to you, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  your barns will be filled with corn, 

<p class="indent-2"> and with wine will your vats overflow.           

<h5>The Worth of Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Reject not, my son, the Lord’s chastening. 

<p class="indent-2"> Do not spurn His reproof. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, 

<p class="indent-2"> he reproves the child he delights in. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Happy those who find wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> they who obtain understanding. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For she brings a gain fairer than silver, 

<p class="indent-2"> a revenue better than gold. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  More precious is she than corals, 

<p class="indent-2"> and with her can no treasures compare. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In her right hand is long life, 

<p class="indent-2"> in her left are riches and honour. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Her ways are pleasant ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> and all her paths are peace. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  She is a tree of life to those who grasp her. 

<p class="indent-2"> Happy they who hold her fast. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The Lord by wisdom founded the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> by understanding established the heavens. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  By knowledge he broke up the deeps. 

<p class="indent-2"> and the clouds he made drip with dew.  ************* 

<h5>The Security that comes from Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Observe, my child, discretion and wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> let them never out of your sight; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  so will they be life to you. 

<p class="indent-2"> An ornament round your neck. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  You will then go your way securely. 

<p class="indent-2"> Without ever striking your foot. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  You will sit down unafraid, 

<p class="indent-2"> and your sleep will be sweet where you lie. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  You will fear no sudden terror, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor the tempest that falls on the wicked. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For the Lord is the ground of your hope. 

<p class="indent-2"> He will keep your foot from the snare. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Withhold from your neighbour no good 

<p class="indent-2"> Which you have in your power to do them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Do not tell them – when you can afford it – to go 

<p class="indent-2"> and come back, with the promise of something tomorrow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Devise no mischief against your neighbour, 

<p class="indent-2"> while they are trustfully living beside you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Do not idly quarrel with anyone 

<p class="indent-2"> who has not done you any harm. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Do not envy the violent, 

<p class="indent-2"> or choose any one of their ways. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  For the Lord abhors the crooked, 

<p class="indent-2"> but the upright are his friends. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The Lord’s curse rests on the house of the wicked. 

<p class="indent-2"> But the home of the righteous he blesses. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  As for him, he scoffs at scoffers, 

<p class="indent-2"> but he gives grace to the lowly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Wise men come to honour, 

<p class="indent-2"> but shame is the portion of fools. 

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 4]</p>

<h5>The Excellence and Beneficent Power of Wisdom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Listen, children, to a father’s instruction. 

<p class="indent-2"> Pay attention to gain understanding. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For the counsel I give you is good. 

<p class="indent-2"> Do not forsake my teaching. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When I was my father’s child, 

<p class="indent-2"> loved by my mother, and tender, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  he used to say, as he taught me, 

<p class="indent-2"> “Hold fast my words in your mind. 

<p class="indent-2"> Keep my commandments and live. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Get wisdom, get understanding. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  If you do not leave her, she will keep you; 

<p class="indent-2"> If you hold her dear, she will guard you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Prize her and she will exalt you 

<p class="indent-2"> and honour you if you embrace her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  She will set a fair wreath on your head 

<p class="indent-2"> and a glorious crown she will give you.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Listen, my son, and accept my words, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the years of your life will be many. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I teach you the way of wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> I guide you in honour’s paths. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  You will walk with steps unconstrained. 

<p class="indent-2"> You will run without ever stumbling. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Keep unceasing hold of instruction; 

<p class="indent-2"> Guard her, for she is your life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Do not enter the path of the wicked. 

<p class="indent-2"> Do now walk in the way of the evil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do not cross it, avoid it. 

<p class="indent-2"> Turn aside, and pass on. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For they do not sleep unless they have done some harm. 

<p class="indent-2"> They are sleepless until they have wrought some ruin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For the bread that they eat is won by crime, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the wine that they drink is procured by cruelty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The way of the wicked is through deep darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> Which hides from them that they stumble into; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  but the way of the just is like light of the morning, 

<p class="indent-2"> which shines more and more till the day is full. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  My son, listen to my words. 

<p class="indent-2"> Bend your ear to the things that I say. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Do not let them out of your sight. 

<p class="indent-2"> Keep them within your heart. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  They are life to those who find them, 

<p class="indent-2"> and health to all their being. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Guard your heart with all vigilance, 

<p class="indent-2"> for this is the way to life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Put away all crooked speech, 

<p class="indent-2"> and banish all devious talk. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Let your eyes look straight in front, 

<p class="indent-2"> and your eyelids right before you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Make a level path for your feet, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let all your ways be firm. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Do not turn to the right or the left. 

<p class="indent-2"> Keep your foot away from evil. 

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 5]</p>

<h5>The Wrong and Folly of Impurity</h5>

<p align="center">----</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My son, listen to wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> bend your ear to understanding; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  so that discretion may watch over you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and that knowledge may preserve you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For the lips of the harlot drop honey,

<p class="indent-2"> on the streets she has taken her stand. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  By the gates that lead into the city. 

<p class="indent-2"> She cries aloud at the portals:

<p class="indent-2"> You foolish ones, get to know wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  O listen, for grave is my message. 

<p class="indent-2"> And right all the speech of my lips. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It is truth that my mouth discourses, 

<p class="indent-2"> And falsehood my lips abhor. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  All the words that I utter are honest. 

<p class="indent-2"> Free from all that is crooked and tortuous, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  All clear to the man of sense, 

<p class="indent-2"> and right to those that have knowledge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Choose instruction, then, rather than silver, 

<p class="indent-2"> and more than choice gold welcome knowledge. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For better is Wisdom than corals; 

<p class="indent-2"> no treasures with her can compare.

<p class="indent-2"> or the first of the clods of the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  When He set up the heavens, I was there; 

<p class="indent-2"> when He vaulted the face of the deep; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When He made firm the skies above, 

<p class="indent-2"> and fixed the deep fast at its sources; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When He set to the sea its bounds, 

<p class="indent-2"> as He marked off the base of the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then beside Him was I as His nursling, 

<p class="indent-2"> and I was His daily delight, 

<p class="indent-2"> playing before Him at all times, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  playing about in His world. 

<p class="indent-2"> delighting in humankind.

<p class="indent-2"> daily watching at my gates, 

<p class="indent-2"> and waiting at my door-posts. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  For who finds me finds life, 

<p class="indent-2"> he wins the Lord’s own favour; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  but who misses me wrongs himself,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Treasures wrongly acquired profit nothing,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The Lord will not suffer the righteous to hunger, 

<p class="indent-2"> but He will frustrate the desire of the wicked. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  A slack hand creates poverty, 

<p class="indent-2"> but a diligent hand makes rich. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He that gathers in summer acts wisely; 

<p class="indent-2"> he that sleeps in harvest acts shamefully. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The blessing of God is on the head of the righteous, 

<p class="indent-2"> but sorrow will cover the face of the wicked. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The memory of the righteous is blessed, 

<p class="indent-2"> but the name of the wicked will rot. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  A wise man gives heed to commands, 

<p class="indent-2"> but a foolish talker will fall. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He whose life is blameless walks safely, 

<p class="indent-2"> but he who lives crookedly smarts for it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He who winks the eye makes trouble, 

<p class="indent-2"> but frank reproof makes peace.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Pride causes nothing but strife. 

<p class="indent-2"> but with those that take counsel is wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Wealth gathered in haste will diminish,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  An incompetent messenger ruins an enterprise, 

<p class="indent-2"> but a trustworthy envoy is healing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  To reject instruction spells shame and poverty,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Sweet is desire fulfilled,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He that walks with the wise will be wise, 

<p class="indent-2"> but the comrade of fools will smart for it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Sinners are chased by misfortune, 

<p class="indent-2"> but good overtakes the righteous. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The good man leaves wealth to his children’s children,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The ground of the poor yields food in abundance,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For a man to answer before he has heard

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  A man’s spirit sustains his weakness,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  A sensible mind acquires knowledge,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The first man to plead seems right,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  There are friends that seek nothing but company,

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 19]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Better a poor man whose life is blameless

<p class="indent-2"> much more do his friends stand aloof. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He loves his life who acquires wisdom,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  A false witness will not go unpunished; 

<p class="indent-2"> he that utters lies will perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A luxurious life for a fool is unseemly; 

<p class="indent-2"> much more for a servant to rule over princes. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  By forbearance a man shows his wisdom; 

<p class="indent-2"> to ignore an offence is his glory. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The wrath of a king is like the growl of a lion,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  A silly son is his father’s ruin,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To be kind to the poor is to lend to the Lord,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  A man’s kindness brings him return; 

<p class="indent-2"> better be poor than a cheat. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The fear of the Lord is the pathway to life,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When a scoffer is beaten, a simpleton learns,

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 20]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  In autumn the lazy man will not plough;

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Like the height of the heavens and the depth of the earth,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In the presence of a king claim not honour,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Do not hastily bring up a law-suit 

<p class="indent-2"> of something your eyes have seen.

<p class="indent-2"> and your infamy pass not away. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Like apples of gold in carvings of silver 

<p class="indent-2"> is a word that is fittingly spoken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Like an earring of gold and a necklace of fine gold 

<p class="indent-2"> is a wise man’s reproof to a listening ear. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Like a drink cooled by snow in the time of harvest 

<p class="indent-2"> is a faithful envoy to those that send him: 

<p class="indent-2"> he refreshes the soul of his master. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As clouds and wind that yet bring no rain,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  As the north wind brings forth rain,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  It is better to live on the roof in a corner 

<p class="indent-2"> than in a spacious house with a quarrelsome woman. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Like cool water to one that is weary 

<p class="indent-2"> is good news from a distant land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Like a fountain befouled or a ruined spring 

<p class="indent-2"> is a just man who falls before the wicked. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  It is not good to eat much honey;

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  To send a fool with a message 

<p class="indent-2"> is to cut off one’s feet and to drink disaster. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Like the limp legs of the lame 

<p class="indent-2"> is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Like a bundle of jewels on a heap of stones

<p class="indent-2"> and their insolence will be shattered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Like a dog that returns to his vomit, 

<p class="indent-2"> a fool repeats his folly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  If you see a man who thinks himself wise,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To mix in a quarrel not your own

<p class="indent-2"> and the wicked abhor the upright.

<h5>Collection of Brief Discourses and Aphorisms</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The words of Agur, son of Jakeh, the Massaite. Oracle of the man. 

<h5>The Weary World-Problem</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> I have wearied myself, O God; 

<p class="indent-2"> O God, I am weary and spent: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For dull as a brute am I, 

<p class="indent-2"> not a man with the mind of a man. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I have not learned wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> and nothing I know of the Holy One. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Who has climbed the heavens and come down? 

<p class="indent-2"> Who has gathered the wind in his fist? 

<p class="indent-1"> Who has tied in a garment the waters, 

<p class="indent-2"> or set up the bounds of the earth? 

<p class="indent-1"> What is his name, or his son’s name? 

<p class="indent-2"> for surely you know. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The words of God have all been tested, 

<p class="indent-2"> he shields those who take refuge in him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  To his words add you nothing at all, 

<p class="indent-2"> lest He should convict you of being a liar. 

<h5>A Prayer for Preservation alike from Wealth and Poverty</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For two things I entreat you; 

<p class="indent-2"> deny me not, before I die. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Put falseness and lying away from me; 

<p class="indent-2"> give me neither riches nor poverty, 

<p class="indent-2"> grant me the food I need; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  lest, if surfeited, I deny you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and say, “Who then is the Lord?” 

<p class="indent-1"> Or poverty drive me to steal, 

<p class="indent-2"> and profane the name of my God. 

<h5>Against Defamation</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  To a master defame not his servant, 

<p class="indent-2"> lest he curse you and you have to smart for it. 

<h5>Four Evil Types</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  There are those who curse their fathers, 

<p class="indent-2"> and leave their mothers unblessed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  There are others that think themselves pure, 

<p class="indent-2"> yet are all unwashed of their filthiness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There are others with haughty eyes 

<p class="indent-2"> and supercilious eyebrows. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  There are others whose teeth are swords – 

<p class="indent-2"> the teeth in their jaws are knives, 

<p class="indent-1"> to devour the poor from the earth. 

<p class="indent-2"> and the needy from off the ground. 

<h5>Four Insatiable Things</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  There are three things that never are satisfied – 

<p class="indent-2"> four that say never, “Enough!” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Sheol; the womb that is barren; 

<p class="indent-2"> the earth unsated with water; 

<p class="indent-2"> and fire that says never, “Enough!” 

<h5>Against Contempt of Parents</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The eye that mocks a father, 

<p class="indent-2"> and scornes an aged mother, 

<p class="indent-1"> will be picked by the crows of the valley 

<p class="indent-2"> and clean devoured by vultures. 

<h5>Four Mysterious Things</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Three things are too wonderful for me – 

<p class="indent-2"> four are beyond my knowledge: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  the way of a vulture in air, 

<p class="indent-2"> the way of a snake on a rock, 

<p class="indent-1"> the way of a ship on the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the way of a man with a woman. 

<h5>Four Intolerable Things</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Under three things the earth does tremble – 

<p class="indent-2"> four she cannot bear: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  A slave when he comes to the throne, 

<p class="indent-2"> a fool who has more than enough, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  a plain woman when she gets married, 

<p class="indent-2"> a maid that is heir to her mistress. 

<h5>Four Things Little but Wise</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Of the small things of earth there are four. 

<p class="indent-2"> and wiser they are than the wisest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  The ants are a feeble folk, 

<p class="indent-2"> yet they lay up their food in the summer. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  A feeble folk, too, are the conies, 

<p class="indent-2"> yet they make their house in the rocks. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The locusts again, though kingless, 

<p class="indent-2"> yet march, every one, in good order. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And a lizard you could crush in your hand 

<p class="indent-2"> finds her way into royal palaces. 

<h5>Four Stately Things</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Three creatures there are whose step is stately, 

<p class="indent-2"> four whose step is majestic – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The lion, most valiant of beasts, 

<p class="indent-2"> who in presence of foe never flinches; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The proud strutting cock and the he-goat, 

<p class="indent-2"> and a king who is head of his army. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Bluster you not in arrogance, 

<p class="indent-2"> but lay your hand on your mouth. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  As the churning of milk yields curd, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the wringing of the nose yields blood, 

<p class="indent-2"> so the churning of wrath yields strife. 

<p class="c-num">[Proverbs 31]</p>

<h5>Against Immorality and Intemperance</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, which his mother taught him. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  O son whom I bore, give heed to my words; 

<p class="indent-2"> and observe my sayings, you son of my vows. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Give not your strength to women, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor your love to those that slay kings. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Nor for kings is it right to drink wine, 

<p class="indent-2"> or for princes to long for strong drink; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Lest in drink they forget the law, 

<p class="indent-2"> and do wrong to the cause of the sorrowful. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But give drink to him who is perishing, 

<p class="indent-2"> and wine to the bitter in soul; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  so that in drink he forget his poverty, 

<p class="indent-2"> and think of his sorrow no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Open your mouth for the widow, 

<p class="indent-2"> do right by all fatherless children. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Open your mouth in just judgment. 

<p class="indent-2"> defend the poor and the needy. 

<h5>The Ideal Housewife</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A woman of worth who can find? 

<p class="indent-2"> Her price is far above corals. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To her her husband trusts, 

<p class="indent-2"> and finds no lack of gain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  She does him good and not harm 

<p class="indent-2"> all the days of his life. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  She looks out wool and flax. 

<p class="indent-2"> and works it up as she will. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Like the merchant-ships is she; 

<p class="indent-2"> she brings her food from afar. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  She rises while yet it is night, 

<p class="indent-2"> and gives her household food, 

<p class="indent-2"> and her maidens their portion appointed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  She examines a field and buys it; 

<p class="indent-2"> with her earnings she plants a vineyard, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  She girds her loins with strength, 

<p class="indent-2"> and with vigour she plies her arms. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  She perceives that her profit is good; 

<p class="indent-2"> her lamp never goes out in the night. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  She lays her hand on the distaff; 

<p class="indent-2"> her hand takes hold of the spindle. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  She stretches her hand to the poor, 

<p class="indent-2"> and her hand she extends to the needy. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  She fears not the snow for her household; 

<p class="indent-2"> her household are all clad in scarlet. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And coverlets she has made her; 

<p class="indent-2"> her raiment is linen and purple. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  In the gates is her husband well known, 

<p class="indent-2"> where he sits with the elders in council. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Linen she makes and sells; 

<p class="indent-2"> to the merchant she furnishes girdles. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  She is clothed with strength and glory; 

<p class="indent-2"> she laughs at the days to come. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Her mouth she opens in wisdom; 

<p class="indent-2"> kind counsel is on her tongue. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  She looks well to the ways of her household; 

<p class="indent-2"> she eats not the bread of idleness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Her children arise and bless her; 

<p class="indent-2"> her husband sings her praises: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “Many daughters have done nobly, 

<p class="indent-2"> but you excellest them all!” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Grace is deceptive, and beauty is transient. 

<p class="indent-2"> but a woman of character – she will be praised. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Give her then what her hands have earned, 

<p class="indent-2"> even the praise of her deeds in the gates.

<h1>ECCLESIASTES</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 1]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Discourses, by the Speaker, the son of David,  king of Jerusalem. 

<h4>The Futility and Monotomy of Nature and Of Human Life</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Utterest vanity! The Speaker declareth: 

<p class="indent-2"> Utterest vanity! All is vanity. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  What gain hath a man of all his toil 

<p class="indent-2"> Whereat he toileth under the sun? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The generations come and go, 

<p class="indent-2"> But evermore the earth abideth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The sun doth rise, and the sun doth set, 

<p class="indent-2"> But he panteth back to the place of his rising. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  South the wind goeth, and northward it circleth; 

<p class="indent-2"> Circling and circling goeth the wind, 

<p class="indent-2"> And back on its circling the wind returneth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  All the rivers run into the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> But nevertheless is the sea not full. 

<p class="indent-1"> To the place to which the rivers run, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thither they run and run for ever. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  All things are full or weariness, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of weariness unutterable, 

<p class="indent-1"> With all that it sees hath the eye no rest, 

<p class="indent-2"> And with all that it hears is the ear unfilled. 

<h4>The Futility of the Search after Knowledge</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  What has been, shall be; what has happened  already, will happen again: there is not a novelty  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  under the sun. When anything occurs that one is  disposed to call really new, it will be found to have  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  happened already – ages before us. Nobody  remembers (to-day) the people of the olden time,  and similarly the people of the after-time will not  be remebered by anybody who comes after them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I, the Speaker, was king over Israel in Jerusalem;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and I gave my mind to the philosophic study and  investigation of all that goes on under the sun. But  a sorry business it is that God has given men to  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  busy themselves with. From my observation of  all that goes on under the sun, I have come to the  conclusion that it is all nothing but an illusion and  a chasing of the wind.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  That which is crooked can never be straightened, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> And that which is lacking can never be counted. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then I said to myself, Let me take my own case.  I have amassed wisdom beyond all my predecessors  in Jerusalem, and my experience of wisdom and of  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  knowledge has been a wide one; but after applying  my mind to the study of wisdom and knowledge, madness  and folly, I am convinced that this also is a chasing of the wind; for  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Who is rich in wisdom is rich in vexation, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> And increase of knowledge brings increase of pain. 

<h4>The Futility of the Search after Pleasure</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I said to myself, Well now, I will experiment with  pleasure and indulge myself; but I discovered with  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Surprise that this, too, was an illusion. I concluded  that laughter was madness and joy a sterile thing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I turned over in my mind how to cheer my senses  with wine – preserving at the same time, however,  my habitual wisdom – and how to embrace folly,  until I should discover what satisfaction may be  procured by men under heaven during the days  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  of their brief lives. I went in for enterprises on an  impressive scale. I had houses built and vineyards  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  planted. I had gardens laid out and parks planted  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  with all sorts of fruit trees, I had reservoirs con-  structed to water the trees that formed the plan-  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  tations. I bought male and female slaves in addition  to the other that had been born in my house. I had  cattle and sheep in abundance – far beyond my  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  predecessors in Jerusalem. Further, I amassed  silver and gold and treasure from (tributary) kings  and from the provinces. I procured male and female  singers and sensuous delighs – concubines in  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  abundance; and richer and richer I grew beyond  all my predecessors in Jerusalem – taking care, how-  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  ever, to retain my wisdom. I refused my eyes  nothing that they longed for, and I did not abstain  from pleasure of any kind, for there was a pleasure  attached to all my effort, and the reward of all my  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  effort I found in that. But when I looked at all  the things my hands had made, and at the effort  that I had spent upon them, it all turned out to be  nothing but an illusion and chasing of the wind:  <span class="v-num">[12b]</span>  here was no profit under the sun. For what will  the king’s successor do but just what has been done  before? 

<h4>The Futility of Wisdom</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12a]</span>  Then I turned to the consideration of wisdom and  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  madness and folly, and I saw that wisdom is as  superior to folly as light to darkness; for  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  While the wise have their eyes in their head, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> The fool walketh in darkness.  Still, I am well aware that in their fate they are  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  both alike. So I said to myself, The fate of the fool  shall be my fate also; and what, in that case, am  I the better for my pre-eminent wisdom? So I  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  said to myself, Here is another illusion. For through  all time the wise man is not remembered any more  than the fool, seeing that in the days to come every  one will be soon forgotten. Alas! the wise man  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  dies just like the fool. So life became odious to  me, because I was vexed with all that goes on under  the sun; for it is all an illusion and a chasing of the wind, 

<h4>The Futility of Work</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Yes, all the effort that I had spent under the sun  became odious to me, because I should have to  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  leave it to my successor; and who can tell whether  it will be a wise man or a fool that will have the  disposal of the results of all my wise and earnest  toil under the sun? Here is another illusion. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then I felt like yielding to despair because  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  of all my laborious toil under the sun; for it  may happen that a man who has toiled with  wisdom, knowledge, and skill has to bequeath the  results of it to another who has done no work upon  it at all. Here, in this great evil, is another illusion.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For what does a man get from all the striving  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and the strain of his work under the sun? His days  are all a torture, and his business a vexation: why,  even the night brings no rest to his mind. Here is  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  another illusion. There is, then, no satisfaction for  a man beyond eating and drinking and enjoying  himself as he works. This I saw to be from God’s  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  own hand; for how can there be eating or enjoyment  apart form Him?  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For the man who pleases Him He gives wisdom,  knowledge and happiness; to the sinner, on the other  hand, He gives the task of gathering and amassing,  that it may be given (in the end) to the man who pleases  God.  Here is another illusion and chasing of the wind. 

<h4>The Futility of Human Effort in the Light of the Fixed</h4> Order of the World 

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 3]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Everything has its reason appointed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And every affair under heaven has its time. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  A time to be born, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to die. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to plant, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to uproot. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  A time to slay, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to heal. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to tear down, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to build up. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  A time to weep, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to laugh. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to mourn, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to dance. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  A time to scatter stones, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to clear them away. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to embrace, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to refrain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  A time to seek, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to lose. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to preserve, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to throw away. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A time to tear, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to sew. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time to be silent, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to speak. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  A time to love, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time to hate. 

<p class="indent-1"> A time for war, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a time for peace. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  What does the worker gain by all his toil (thought  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I) as I looked at the tasks that God has assigned  to men to busy themselves with?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  It is a beautiful orfer that He has established–  evrything at its appointed time. Besides, He has  planted in the human heart (the instinct for) eternity;  only men cannot discern the whole range – from begin-  ning to end – of the work which God is carrying on.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I am convinced that the only satisfaction that can  be theirs is to be happy and prosperous, while  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  they live. Besides, it is God’s own gift, when a man  is priviledged to eat, drink, and experience happiness  in all his work. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I am convinced that all that God does is eternal;  it is capable neither of increase nor of diminution:  and God has ordained this, in order to inspire men  with reverence. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Whatever is, has happened already; and what  is yet to happen, already is: for that which has  drifted (into the past) God seeketh out again. 

<h4>The Futility of Hoping for the Redress of Injustice in Some Future World</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Once more, in the course of my observation under  the sun, I saw that, in the place where judgments  were delivered, there was injustice – yes, injustice  in the very place where justice should have been  administered.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I said to myself, Yes, but God will judge the just and  the unjust: for He hath appointed a time for every  matter and for every act.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I said to myself, It is for men’s sake, that God  may show them in their true light, and lead them  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  to see that they are but beasts. For the fate of  men is the fate of beasts: their fate is one and the  same. The one dies like the other. One breath  is in them all, and man is no way superior to the  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  beasts. For all is but an illusion. All are on their  way to the same place. All sprang from the dust,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and to the dust they shall all return. Who can tell  whether the human spirit goes upward and the  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  spirit of the beast downward to the earth? So O  recognised that there is no greater satisfaction for  a mn that to be happy in his work – that is his  reward; for, as to what is to happen after him–  who can give him a glimpse of that? 

<h4>Man’s Inhumanity to Man</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Once more, I considered all the oppression that  goes on under the sun. I saw the tears of the  oppressed, who have no one to comfort them–  power brutally wielded by the oppressors, and not  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  a soul to comfort them. Happy, thought I, were  the dead who are already dead rather than the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  living who are still alive; but happier than either  the creature that has never been born, to look upon  the evil work that goes on under the sun. 

<h4>The Taint of Jealousy</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then I observed that all the laborious and skilful  work of men has its origin and issue in their jealousy  of one another. Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind. 

<h4>The Wisdom of Unambitious Quiet</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The fool foldeth his hands, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his own flesh he devoureth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Better a single handful of quiet, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a chasing of the wind. 

<h4>The Futility and Misery of Loneliness</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Here is another of the illusions that I have  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  observed under the sun. Take, for example, a  lonely man, with no one by his side – he has neither  son nor brother: yet he toils on endlessly; his  eye can never see money enough. "And yet, whom  am I toiling for, and beggaring myself to happi-  ness? "Here is another illusion, a sorry business  indeed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Two are better than one, for their toil is happily  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  rewarded. If, for example, one should fall, his  comrade helps him to his feet: but woe betide the  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  man who falls, with nobody to help him up. Again,  if two lie together, they get warm: but how can a man  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  get warm by himself? Again, while a solitary  man may be overpowered, two can stand up to an  assailant; while a cord that has three strands  is not lightly snapped. 

<h4>The Futility of Wisdom – An illustration</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  A Young man that is poor but wise is better than  a foolish old king who can no longer take a warning.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  There was one such who passed from prison to the  throne, though in the (old king’s) reign he had been  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  born poor; and I obseved that every man alive  that walketh under the sun supported his youthful  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  successor. Endless were the people who looked  up to him as leader; and yet in later years their  enthusiasm for him had vanished. Here is another  illusion and a chasing of the wind. 

<h4>Warnings against Insincerity and Rashness in the</h4> Discharge of Religious Duties 

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  walk warily, when you go to the house of God:  to participate in the worship with attentive ear is  better than the sacrifices offered by fools, who are  only versed in the practice of wickedness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Do not be rash with your tongue, and do not let  your feelings hurry you into speech before God:  for God is in heaven, while you are on earth; your  words ought therefore to be few. For  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  As dreams proceed from multiplied cares, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> So the din of fools from multiplied words.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When you make a vow to God, pay it without  delay; for fools incur His displeasure. Pay  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  therefore what you vow. Better not vow than vow  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and not pay. Do not allow your tongue to involve  you in guilt and punishment; and do not have to  explain to the official that it was a case of inadver-  tence (on your part). Why should you say things  that must provoke God to bring your enterprises  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  To ruin? for multiplied dreams and words bring  multiplied vanities. But hold God in reverence. 

<h4>The Prevalence of Oppression</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Do not be astonished when you see a poor man  crushed, or right and justice plundered in a pro-  vinced; for high officials are perpetually spying upon  one another, and over them are others higher  still. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It is in every way an advantage to a land to  have a king devoted to the cultivation of the soil. 

<h4>The Futility of Wealth</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Who loves money can never have money enough, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the lover of riches no increase can satisfy. 

<p class="indent-1"> Here is another illusion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Increase of wealth bringeth increase in those that consume it: 

<p class="indent-2"> What gain hath is owner save gazing on it with his eyes? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Sweet is the sleep of the toiler, whether he eat  much or little; but the satiety of the wealthy  man will not let him sleep. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  One of the grievous evils that I have observed  under the sun is this – wealth hoarded up to its  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  owner’s ruin. The wealth vanishes in some sorry  adventure; and so, after becoming a father, he  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  finds himself with nothing at all. Naked as he  came from his mother’s womb must he go again,  just as he came. For all his toil he can take  nothing away with him that he can carry in his  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  hand. This also is a grievous evil, that he must go  away just as he came; and what has he gained  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  by toiling for the wind? Yes, all his days are  spent in darkness and mourning, in deep vexation,  sickness and anger. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I claim, as the result of my observation, that it  is an excellent and comely thing (for a man) to eat,  drink, and enjoy himself amid all his laborious  toil under the sun during the days of the brief life  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  which God gives him: for that is his lot. Yes,  when God gives a man wealth and riches and power  to enjoy them, to take his share and be happy in  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  his work – this is a gift of God. Such a man will  not think much about the brevity of his life; for  his heart is touched by God to a glad response. 

<h4>The Futility of Wealth the Power to Enjoy</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One of the vexatious things that I have seen under  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the sun to press heavily upon men is this. Take  the case of a man to whom God has given wealth,  riches, honour, everything heart can desire except  the opportunity to enjoy it– that opportunity falling  to some stranger. Here is a grieveous and painful  illusion. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  If a man be the father of a hundred sons, and live  for many long years, but without having enjoyed  any true satisfaction from his prosperity and without  the honour of burial (in the end), then such a man,  I maintain, is not so fortunate as an untimely  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  birth, which, coming as a futility, departs in dark-  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ness with its name enveloped in darkness, never  having has sight or knowledge of the sunlight.  It is this, rather than the other, that enjoys rest.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Though the man should live a thousand years twice  over, yet enjoy no experience of happiness, are not  both on their way to same place? 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The toil of man is all for his mouth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yet the appetite is unfilled. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  What gain hath the wise man more than the fool, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or the poor man who walks through the world with discretion? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Better a glimpse with the eyes 

<p class="indent-2"> Than the roaming of the appetite. 

<p class="indent-1"> Here is another illusion and a chasing of the wind. 

<h4>The Futility of the Struggle with Destiny</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The character of what is has already been deter-  mined, and the destiny of man is already fore-  ordained: he cannot contend with one mightier  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  than himself. For multiplied words mean but  multiplied vanities; and what is man the better?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Who can tell what is good for man during his life-  time all the days of the brief and empty life that he  passes like a shadow? Who can declare to a man  what is to happen after him under the sun? 

<h4>Counsels for Conduct</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 7]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A fair name is better than precious ointment, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the day of death the day of one’s birth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It is better to go the house of mourning 

<p class="indent-2"> Than to go to the banquetting-house; 

<p class="indent-1"> Inasmuch as that is the end of all men, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the living should lay it to heart. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Vexation is better than laughter; 

<p class="indent-2"> For, when the face is sad, it is well with the heart. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, 

<p class="indent-2"> But the heart of the fool in the house of mirth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise 

<p class="indent-2"> Than to lend one’s ears to the song of a fool. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For like crackling of nettles under kettles, 

<p class="indent-2"> Even so is the cackle of fools. 

<p class="indent-1"> Here is another illusion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Extortion maketh the wise man mad, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a bribe destroyeth the character. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The end of a thing is better than the beginning, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the patience is better than pride. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Do not be hastily vexed in thy temper; 

<p class="indent-2"> Vexation doth lodge in the bosom of fools, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Say not, "Why were the former days better than these?" 

<p class="indent-2"> For such a question is not of wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As good as an inheritance is wisdom. 

<p class="indent-2"> And gainful to those who behold the sun. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Wisdom defends, even as money defends; 

<p class="indent-2"> But herein is the greater gain of knowledge, 

<p class="indent-2"> That a wisdom is life unto those that possess her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Consider well the work of God; 

<p class="indent-2"> For who can make straight that which He hath made crooked? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In happy days be happy, and in the day of misfor-  tune consider: for God has balanced the one against  the other, in order to prevent men from discovering  anything of the future. 

<h4>The Folly of Extremes</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  In the course of my illusory life I have witnessed  all sort of things – honest men ruined by their  very honesty, and unprincipled men who owe their  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  long life to their very lack of principle. Do not  be over-pious or over-wise: why court destruction?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But neither be over-wicked, nor play the fool:  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  why die before your time? It is good, while cling-  ing to the one, not to relax your grasp of the  other; for true religion avoids the excesses of  both. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Wisdom is a mightier protector to the wise than  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  ten men who are in authority over a city. For  there is not a single righteous man upon earth–  a man who does nothing but good and never falls  into sin. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Further, pay no attention to current gossip, in  case you may hear that your servant has cursed  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  you; for your conscience tells you that you too  hace cursed others many a time. 

<h4>Woman a Delusion and a Snare</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  I subjected all this to the test of wisdom. I resolved  to acquire wisdom, but she remained remote.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Yes, the essence of things remained remote – deep  down in depths unfathomable. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then, casting about, I gave my mind to the  understanding and investigation of wisdom, to  search after her for results, and to study the folly  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  of wickedness and the madness of folly. And a  thing that I find to be more bitter than death is  woman: for she is a veritable net, with her heart  of snares and her hands of fetters. The man who  enjoys the favour of God escapes her, but the sinner  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  is caught by her. Now mark this, says the Speaker.  Putting one thing with another in order to arrive  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  at a conclusion – which, however, I have long and  earnestly sought in vain – this at least I have dis-  covered: that there is one man in a thousand–  that I have discovered – but never a woman in all  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  that number have I found. This only have I  found-mark it well: that men were created  upright by God, but they have sought out many  contrivances of their own. 

<h4>Reflections upon Despotism</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 8]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Who is like the wise man? 

<p class="indent-2"> Who is skilled in interpretation? 

<p class="indent-1"> A man’s wisdom illumines his face, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a face that is harsh is transfigured.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Obey the king’s commands; but, remembering  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  your oath to God, do not be drawn into hasty  action. Leave his presence, and do not embark  upon any hurtful course; for a king can do any-  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  thing he pleases, seeing that his royal word is  authorative, and his conduct unchallengeable. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He who keeps the commandment will never  come to harm. The wise man knows in his heart  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  that there is an hour of judgment; for everything  has its hour for judgment – and men will be crushed  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  beneath the weight of calamity. For they are  ignorant of the future: who can tell what form it  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  will take? No man can control the day of his  death, any more than he can control or restrain  the wind. In war there is no discharge. Wrong  will secure no immunity for the wrong-doer. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  All this I saw, as I applied my mind to all that  goes on under the sun, at a time when men were  wielding their power over other men to ruin  them. 

<h4>The Futility of Looking for a Moral Order in this World,</h4> and there is No Other 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Thereafter I saw wicked men borne to the tomb  from the holy place – men who usde to go about  amid plaudits in the very city where they had so  behaved. Here is another illusion.  <span class="v-num">[11f]</span>  Because sentence is not swiftly executed upon deeds  of wickedness, but a sinner may enjoy a long life thought  he do evil a hundred times over, men’s hearts swell  with the impulse to do evil; though sure I am that it  will be well with those who fear God – I mean those  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  who really reverence Him – but it will not be well with  the wicked: his life will be short as a shadow, because  he has no reverence for God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Here is another of the anomalies to be found upon  the earth – honest meb who fare as if they had been  scoundrels, and scoundrels who fare as if they had  been honest men. Here, methought, is another  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  futility. Then I commended mirth – for the only  human satisfaction under the sun is to eat, drink,  and be merry: these are the things that should  accompany men during the days of the laborious  life with God has given them under the sun. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When I gave my mind to the study of wisdom  and to the observation of the business that is trans-  acted in the world – for day and night one never  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  gets a glimpse of sleep – then I recognised that man  is impotent to discover the meaning of all the work  of God that goes on under the sun. However  laboriously men search, they will never discover  it. A wise man may imagine he is on the point of  understanding it, but he can never find it out. 

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 9]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For all this I laid to heart, and my heart observed  it all, that the just, the wise, and their doings are  in the hand of God: no man knows whether it is  to be love or hatred. All that lies ahead of them is  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  vapour, inasmuch as the fate of all is alike – of  saint and scoundrel, good and bad, pure and impure,  those who do and those who do not practise sacrifice.  Good man and sinner fare alike, those who take  oaths and those who are afraid to take them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  This is one of the vexing things that go on uni-  versally under the sun, that the fate of all is alike.  Besides, the human heart is full of evil: all their  life long, madness is in men’s heart, and thereafter  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  they join the dead – not a man is left. There is  hope for all who are in life– a live dog even is  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  better than a dead lion- for the living know at  least that they have to die, but the dead have no  knowledge at all, and no further reward is possible  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  for them – their very memory is forgotten. Their  love, hatred, jealousy, all alike have already  vanished, and for all time they have no share in  anything that goes on under the sun. 

<h4>The Wisdom of Enjoyment</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Go and eat thy bread with joy, 

<p class="indent-2"> And drink thy wine with a merry heart; 

<p class="indent-2"> For what thou doest is God’s good pleasure. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  At all times let thy raiment be white, 

<p class="indent-2"> And let not oil on thy head be lacking. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Enjoy thy life with the woman thou lovest, 

<p class="indent-2"> All the days of thy fleeting life, 

<p class="indent-2"> Which He hath given thee under the sun. 

<p class="indent-1"> For that is thy reward in thy life of laborious toil 

<p class="indent-1"> under the sun. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[Do]</span>  with thy might whatever thou hast in thy  power to do; for nothing can be done or devised,  known or apprehended, in the under-world to which  thou art going. 

<h4>The Element of Chance in Life</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Once more: I observed that under the sun it is  not the swift that win the race, nor the strong that  conquer in battle, neither is wisdom rewarded with  bread, nor insight with wealth, nor intellect with  practical appreciation; all alike are the victims of  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  time and chance. Nobody knows his hour. Men are  like fish caught in a net, or birds in a trap. Like  them men are caught in the meshes in an evil hour,  when suddenly it falls upon them. 

<h4>The place of Wisdom in Popular Esteem</h4> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The following illustrations of wisdom came under  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  my notice, and it greatly impressed me. There was  a small and thinly garrisoned town, which a power-  ful king came and invested by building huge  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  siege-works against it. But there happened to be  in it a man, poor indeed, but endowed with a wisdom  which enabled him to save the town. Not a soul,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  However, remembered this poor man. So, me-  thought, wisdom of a poor man is held in contempt, and his  words are not listened to.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Better wise words that are heard in quiet 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Than the shrieking of one who is lord among fools. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Better is wisdom than weapons of war, 

<p class="indent-2"> For one single blunder may ruin much good. 

<h4>A Topsy-Turvy World</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Ecclesiastes 10]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Under the sun this evil I have seen, 

<p class="indent-2"> As ’twere the blundering order of a Ruler: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The fool is set upon a lofty height, 

<p class="indent-2"> While men of wealth must take a lowly seat. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Slaves have I seen upon horse-back, 

<p class="indent-2"> And princes walking like slaves on the ground. 

<h4>A Collection of Proverbs</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As a deadly fly causes stench in the perfumer’s ointment, 

<p class="indent-2"> So a little folly can ruin the rarest wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The sense of a wise an leads him to the right, 

<p class="indent-2"> But the sense of a fool to the left. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  As he goes on his way, a fool showeth his lack of sense; 

<p class="indent-2"> And every one saith of him, "There goes a fool." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  If a ruler flare up in a passion against thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Quit not thy post: for composure 

<p class="indent-2"> Can lull mighty passions to rest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He that diggeth a pit may fall therein, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a serpent may bite him that breaks through a wall; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He that quarrieth stones may be hurt by them, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the man who cleaves wood is imperilled thereby. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  If the iron be blunt, and you whet not its edge, 

<p class="indent-2"> You must use more strength. 

<p class="indent-2"> He succeeds who can claim the advantage of wisdom. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If a serpent bite for lack of enchantment, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then the skillful charmer hath no advantage. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The words of a wise man’s mouth win him favour, 

<p class="indent-2"> But a fool by his lips is brought to ruin; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  From the first the words of his mouth are folly, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the end of his speech is calamitous madness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The fool maketh many words. 

<p class="indent-2"> Man knoweth not the future; 

<p class="indent-1"> And what shall happen after him, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who can declare unto him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The fuss of fools must weary the man 

<p class="indent-2"> Who does not know his way to the town. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Alas for thee, land! when thy king is a youth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy princes feast in the early morning; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But hail to thee, land! when thy king is a noble, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy princes feast at the proper season, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like men and not like sots. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Through idleness the roof sinks in, 

<p class="indent-2"> And through slackness of hands does the house fall a-leaking. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Feasts are made for mirth,

<p class="indent-2"> And curse not the rich in thy sleeping-chamber;

<p class="indent-2"> Never gets to his reaping. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor how the child grows in the womb of the mother,

<h4>The Vineyard with the Wild Grapes</h4>

<h5>The Song of the Vineyard</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 5]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A song will I sing of my friend, 

<p class="indent-2"> a love-song touching his vineyard. 

<p class="indent-1"> A vineyard belonged to my friend, 

<p class="indent-2"> on a fertile hill-top he had set it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He had dug it and cleared it of stones, 

<p class="indent-2"> and choice vines therein he had planted. 

<p class="indent-1"> A tower he had built in the midst, 

<p class="indent-2"> and a winepress therein he had hewn. 

<p class="indent-1"> Then he looked for a yield of good grapes, 

<p class="indent-2"> but the grapes that it yielded were wild. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now judge, you that dwell in Jerusalem, 

<p class="indent-2"> and you that are freemen of Judah, 

<p class="indent-2"> judge between me and my vineyard. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  What more could I do for my vineyard 

<p class="indent-2"> that I had neglected to do? 

<p class="indent-1"> And why, when I looked for good grapes, 

<p class="indent-2"> did it yield only grapes that were wild? 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So now let me give you to know 

<p class="indent-2"> what I purpose to do my vineyard. 

<p class="indent-1"> I will tear off its hedge, that the beasts may devour it; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will break through its wall, that they trample it down. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I will make it waste, all unpruned and unweeded, 

<p class="indent-2"> with thorns and with briars overgrown shall it be, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the clouds I will order to withhold from it rain. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For the vineyard of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts is the household of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> the freeman of Judah His cherished plantation. 

<p class="indent-1"> But instead of the justice He looked for was bloodshed, 

<p class="indent-2"> instead of the right was the cry (of the wronged). 

<h5>The National Sins: Woe!</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Woe unto you who join house unto house 

<p class="indent-2"> and who add one field to another, 

<p class="indent-1"> till no one has room but you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and you settle the land by yourselves. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts in mine ear has whispered, 

<p class="indent-1"> surely many a great fine house 

<p class="indent-2"> shall be desolate and empty, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but eight gallons, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the harvest shall be but one tenth of the seed. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Woe unto them that rise early 

<p class="indent-2"> to give themselves to drink, 

<p class="indent-1"> and to those that sit late in the evening, 

<p class="indent-2"> inflaming themselves with wine; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Whose banquets of wine are enlivened 

<p class="indent-2"> with lute, harp, timbrel, and flute; 

<p class="indent-1"> but all blind to the work of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , 

<p class="indent-2"> they see not the things He is doing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore all unaware shall My people 

<p class="indent-2"> be swept into exile afar – 

<p class="indent-1"> Their nobleman dying of hunger, 

<p class="indent-2"> their populace parched with thirst. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore Sheol with ravenous throat 

<p class="indent-2"> opens wide her jaws without measure. 

<p class="indent-1"> And down shall her splendour go, 

<p class="indent-2"> and her noisy tumultuous rabble, 

<p class="indent-2"> with all that in her was exultant. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And there shall lambs graze as at pasture, 

<p class="indent-2"> and fatlings shall feed in her ruins. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thus through judgment the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts is exalted, 

<p class="indent-2"> the holy God shows Himself holy by righteousness. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Woe unto those that draw penalty on 

<p class="indent-2"> by their sin, as by stout wagon-ropes drawn by oxen; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  That say, “Let Him haste, let Him act with speed, 

<p class="indent-2"> in order that we may see it; 

<p class="indent-1"> let the purpose of Israel’s Holy One come 

<p class="indent-2"> so near that we recognize it.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Woe unto those that call evil good, 

<p class="indent-2"> and good evil; 

<p class="indent-1"> to those that turn light into darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> and darkness to light; 

<p class="indent-1"> to those that turn sweet into bitter, 

<p class="indent-2"> and bitter to sweet. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Woe unto those that esteem themselves wise, 

<p class="indent-2"> and that fancy themselves to be prudent. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Woe unto those that are valiant in wine-drinking, 

<p class="indent-2"> warriors brave at the mingling of drink; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Whom a bribe will induce to acquit the guilty, 

<p class="indent-2"> and innocent men to deprive of their rights. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  As fire licks up the stubble, 

<p class="indent-2"> and hay is shrivelled in flame, 

<p class="indent-1"> so their root shall turn to rottenness, 

<p class="indent-2"> and their blossom go up in dust; 

<p class="indent-1"> because they rejected the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s instruction, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the message of Israel’s Holy One scorned. 

<h5>A Foreign Army is Coming</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So against His people His anger was kindled, 

<p class="indent-2"> against them He stretched forth His hand and He smote them; 

<p class="indent-1"> the mountains shook, and the dead 

<p class="indent-2"> lay like refuse about the streets. 

<p class="indent-1"><i> For all this His anger is not turned back, 

<p class="indent-2"> but His hand is stretched out still. </i>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  To a far-distant nation He raises His signal, 

<p class="indent-2"> and whistles for them from the end of the earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> See! hastily, swiftly they come – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  None weary, none stumbling among them, 

<p class="indent-2"> unsleeping and slumbering never: 

<p class="indent-1"> The band of their loins never loosed, 

<p class="indent-2"> the thong of their shoes never torn. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Their arrows are sharp, 

<p class="indent-2"> and their bows are all bent: 

<p class="indent-1"> The hoofs of their horses are counted as flint, 

<p class="indent-2"> and their wheels as the whirlwind. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Their roar is like that of a lioness, 

<p class="indent-2"> and like the young lions they roar, 

<p class="indent-1"> growling and seizing the prey, 

<p class="indent-2"> and bearing it far beyond rescue. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  That day they shall roar over him,

<h4>The Prophet’s Call</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the year that King Uzi died, I had a vision of the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the skirts if His robe filled the Temple. Before Him were standing seraphs, each with six wings – two for covering the face, two the loins, and two  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  to fly with; and thus they kept calling to one another: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Holy, holy, holy, is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts; 

<p class="indent-2"> the whole earth is filled with His glory.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  At the sound of their calling the foundations of threshold shook, and the House began to fill  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  with smoke. Then I said 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Woe is me, for I am undone; 

<p class="indent-1"> for a man of unclean lips am I, 

<p class="indent-2"> and I dwell in a nation of unclean lips; 

<p class="indent-1"> and yet mine eyes have seen 

<p class="indent-2"> the King, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which with tongs he had taken  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  from off the altar. With this he touched my mouth, and said, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “See, this has touched your lips: 

<p class="indent-2"> Your guilt is past and your sin forgiven.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then I heard the voice of the Lord, 

<p class="indent-2"> saying, “Whom shall I send? who will go for us?” 

<p class="indent-2"> And I said, “Here am I, send me.” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then He said, “Go and say to this people 

<p class="indent-1"> ’Hear ever, but understand never; 

<p class="indent-2"> see ever, but comprehend never.’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Make the people’s minds dull, 

<p class="indent-2"> block their ears and cover their eyes, 

<p class="indent-1"> lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears, 

<p class="indent-2"> and their minds understand, and their health come again.” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then I said, “Till cities lie wasted, 

<p class="indent-2"> with not an inhabitant left; 

<p class="indent-1"> till houses hold men no more, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the land is left a desolation; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  till the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  removes men afar 

<p class="indent-2"> and wide tracts of the land lie forsaken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And should there be in it a tenth still left, 

<p class="indent-2"> that too, in its turn, must be given to the fire, 

<p class="indent-2"> like the stump of an oak or a terebinth felled.” 

<h4>The Crisis Created by the Menace to Judah in 735 B.C.</h4>

<h5>The Prophet’s World to the Terrified King</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the days Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, Rezin King of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched against Jerusalem to attack it: but they were unable to develop an actual assault upon it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When news reached the Court that the Aramean army was on Ephraimite soil, the heart of Ahaz and his people shook like forest-trees before the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  wind. Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to Isaiah, “Go out– you and your son Shear-yashub – to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Fuller’s Field Road, and say to him: Be careful to keep calm: be not faint-hearted or afraid of this pair of fire-brands that are nothing but smoking stumps. Be not afraid of the fierce anger of Rezin  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Aram and Ephraim with the son of Remaliah have indeed  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  plotted your ruin: their purpose is to invade Judah, and, after reducing her straits, to break into (Jerusalem); then, having overpowered her, they purpose to set the son of Tabeelon the throne. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But thus says the Lord the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> : 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ’This thing shall not succeed, 

<p class="indent-2"> it shall not come to pass. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For the head of Aram is Damascus, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the head of Damascus is Rezin; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The head of Ephraim is Samaria, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. 

<p class="indent-1"> Your faith must firmly hold, 

<p class="indent-2"> if you would yourselves be held.’” 

<h5>The Great Refusal and the Sign</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  One more I addressed Ahaz thus, “Ask the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  your God for a sign – ask it (if you like) either from the depths of the under-world or from the heights above.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “No,” replied Ahaz, “I will not ask for one: that would be equivalent to submitting the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to a test.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then I said, “Hear then, you household of David. Is not enough for you to weary mortal men that you must weary my God as well?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  You shall have a sign therefore from the Lord Himself. Behold! 

<p><p class="indent-1"> A maid is with child, she shall bring forth a son, 

<p class="indent-2"> and shall call his name Immanuel. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Honey and curd shall he eat, 

<p class="indent-2"> when he knows how to choose what is good, 

<p class="indent-2"> and to shun what is evil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For ere the child shall know 

<p class="indent-2"> how to choose what is good 

<p class="indent-2"> and to shun what is evil, 

<p class="indent-1"> that land shall be deserted 

<p class="indent-2"> whose two kings you so dreaded. 

<h5>Judah shall also be Ravaged</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  shall bring upon you your people 

<p class="indent-2"> and on your father’s house 

<p class="indent-1"> such days as have never yet been, 

<p class="indent-2"> since Ephraim departed from Judah 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  That day it shall come to pass 

<p class="indent-1"> that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  shall whistle for the flies and the bees. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They shall come every one, and then down they 

<p class="indent-2"> shall settle 

<p class="indent-1"> in the steep-walled ravines and in clefts of the rocks, 

<p class="indent-2"> and on all thorn-hedges and places of pasture. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  That day shall the Lord shave bare 

<p class="indent-2"> with a razor that is hired 

<p class="indent-2"> in the land beyond the River 

<p class="indent-1"> both the head and hidden hair; 

<p class="indent-2"> and the beard too shall be snipped. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And in that day shall a man 

<p class="indent-2"> keep but two sheep and a cow; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Yet the plenteous yield of milk 

<p class="indent-2"> shall supply him fare of curd. 

<p class="indent-1"> For the fare of every man 

<p class="indent-2"> that is left upon the land 

<p class="indent-2"> shall be nought but curd and honey. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And in that day every spot 

<p class="indent-2"> where were once a thousand vines, 

<p class="indent-1"> worth a thousand silver pieces, 

<p class="indent-2"> shall with thorns and briers be covered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  With bow and with arrow shall men come thither, 

<p class="indent-2"> for all the land shall be thorns and briers. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Fear of thorns and briers shall hold men afar 

<p class="indent-2"> from the hills that used to be hoed with the hoe. 

<p class="indent-2"> There cattle shall wander and sheep shall tread. 

<h5>The Fall of Damascus and Samaria</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write upon it in the common script ’Speed-spoil  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Hurry-prey;’ and take (two) reliable witnesses,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” Then after the prophetess, through my approach to her, had conceived and borne a son, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to me, “Call his name Speed-spoil Hurry-prey. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For ere the child shall know 

<p class="indent-2"> how to cry ’My farther! My mother!’ 

<p class="indent-1"> The wealth of Damascus, the spoil of Samaria, 

<p class="indent-2"> shall be carried away to the king of Assyria.” 

<h5>The Invasion of Judah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Once more I had a message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  – it was this: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “Because this people has spurned 

<p class="indent-2"> the gentle stream of Shiloah, 

<p class="indent-1"> and melt with fear of Rezin 

<p class="indent-2"> and the son of Remaliah, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore, behold, the Lord 

<p class="indent-2"> will speedily bring upon them 

<p class="indent-1"> the waters of the River, 

<p class="indent-2"> the great and mighty River 

<p class="indent-1"> it shall rise above all its channels, 

<p class="indent-2"> and overflow all its banks. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  On it shall sweep over Judah, 

<p class="indent-2"> an overflowing flood

<h5>Isaiah’s Patient Hope</h5>

I will patiently wait for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who hides His face from the  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  household of Israel; I will set my hope in Him.

<h5>The Awful Plight of Unbelieving Judah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When they tell you have recourse to ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and mutter, ask them if a nation should not rather have recourse to its God.

<h5>The Great Deliverance and the Glorious King</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the former time He brought the territory of Zebulon and Naphtali into contempt, but in the latter time has He covered with glory the ground held by the nations beyond the Jordan on the way to the sea.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The Lord sent a word into Jacob,

<p class="indent-1"> The sycamores are cut down,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So against them the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has stirred up their foes,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But the people turned not unto Him that smote them, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor did they resort to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The elders and men of repute are the head,

<p class="indent-2"> devoured on the left, unappeased; 

<p class="indent-1"> no man did pity his fellow,

<p class="indent-1"><i> Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,

The land of Judah shall be a terror to her; the very mention of the name shall fill her with dread at the thought of the purpose which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts has formed against her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  In that day there shall be in the land of Egypt five cities speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing allegiance to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts; and one of them shall be called the City of the Sun. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  In that day there shall be an altar to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  in the heart of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  at the border. It shall be a sign and a witness to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts in the land of Egypt: for when, under oppression, they cry to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to send a deliver, He will intervene and rescue  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  them. And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will reveal Himself to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall acknowledge the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  on that day: they shall worship Him with sacrifice and offering, they shall make vows to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and discharge them. the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will smite  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Egypt – smite and heal her: when they turn to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , He will heal them in answer to their entreaty. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  In that day there shall be a highway between Egypt and Assyria; Assyrians will come to Egypt, And Egyptians to Assyria: Egyptians and Assyrians shall worship (the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ) in common.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  In that day Israel will join Egypt and Assyria in a triple alliance, and so bring blessing to the world  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  around, which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts has in these words blessed: ‟Blessed be Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.” 

<h4>Warning against the Folly of an Alliance with Egypt</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 20]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At that time Isaiah the son of Amoz received a message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , bidding him go and take the sackcloth from his loins and the sandals from his feet; and this he did, going about without  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  mantle of shoe. Then in the year that the Tartan, who had been despatched by Sargon King of Assyria,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  came to Ashdod and took it by storm, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, ‟Just as My servant Isaiah has gone for three years without mantle of shoe for a sign and a symbol to  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Egypt and Ethiopia, so shall the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, be led away by the King of Assyria – without mantle or  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  shoe, and with buttocks exposed. Then those who had looked with hope to Ethiopia and made their boast of Egypt, shall be put to shame and dismay  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And in that day the people who live in the coast-land shall say, ’If this be the fate of those to whom we had fled in expectation of help and deliverance from the King of Assyria, how can  <i> we </i>  escape?”

<p class="indent-2"> shall never reach unto us; 

<p class="indent-1"> for a lie we have made our refuge,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore thus says the Lord the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Your league with Death shall be clean disannulled,

<p class="indent-2"> and the word, grasped at last, shall bring nothing but terror.

<h4>The Character and Fate Jerusalem</h4>

<h5>The Fate of Jerusalem</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 29]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,

<p class="indent-1"> Let one or two years pass by,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I will camp, like David, against you,

<p class="indent-2"> and your words from the dust shall rise humbly

<p class="indent-2"> shall be as a dream, as a vision of night. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Like a man that is hungry, who dreams that he eats

<p class="indent-1"> he will shield her and deliver her, 

<p class="indent-2"> he will spare her and bring her to safety. 

<h4>The Enemy’s Downfall</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  O turn, you men of Israel, to Him 

<p class="indent-2"> whom deeply you have offended. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In that day each will disdain 

<p class="indent-2"> the gold and silver idols 

<p class="indent-2"> his guilty hands have made. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Assyria shall fall by no mortal sword; 

<p class="indent-2"> a sword, but not man’s, shall devour him. 

<p class="indent-1"> From the face of that sword he shall flee, 

<p class="indent-2"> and his youths shall be put to task-work. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  In his fear he will flee past his rocky retreat, 

<p class="indent-2"> and his princes shall run from the standard in panic. 

<p class="indent-1"> Thus says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  whose fire is in Zion, 

<p class="indent-2"> whose furnace is in Jerusalem. 

<h4>Rulers and People in the Coming Days</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 32]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Behold there cometh a King 

<p class="indent-2"> who shall rule in a spirit of justice, 

<p class="indent-2"> and princes who govern with equity – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Each like a shelter from the wind, 

<p class="indent-2"> a refuge from storm of rain, 

<p class="indent-1"> or like streamlets of water in dry parched places, 

<p class="indent-2"> or shade of great rock in a weary land. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the eyes that see shall not be sealed, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the ears that hear shall not be heedless; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The mind of the rash shall judge with discernment, 

<p class="indent-2"> the stammering tongue shall be fluent and plain. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  No more shall a fool be called ‟noble,” 

<p class="indent-2"> No more shall a knave be named ‟princely.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For the fool speaks folly for ever, 

<p class="indent-2"> his mind evermore plots mischief; 

<p class="indent-1"> his doings are profane, 

<p class="indent-2"> and error he speaks of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p class="indent-1"> He leaves the hungry unsated, 

<p class="indent-2"> and drink he withholds from the thirsty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The tricks of the evil are vile, 

<p class="indent-2"> and villainies he plans – 

<p class="indent-1"> To ruin the humble with lies, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the poor, though his plea may be just. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But the plans of the ‟noble” are noble, 

<p class="indent-2"> by nobleness shall he endure. 

<h4>Warning to the Women</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You women that are at ease, 

<p class="indent-2"> arise and hear my voice;

<p class="indent-2"> give ear to what I say. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In little more than a year 

<p class="indent-2"> you shall shudder, for all your confidence;

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Tremble, you women at ease, 

<p class="indent-2"> and you that are confident, shudder; 

<p class="indent-1"> strip you, and make you bare,

<p class="indent-1"> Not a house of mirth shall be left 

<p class="indent-2"> in all the jubilant city. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The palace shall be forsaken, 

<p class="indent-2"> the thronging city deserted; 

<p class="indent-1"> watchtower and hill shall become 

<p class="indent-2"> an everlasting waste. 

<h4>The Security and Prosperity of the Coming Days</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But yet from the heavenly height 

<p class="indent-2"> shall a spirit be poured upon us, 

<p class="indent-1"> and the desert become like a garden, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the garden be counted a forest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then justice shall dwell in the desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> and righteousness live in the garden-land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Of justice the fruit shall be peace, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the outcome of righteousness safety 

<p class="indent-2"> and quietness for ever. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  My people shall dwell in the mansion of peace, 

<p class="indent-2"> at the easeful rest in abodes secure. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The forest shall be felled, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the city laid utterly low. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Happy are you that may sow 

<p class="indent-2"> in a land that is all well watered, 

<p class="indent-2"> where oxen and asses may roam.

<h5>Historical Appendix</h5>

<h4>Isaiah Encourages Hezekiah to Resist Sennacheirb’s Summons to Surrender Jerusalem</h4>

<h5>First Narrative</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 36]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, after having assaulted and captured all the fortified cities of Judah,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  despatched his Chief Officer from Lachish with a large force against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. Near the conduit of the upper pool, where he had taken up his position on the Fuller’s Field Road,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  he was visited by a deputation consisting of Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The Chief Officer began: ‟This is the message from the Great King, the King of Assyria: I desire  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  you to deliver it to Hezekiah. ’What sort of confidence is this that you cherish? Do you imagine that in war a mere word of the lips is the equivalent of wisdom and strength? Now who is it you are  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  trusting in, that you presume to rebel against me? Of course you are trusting to Egypt, that staff of broken reed, which will enter and piece the hand of the man that leans upon it: that is all that Pharaoh King of Egypt will prove to those who  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  trust to him. If, however, you tell me you are trusting to your God the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , why, that is the very god whose sanctuaries and altars Hezekiah has abolished, commanding the people of Judah and Jerusalem to confine their worship to the altar at this  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  place? Now, make a wager, if you like, with my lord the King of Assyria: I am prepared to furnish you with two thousand horses, if you on your part  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  can supply them with riders. (But if you cannot), how do you propose to repel the onset of one of the least of my lord’s officers? yet you trust to Egypt  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for chariots and horsemen. And now do you imagine that I have not the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s sanction for invading this land with a view to its destruction? Why, it is the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  Himself who commissioned me to invade this land and destroy it.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Thereupon Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked the Chief Officer to be good enough not to speak to them in Hebrew, in the hearing of the people on the wall, but in Aramaic, which they assured him  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  they understood. ‟Nay,” replied the Officer, ‟it is not to your lord and yourself that my lord has sent me with this message, but precisely to the men on the wall, whom your policy is likely to reduce to eating their own filth and drinking their own water. ” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then the Chief Officer came forward and cried aloud in Hebrew, ‟Listen to the words of the  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Great King, the King of Assyria. Thus says the King: Do not let yourselves be imposed upon by  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Hezekiah, for he is powerless to deliver you; and do not let yourselves be induced to trust to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  by Hezekiah’s assurances that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will unquestionably save you, and that this city will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Give no heed to Hezekiah; for thus says the King of Assyria to you, Make your peace with me and surrender, and then everyone shall eat of his own vine and fig-tree, and drink water from his own  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  cistern, till I come and take you to a land like your own – a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you with assurances that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will save you. Has the god of any nation ever rescued his land from the grasp  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  of the King of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods Sepharvain? And where are the gods of the land of Samaria? Have they rescued Samaria from  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  his grasp? Which of all these national gods has succeeded in rescuing his land from my grasp, that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  should now rescue Jerusalem from my  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  grasp?” To this they answered not a word, they remained silent; for the King had expressly told  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  them not to answer him. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder, tore their garments, and returned to Hezekiah, telling him what the Chief Officer had said. 

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 37]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  into the Temple; and he despatched Eliakim, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, to whom they spoke as follows: ‟A message from Hezekiah! This is a day of trouble, chastisement, and disgrace: for children are come to the birth,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and there is not strength to bear them. But it may be that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God will hear the words of the Chief Officer, whom the King of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will punish the word which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God has heard: so lift up  <span class="v-num">[5,6]</span>  your prayer for those that remain.” And this was the answer that Isaiah returned to the deputation of King Hezekiah’s ministers: ‟Tell your master,” he said, ‟that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s message to him is this: he is not to be afraid of the blasphemous words he has heard from the minions of the King of Assyria.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  ’ Behold,’ says He, ’I will inspire him with such a spirit (of panic) that on the strength of a rumour he will return to this own land, and there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall a victim to the sword.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then the Chief Officer returned and found the King of Assyria engaged in the siege of Libnah, for he had heard that he had moved his camp from Lachish.  <span class="v-num">[9a]</span>  When the news reached him that Tirhakah King of Ethiopia was advancing to give him battle … 

<p> So Sennacherib, King of Assyria, broke up camp and returned to Nineveh, where he settled. Subsequently, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch his god, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer. They, however, made good their escape to Armenia, and he was succeeded by Esar-haddon his son. 

<h5>Second Narrative</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9b]</span>  Then he sent messengers to Hezekiah with the  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  following instructions. ‟This,” said he, ‟is what you are to say to Hezekiah King of Judah,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Do not let the god you trust in delude you with his assurance that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. You are well aware of the ruin the King of Assyria has brought upon all lands, and are  <i> you </i>  to escape?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Were the nations which my father destroyed saved by their gods – Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Edenites in Telassar? Where is the King of Hamath and the King of Arpad and the King of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Hezekiah received the letter at the hands of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Temple and spread it before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and to  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  thus he prayed: ‟O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts, You God is Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, You are God alone over all the kingdoms of the earth: You are the Creator of heaven and earth.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Incline Thine ear, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and hear; open Thine eyes, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and see; and hear the message of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  the living God. True it is, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , that the Kings of Assyria have devoted all nations and  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  their lands to destruction, and thrust their gods in the fire, for no gods were they at all, but wood and stone, fashioned by human hands and so they were  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  destroyed. But now, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , are God.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent this answer back to Hezekiah: ‟Thus says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib, King of Assyria.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  This is the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  concerning him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> The virgin, the daughter of Zion, 

<p class="indent-2"> contemns you and mocks you; 

<p class="indent-1"> behind you Jerusalem’s daughter 

<p class="indent-2"> is shaking her head. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Against whom have you lifted your voice 

<p class="indent-2"> in reviling and blasphemy? 

<p class="indent-1"> Yea, your eyes you have lifted to heaven 

<p class="indent-2"> against Israel’s Holy One. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  You have reviled, by your minions, 

<p class="indent-2"> the Lord, and have said, 

<p class="indent-1"> ‟With my chariots I climb the high hills, 

<p class="indent-2"> the recesses of Lebanon; 

<p class="indent-1"> her towering cedars I fell, 

<p class="indent-2"> and her cypresses choice; 

<p class="indent-1"> and I pierce to her furthest retreat, 

<p class="indent-2"> where the forest is thickest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Wells, too, (in the desert) I dig, 

<p class="indent-2"> and I drink of strange waters; 

<p class="indent-1"> with the sole of my foot I dry up 

<p class="indent-2"> all the Nile-streams of Egypt.” 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Hast you not heard that all this 

<p class="indent-2"> I prepared long ago? 

<p class="indent-1"> From the old I had planned it, and now 

<p class="indent-2"> I have brought it to pass: 

<p class="indent-1"> So ’tis your to lay fortified cities 

<p class="indent-2"> in desolate heaps. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Their inhabitants, impotent all, 

<p class="indent-2"> are dismayed and confounded, 

<p class="indent-1"> become like the grass of the field, 

<p class="indent-2"> like the green tender grass; 

<p class="indent-1"> they are like unto grass on the roofs 

<p class="indent-2"> that the east wind has blasted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Your sitting and rising I know, 

<p class="indent-2"> and your going and coming; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Your raging and uproar against Me 

<p class="indent-2"> are come to Mine ears. 

<p class="indent-1"> So My ring I will put through your nose 

<p class="indent-2"> and My bit in your lips, 

<p class="indent-1"> and (thus led) I will make you return 

<p class="indent-2"> by the way that you came. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And the sign unto you shall be this: 

<p class="indent-1"> This year you shall eat that which grows of itself, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the next that which springs therefrom; 

<p class="indent-1"> but the third you shall sow and reap, 

<p class="indent-2"> plant vineyards and eat of their fruit. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  And those that escape of the household of Judah 

<p class="indent-2"> shall again take root downward, and upward bear fruit; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, 

<p class="indent-2"> and forth from Mount Zion all such as escape. 

<p class="indent-1"> The zeal of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of Hosts 

<p class="indent-2"> shall bring this thing to pass. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Therefore thus says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  concerning the King of Assyria, 

<p class="indent-1"> he shall not come into this city, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor shoot an arrow there; 

<p class="indent-1"> he shall not come before it with shield, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor cast up a mound against it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But back he shall go by the way that he came, 

<p class="indent-2"> and into this city he shall not enter; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  For I will protect and deliver this city, 

<p class="indent-2"> for Mine own sake and David My servant’s sake. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then the angel of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  went forth and slew in the camp of Assyria one hundred and eighty-five thousand men: when they rose in the morning, behold! every man was a lifeless corpse. 

<h4>Hezekiah’s Sickness, Recovery, and Song of Thanksgiving</h4>

<h5>Hezekiah’s Sickness</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 38]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In those days Hezekiah was seized with a mortal sickness: and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said, ‟the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  commands you to set your household affairs in order; for you will  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  not recover, you are to die.” Then, turning his face to the wall, Hezekiah offered this prayer to  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> : ‟Remember, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , I beseech You, how I have lived in Your presence with a faithful and undivided heart, and done the thing that pleased You.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Then  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  there came to Isaiah this message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ‟Go and say to Hezekiah: This says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of David your father, ’I will add to your life fifteen  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  years more. You and this city together I will rescue from the grasp of the King of Assyria, and  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  this city I will protect.’” Then Isaiah said, ‟Let them take a cake of figs and press it on the boil, to  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  ensure his recovery.” And Hezekiah said, ‟What is the sign that I shall yet go up to the Temple?”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  ‟Take this,” he replied, ‟as a sign from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  that He will do what He has promised. Watch the shadow that the descending sun has cast on the step-clock of Ahaz: I will bring that shadow ten steps backward.” and the sun did indeed go back on the step-clock the ten steps it had gone down. 

<h5>Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  A psalm of Hezekiah King of Judah, to celebrate his recovery from the sickness which had overtaken him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Me thought I was doomed to depart 

<p class="indent-2"> when my life was at noon-tide – 

<p class="indent-1"> Consigned to the portals of Sheol 

<p class="indent-2"> the rest of my years. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I had thought to see Jah nevermore 

<p class="indent-2"> in the land of the living, 

<p class="indent-1"> and never again to behold 

<p class="indent-2"> any man in this world. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Like the tent of a shepherd, my home 

<p class="indent-2"> is plucked up and stripped from me; 

<p class="indent-1"> he has rolled up my life like a web, 

<p class="indent-2"> from the thrum He has cut me. 

<p class="indent-1"> To pain I am doomed night and day, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And I cry till the morning, 

<p class="indent-1"> while all my bones, like a lion 

<p class="indent-2"> he crushes in pieces. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I scream as screams a swift, 

<p class="indent-2"> like a dove do I moan; 

<p class="indent-1"> mine eyes look tearfully heavenward: 

<p class="indent-2"> O think on me, Lord, be my surety. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What can I utter or say, 

<p class="indent-2"> since ’tis He has done it. 

<p class="indent-1"> I toss all the time of my slumber – 

<p class="indent-2"> my soul is so bitter. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  O rest You my spirit, refresh me, 

<p class="indent-2"> and let me recover. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  "Tis You that have kept my soul 

<p class="indent-2"> from the pit of destruction. 

<p class="indent-1"> Behind Your back You have cast 

<p class="indent-2"> mine iniquities all. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For Sheol can give You no thanks, 

<p class="indent-2"> nor can Death sing Your praises; 

<p class="indent-1"> and they that go down to the pit 

<p class="indent-2"> cannot hope for Your love. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  It is the living, the living, that praise You, 

<p class="indent-2"> as I do this day. 

<p class="indent-1"> So the father shall tell to his sons 

<p class="indent-2"> of Your faithfulness sure. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Be pleased, O the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , to save us: 

<p class="indent-2"> Then all the days of our life 

<p class="indent-1"> we shall play upon instruments stringed 

<p class="indent-2"> in front of the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<h4>Hezekiah’s Vanity and Isaiah’s Rebuke</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Isaiah 39]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At that time, Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, King of Babylon, having heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered, despatched  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  eunuchs to him with a present. Hezekiah, delighted, proceeded to display to them his treasure- house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, the armoury, and the whole range of his treasures: there was nothing in his place or indeed in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then came the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah and said, ‟Where do these men come from, and what have they said?” ‟They have come,” said Hezekiah, ‟from a distant land, from Babylon.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  ‟What have they seen in your palace?” said Isaiah; and Hezekiah answered, ‟Everything: there is none of my treasures that I have not shown them.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ‟Listen, then,” said Isaiah, ‟to the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  of Hosts. Mark, the day is coming, when all that is in your palace, and all the treasures that you ancestors have hither to amassed, shall be carried to  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Babylon: nothing shall be left, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . And of the sons that may yet be born to you, some shall be taken to become eunuchs is the palace of the  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  King of Babylon.” Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, ‟I accept the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  which you have spoken.” At least, thought he, there will be peace and stability in my day.

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  No one sues the integrity,

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The ways of peace they know not,

<h1>The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah</h1>

<h5>Jeremiah’s Call and Early Visions</h5>

<h4>The Call</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 1]</p>

<p> v 1 The messages of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, a  member of the priestly order resident in Anathoth in  the district of Benjamin. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  A message came to him from Jehovah in the  thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  king of Judah; and (such messages) continued to  come to him in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of  Josiah, king of Judah, and up to the end of the  eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of  Judah, when in the fifth month the people of  Jerusalem were swept into exile. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  This is the message that came to me from Jehovah: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  "My thoughts were upon thee before I created thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And before thou wast born I had set thee apart, 

<p class="indent-2"> And appointed thee unto the nations a prophet." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And thus I made answer: 

<p class="indent-2"> "Alas! O Lord Jehovah, Behold! 

<p class="indent-2"> I have no skill of speech, I am only a child." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Jehovah made answer to me: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> "Do not plead thou art still but a child, 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou must go wheresoever I send thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And say whatsoever I bid thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Be not afraid at the sight of them, 

<p class="indent-1"> 2 For I will be with thee to save thee." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Thus spoke Jehovah; then with His outstretched hand 

<p class="indent-1"> He touched my mouth and said to me: 

<p class="indent-2"> "Herewith do I put My words in thy mouth, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Behold this day do I give thee authority 

<p class="indent-1"> Over the nations and over the kingdoms, 

<p class="indent-2"> To uproot and demolish, destroy and tear down, 

<p class="indent-2"> To upbuild and to plant." 

<h4>The Reassuring Vision of the Almond Tree</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This further message came to me from Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-2"> "What seest thou there, Jeremiah?" (said the Voice). 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  "A branch of an almond tree," I answered. "Thou 

<p class="indent-1"> hast seen truly," said Jehovah," for I am watching? 

<p class="indent-1"> over My purpose, to perform it." 

<h4>The Vision of the Caldron of War</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then there came to me a second message from  Jehovah. "What seest thou now?" (said the  Voice). "A boiling pot," I answered, "facing the 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  north." Then Jehovah said to me: 

<p class="indent-1"> From the north shall disaster break forth 

<p class="indent-2"> Over all that inhabit the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For I, saith Jehovah, do summon 

<p class="indent-2"> The northern kingdoms all; 

<p class="indent-1"> Each king shall come and set hi throne 

<p class="indent-2"> At the gates that lead into Jerusalem, 

<p class="indent-1"> And against her encircling walls, 

<p class="indent-2"> And against all the cities of Judah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I will utter My judgments against them 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of their wickedness; 

<p class="indent-1"> For Me they have forsaken, 

<p class="indent-2"> And to to other gods offered sacrifice, 

<p class="indent-2"> And bowed to the work of their hands. 

<h4>The Divine Summons and the Divine Assurance</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[As]</span>  for thee, gird up thy loins, 

<p class="indent-2"> Arise and declare unto them 

<p class="indent-2"> Whatsoever I command thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> Let the sight of them not dismay thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Else I will dismay thee before them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As for Me, behold! This day 

<p class="indent-2"> As a fortified city I make thee, 

<p class="indent-1"> A pillar of iron, a wall of bronze, 

<p class="indent-2"> Against the whole of the land– 

<p class="indent-1"> The kings and the courtiers of Judah, 

<p class="indent-2"> The priests and the folk of the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[They]</span>  will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor: 

<p class="indent-2"> For I – saith Jehovah most solemnly– 

<p class="indent-2"> I will be with thee to save thee. 

<h5>The Earlier Messages of Jeremiah</h5>

<h4>Israel’s Ancient Fidelity and Happiness</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  There came to me this message from Jehovah: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: 

<p class="indent-1"> Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> I remember the love of thy youth– 

<p class="indent-2"> An affectionate bride wast thou– 

<p class="indent-1"> When thou followedst Me in the desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> A land that was all unsown; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Israel belonged to Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> His first-fruits, sacred to Him. 

<p class="indent-1"> Whosoever devoured her was punished, 

<p class="indent-2"> On such did disaster fall. 

<h4>Israel’s Long Record of Infidelity with its Bitter Consequences</h4>

<h5>Her Ingratitude and Unparalleled Apostasy</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Hear the word of Jehovah, O household of Jacob, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all ye families of the household of Israel: 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> What wrong did your fathers discover in Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> That they went from Me afar, 

<p class="indent-1"> To follow after vanities, 

<p class="indent-2"> Till they, too, becane a vanity, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And never sought afer Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who brought them up out of Egypt, 

<p class="indent-1"> And led them through the desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> A land of steppes and pits, 

<p class="indent-1"> A land of drought and gloom, 

<p class="indent-2"> A land that no man traversed, 

<p class="indent-2"> A lanf where no man dwelt? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And I brought you into a garden-land, 

<p class="indent-2"> To enjoy its fruits and its good things: 

<p class="indent-1"> But ye came and defiled My land 

<p class="indent-2"> And made Mine inheritance loathsome, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  No priest was heard any more 

<p class="indent-2"> Enquiring afer Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> They that handle the law did not know Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> The rulers rebelled against Me. 

<p class="indent-1"> The prophets spoke by Baal, 

<p class="indent-2"> And followed useless idols. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I must therefore contend with you still, 

<p class="indent-2"> And with your children’s children. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Pass across to the isles of Cyprus, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or send afar unto Kedar; 

<p class="indent-1"> Note carefully, and see, 

<p class="indent-2"> Hath there ever been aught like this? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Hath ever a nation exchanged its gods, 

<p class="indent-2"> Though they be no gods at all? 

<p class="indent-1"> But My people hath exchanged 

<p class="indent-2"> Their Glory for useless idols. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Be appaled at this, ye heavens, 

<p class="indent-2"> And shudder exceedingly. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For My people, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Have done two evil things: 

<p class="indent-1"> Me they have forsaken, 

<p class="indent-2"> The Fountain of Living Water, 

<p class="indent-1"> To hew for themselves leaking cisterns, 

<p class="indent-2"> That can hold no water at all. 

<h5>The Consequences of Israel’s Apostasy</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Is Israel a servant? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or is he a home-born slave? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why then hath he fallen a prey? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And why are his cities wasted? 

<p class="indent-1"> Young lions have roared against him, 

<p class="indent-2"> And lifted up their voice; 

<p class="indent-1"> They have made his land all desolate, 

<p class="indent-2"> And no man dwelleth therein. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yea, the people of Memphis and Daphnae 

<p class="indent-2"> Have shorn the crown of thy head; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And is this not come upon thee 

<p class="indent-2"> Through forsaking Jehovah thy God? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now why dost thou wander to Egypt 

<p class="indent-2"> And drink the waters of Nile? 

<p class="indent-1"> And why dost thou go to Assyria, 

<p class="indent-2"> To drink of the streams of Euphrates? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Thy defection shall bring thee pain, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy wickedness sore reproof; 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou shalt know and see for thyself 

<p class="indent-2"> What a bitte thing it is 

<p class="indent-2"> To forsake Jehovah thy God, 

<p class="indent-1"> And to cherish no awe of Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts. 

<h5>Israel’s Devotion to Idolatry</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For of old thou didst break thy yoke, 

<p class="indent-2"> And burst thy bonds in sunder; 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou saidst, "I refuse to serve:" 

<p class="indent-2"> But high upon every hill 

<p class="indent-1"> And under every green tree 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou didst stretch thee, playing the harlot. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Yet I as a choice vine had planted thee– 

<p class="indent-2"> Sound was thy stock altogether; 

<p class="indent-1"> But now art thou turned to be bitter, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou wild degenerate vine! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For though thou shouldst wash thee with soda, 

<p class="indent-2"> And take thee abundance of soap, 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet the Lord, as He seeth thy guilt, 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall declare it of deepest dye. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  How canst thou say, "All stainless am I, 

<p class="indent-2"> I have not gone after the Baals"? 

<p class="indent-1"> Look at thy way in the Valley, 

<p class="indent-2"> And know what thou hast done. 

<p class="indent-1"> A swift young camel art thou, 

<p class="indent-2"> That courseth hither and thither, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  A heifer run wild in the desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> Aglow with the heat of ther passion; 

<p class="indent-1"> That snifeth the wind in her longing, 

<p class="indent-2"> And who can turn her back? 

<p class="indent-1"> No one need wearily seek her– 

<p class="indent-2"> In her month she is sure to be found. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Run not the shoes off thy feet, 

<p class="indent-2"> And spare thy throat, lest it parch. 

<p class="indent-1"> But thou saidst,"There is no hope – none: 

<p class="indent-2"> For I am inlove with strangers, 

<p class="indent-2"> And after them will I go." 

<h5>The Impotence of the Gods solicited by Israel</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But Israel’s house shall be shamed 

<p class="indent-2"> As a thief that is caught is ashamed– 

<p class="indent-1"> They and their kings and their princes, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their priests and their prophets together; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  That say to a stock, "My father," 

<p class="indent-2"> To a stone, "It is thou that hast borne me." 

<p class="indent-1"> For unto Me they turned 

<p class="indent-2"> Their backs and not their faces; 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet in time of trouble they say, 

<p class="indent-2"> "O rise Thou up and save us." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But where are the gods thou didst make thee? 

<p class="indent-2"> Let them arise, if they 

<p class="indent-2"> Can save thee in time of trouble; 

<p class="indent-1"> For as many as are thy cities, 

<p class="indent-2"> So many thy gods, O Judah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Why do ye wrangle with Me? 

<p class="indent-2"> For wicked ye are, every man of you; 

<p class="indent-1"> Rebels are ye, saith Jehovah– 

<p class="indent-2"> Rebels against Me, each man of you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  In vain have I smitten your children, 

<p class="indent-2"> They would not receive correction; 

<p class="indent-1"> The sword hath devoured your prophets, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a lion that dealeth destruction, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  And yet ye are unafraid. 

<p class="indent-2"> So hear ye the word of Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Have I been a desert to Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> A dark and gloomy land? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why then do ye say, "We are free, 

<p class="indent-2"> We will come unto Thee nevermore?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Can a maid forget her ornaments, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or a bride forget her sash? 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet Me hath My people forgotten 

<p class="indent-2"> Days and days without number. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  In quest of love how bravely 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou trippest along thy way! 

<p class="indent-1"> Small wonder thy deeds are so vile, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy way hath been all polluted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Yea, blood was found in thy skirts– 

<p class="indent-2"> Of the lives of the innocent poor– 

<p class="indent-1"> As though thou hadst caught them at theft! 

<p class="indent-2"> For all this (I would therefore contend with thee); 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Yet thou hast said: "I am innocent, 

<p class="indent-2"> Surely His anger is over." 

<p class="indent-1"> But see, I will enter with thee into judgment, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because thou dost claim to be sinless. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Why runnest thou hither and thither 

<p class="indent-2"> Witg so frivolous a heart? 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou shalt yet reap shame from Egypt, 

<p class="indent-2"> As thou has reaped shame from Assyria. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Yea, thence shalt thou also go forth, 

<p class="indent-2"> With thy hands upon thy head; 

<p class="indent-2"> For those whom thou trustest Jehovah hath spurned, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thou shalt not make good thine escape. 

<h5>Judah the Faithless</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 3]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  If a man divorceth his wife, 

<p class="indent-2"> And she goeth away from him 

<p class="indent-1"> And becometh the wife of another, 

<p class="indent-2"> Can she ever again be his? 

<p class="indent-1"> Is such a woman as she 

<p class="indent-2"> Not altogether polluted? 

<p class="indent-1"> Bit thou hast played the harlot 

<p class="indent-2"> With many and many a lover; 

<p class="indent-1"> And canst thou dare to dream 

<p class="indent-2"> Of returning to Me, saith Jehovah? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Lift up thine eyes to the heights, and behold, 

<p class="indent-2"> Where hast thou not been ravished? 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou hast waited for them by the ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a Bedouin in the desert; 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou hast stained the land by thy whoredoms, 

<p class="indent-2"> And by thy wicked ways, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And through thy many lovers 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou hast let thysef be snared. 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou hast a harlot’s forhead, 

<p class="indent-2"> Refusing to be abashed, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Yet but now has been calling Me Father 

<p class="indent-2"> And Comrade of thy youth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  "Can He keep His anger for ever, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or cherished it to the end? 

<p class="indent-1"> Yes, such were thy words; but they deeds 

<p class="indent-2"> To the last degree were vile. 

<h4>Judah’s Infidelity more Awful than Israel’s</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In the days of the King Josiah Jehovah said to me:  "Hast thou seem what back-sliding Israel did? She  went up on every high mountain and under every  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  green tree and ther she played the harlot. I had  hoped that, after all this, she would return to Me. But  no! she did not return. Her faithless sister Judah  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  saw that I had put back-sliding Israel away because of  her adultery, and that I had given her a bill of divorce;  nevertheless faithless Judah was not at all afraid, but  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  she too went and played the harlot, defiling the land  by her wanton whoredom, and committing adultery  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  with stones and stocks. Nevertheless, when faithless  Judah turned to Me, it was not with her whole heart,  but only in pretence." 

<h4>Offer of Pardon and Promise of Glory</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then Jehovah said to me, "Backsliding Israel has  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  justified herself more than faithless Judah. Go and  proclaim these words towards the north and say:  O backsliding Israel, turn, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> I will not look in anger upon thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> For I am kind, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> I keep not Mine anger for ever. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But only acknowledge thy guilt– 

<p class="indent-2"> That, disloyal to Jehovah thy God, 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou hast lavished thy love upon strangers 

<p class="indent-2"> Beneath every spreading tree, 

<p class="indent-1"> And unto My voice, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou hast not inclined thine ear. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Return, ye backsliding children, saith Jehovah,  for I am your husband and lord; and I will take  one of you from each city and two from each clan,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and I will brring you to Zion, and give you rulers after  My own mind, who shall tend you with wisdom and  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  skill. And when in those days you have grown  numerous and fruitful in the land, saith Jehovah, men  shall speak no more of the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah; it shall never enter their minds, they will  neither think of it nor miss it, nor will they ever again  make another. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  At that time Jerusalem shall be called the Throne  of Jehovah, and all the nations shall gather thereto;  they shall follow no more the stubbornness of their  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  evil hearts. In those days the household of Judah  shall join the household of Israel, and together they  shall come from the north land to the land that I gave  your forefathers for an inheritance. 

<h4>A Penitent Return will be met by the Divine Acceptance</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  How glad, methought, shall I be 

<p class="indent-2"> To give thee a place among sons, 

<p class="indent-1"> To give thee a pleasant land, 

<p class="indent-2"> An inheritance passing fair! 

<p class="indent-1"> Me thought ye would call Me Father, 

<p class="indent-2"> And follow Me evermore; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But ye have been false unto Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> As a woman is false to her lover. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Hark! weeping is heard on the heights– 

<p class="indent-2"> It is suppliant Israel crying, 

<p class="indent-1"> Because they have walked perversely, 

<p class="indent-2"> Forgetting Jehovah their God. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  "Return, ye backsliding I will heal." 

<p class="indent-1"> "Behold, we are come unto Thee,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The hills are but a dellusion, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the orgies upon the mountains; 

<p class="indent-1"> In Jehovah our God alone 

<p class="indent-2"> Is Israel’s salvation. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The Baal hath devoured the toil

<p class="indent-1"> Their sheep and their oxen together, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their sons and their daughters together 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  We would lay us down in our shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> All covered with confusion; 

<p class="indent-1"> For before our God we have sinned, 

<p class="indent-2"> We and our fathers from youth 

<p class="indent-2"> Even unto this very day; 

<p class="indent-1"> And we have not hearkened at all 

<p class="indent-1"> To the voice of Jehovah our God." 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 4]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  "O Israel, if thou wilt return," saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> If thou but return unto Me,

<p class="indent-2"> If thou raom not hither and thither; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If sincerely and justly and truly 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou swear, ’As Jehovah liveth,’ 

<p class="indent-1"> Then nations shall pray for a blessing like thine, 

<p class="indent-2"> And in thee shall they make their boast. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah to the citizens of Judah, 

<p class="indent-2"> And to them that dwell in Jerusalem: 

<p class="indent-1"> Break up the ground that lies fallow, 

<p class="indent-2"> And sow ye not among thorns; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Circumcise ye your own selves to Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Remove from your hearts the foreskin,

<p class="indent-1"> Lest My fury go forth like fire 

<p class="indent-2"> And blaze beyond all quenching, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of your evil doings." 

<h4>The Impending Judgment to be Executed by a Foreign Invader</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Declare ye this message in Judah, 

<p class="indent-2"> And publish it in Jerusalem; 

<p class="indent-1"> Blow the trumpet throughout the land,

<p class="indent-1"> "Gather and let us betake ourselves 

<p class="indent-2"> Into the fortified cities." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Lift towards Zion a signal, 

<p class="indent-2"> Flee ye for safety and stay out; 

<p class="indent-1"> For disaster and fell destruction 

<p class="indent-2"> I soon will bring out the north. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A lion hath gone from his thicket; 

<p class="indent-2"> The Devastator of nations 

<p class="indent-1"> Hath left and gone forth from his place 

<p class="indent-2"> To desolate the earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Gird yourselves therefore with sackcloth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Make ye lament and wail; 

<p class="indent-2"> For the fierce glowing wrath of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> Doth turn not away nor leave us. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The heart of the king and the princes 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall fail int that day, saith Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> The priests shall be seized with horror, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the prophets with amazement. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They shall say "Ah, Lord Jehovah! 

<p class="indent-1"> Ah! Surely Thou hast deluded 

<p class="indent-2"> This people and Jerusalem, 

<p class="indent-1"> Assuring us all would be well, 

<p class="indent-2"> While the doth pierce to the soul." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This message shall then be declared 

<p class="indent-2"> To Jerusalem and this people: 

<p class="indent-1"> A glowing wind from the desert

<p class="indent-1"> But not tp winnow or cleanse– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Too keen is the blast for that. 

<p class="indent-2"> So now I will utter My judgment upon them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Behold! he mounteth as clouds, 

<p class="indent-2"> His chariots are like to the whirlwind, 

<p class="indent-1"> His horses are swifter than eagles: 

<p class="indent-2"> "Woe unto us! we are spoiled." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Wash thy heart of wickedness, 

<p class="indent-2"> Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: 

<p class="indent-1"> How long wilt thou harbour within thee 

<p class="indent-2"> Thine evil imaginations? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Hark! a message from Dan, 

<p class="indent-2"> From Mount Ephraim, evil tidings; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Procalaim it among the nations, 

<p class="indent-2"> And publish it over Jerusalem. 

<p class="indent-1"> Behold! leopards are coming 

<p class="indent-2"> From a land that is far away, 

<p class="indent-1"> They are raising loud their roar 

<p class="indent-2"> Against the cities of Judah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Lying in wait in the fields, 

<p class="indent-2"> They beset her round and round– 

<p class="indent-1"> "Because," declareth Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> "She hath rebelled against Me." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Thy doings and thy behaviour 

<p class="indent-2"> Have brought these things upon thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> This is the fruit of thy wickedness– 

<p class="indent-2"> Bitter indeed it is, 

<p class="indent-2"> It pierceth thy very heart. 

<h4>The Prophet’s Anguish</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O the pain, the pain in my bosom, 

<p class="indent-2"> The walls of my heart are athrob: 

<p class="indent-1"> My heart is a tumuly within me, 

<p class="indent-2"> I cannot hold my peace; 

<p class="indent-1"> For the sound of the trumpet I hear, 

<p class="indent-2"> The din and alarum of battle. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Ruin doth break upon ruin, 

<p class="indent-2"> For all the land is laid waste; 

<p class="indent-1"> My tents of a sudden are spoiled, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea, all in a moment my curtains. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  How long must I look on the standard 

<p class="indent-2"> And hear the sound of the trumpet? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For foolish is my people, 

<p class="indent-2"> And me they do not know; 

<p class="indent-1"> Sottish children they are, 

<p class="indent-2"> Devoid of understanding: 

<p class="indent-1"> Wise are they to do evil, 

<p class="indent-2"> But they know not how to do good. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  I looked at the earth, and behold! it was empty. 

<p class="indent-2"> I looked at the heavens, and their light was gone, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  I looked at the mountains, and lo! they were trembling, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all the hills moved to and fro. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  I looked and looked, but behold, there was no man, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all the birds of the heaven had fled. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  I looked at the fruit-land: behold! it was desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all the cities were fallen in ruins, 

<p class="indent-2"> Laid waste by the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah. 

<h4>The Irrevocable Doom</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For thus Jehovah hath said, 

<p class="indent-2"> The land shall be all desolation. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  For this the earth shall mourn, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the heavens above be black; 

<p class="indent-1"> For I have not repented My words, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I will not turn back from My purpose. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen 

<p class="indent-2"> The whole land taketh to flight; 

<p class="indent-1"> They enter the thickets and caves, 

<p class="indent-2"> They climb up on to the rocks. 

<p class="indent-1"> Abandoned is very city, 

<p class="indent-2"> And not a man dwelleth therein. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Why, then, dost thou robe thee in scarlet, 

<p class="indent-2"> And deck thee with jewels of gold, 

<p class="indent-1"> And paintest thine eyes to enlarge them? 

<p class="indent-2"> In vain dost thou make thyself fair. 

<p class="indent-1"> They that doted on thee despite thee; 

<p class="indent-2"> It is thy life that they seek. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  For a cry have I heard as of woman in travail, 

<p class="indent-2"> A scream as of one bringing forth her first child. 

<p class="indent-1"> Hark! ’tis the daughter of Zion 

<p class="indent-2"> That gaspeth and spreadeth her hands, 

<p class="indent-1"> Saying, "Ah! woe is me! I am faint, 

<p class="indent-2"> I am sinking – the victim of muderers." 

<h4>The Universal Corruption of the Nation</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 5]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Run to tand fro through the streets of Jerusalem, 

<p class="indent-2"> Look ye around and examine; 

<p class="indent-1"> Search in her open spaces 

<p class="indent-2"> If ye can find a man– 

<p class="indent-1"> Any that acteth justly, 

<p class="indent-2"> And seeketh after truth; 

<p class="indent-1"> Then I – Jehovah declareth– 

<p class="indent-2"> Will grant her My forgiveness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But even when they say, "By Jehovah," 

<p class="indent-2"> They are ready to swear to a lie. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Dost Thou look then, Jehovah, on falsehood, 

<p class="indent-2"> And not upon the truth? 

<p class="indent-1"> To all Thy blows they were callous, 

<p class="indent-2"> They refused to accept correction; 

<p class="indent-1"> Their faces were harder than stone, 

<p class="indent-2"> They refused to turn (and repent). 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  "But these," thought I, "are the poor, 

<p class="indent-2"> The people without understanding, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who know not the way of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> The ordinance of their God. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I will get me unto the great men, 

<p class="indent-2"> And unto them will I speak; 

<p class="indent-1"> For they know the way of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> The ordinance of their God." 

<p class="indent-1"> But these very men have all broken the yoke, 

<p class="indent-2"> And snapped the bonds asunder. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Soon therefore shall they be slain 

<p class="indent-2"> By a lion out of the forest; 

<p class="indent-2"> A wolf from the steppes shal despoil them. 

<p class="indent-1"> A leopard shall lurk by their cities, 

<p class="indent-2"> And rend all that issue therefrom. 

<p class="indent-1"> For many are their their transgressions, 

<p class="indent-2"> And far they have turned away. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  How then for this can I pardon thee? 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy children have forsaken Me, 

<p class="indent-1"> Swearing by gods that are no gods; 

<p class="indent-2"> And, when to the full I had fed them, 

<p class="indent-1"> Adultery they committed, 

<p class="indent-2"> They lodge in the houses of harlots. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Well fed stallions were they, 

<p class="indent-2"> Neighing each for his neighbour’s wife. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And crimes like these, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Am I to leave unpunished? 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall not My soul be avenged

<h4>The Implacable Doom</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Like an open grave is their quiver,

<p class="indent-2"> They shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees, 

<p class="indent-1"> They shall beat down the fortified cities, 

<p class="indent-2"> Wherein thou didst trust, with the sword. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But in those days, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will not make a clean end of you. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And in time to come, when ye say to Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Why hath Jehovah our God 

<p class="indent-1"> Done all these things unto us?" 

<p class="indent-2"> Then shalt thou say unto them, 

<p class="indent-1"> "As ye have forsaken Me,

<p class="indent-2"> She keepeth her wickedness fresh; 

<p class="indent-1"> Within her are rapine and violence heard, 

<p class="indent-2"> Sickness and wounds are for ever before Me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  O Jerusalem, be admonished, 

<p class="indent-2"> Lest My soul from thee be severed, 

<p class="indent-1"> Lest I make thee a desolation, 

<p class="indent-2"> An unihabited land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts; 

<p class="indent-1"> "Glean like a vine full thoroughly 

<p class="indent-2"> Those that are left of Israel; 

<p class="indent-1"> Set thy hand once more 

<p class="indent-2"> As a vintager unto the branches." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  "But to whom shall I speak and bear witness 

<p class="indent-2"> In such wise that they listen? 

<p class="indent-1"> For see! their ear is uncircumcised, 

<p class="indent-2"> Helpless are they to hearken. 

<p class="indent-1"> To them is the word of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> Become an utter scorn; 

<p class="indent-2"> They have no pleasure in it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I am filled with the wrath of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> I am weary of holding it back: 

<p class="indent-1"> On the child in the street I will pour it, 

<p class="indent-2"> On youths, too, where’er they assemble; 

<p class="indent-1"> It shall smite men and women alike, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the aged, whose days are many. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Their homes shall be turned unto others, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their fields and their wives together; 

<p class="indent-1"> For against those that dwell in the land 

<p class="indent-2"> I will stretch out My hand, saith Jehovah." 

<h4>The National Materialism and its Doom</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For great and small alike, 

<p class="indent-2"> They are all of them greedy of gain; 

<p class="indent-1"> Prophet and priest alike– 

<p class="indent-2"> Every man of them practiseth falsehood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They would heal the hurt of My people, 

<p class="indent-2"> As though it were but slight; 

<p class="indent-2"> "It is well, it is well," they say, 

<p class="indent-2"> "When it is anything but well." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Are they at all abashed 

<p class="indent-2"> At their deeds abominable? 

<p class="indent-1"> Nay, they are unabashed, 

<p class="indent-2"> They know not how to blush. 

<p class="indent-1"> They shall therefore fall with the fallen; 

<p class="indent-2"> In the hour of their visitation 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall stumble, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thus did Jehovah say: 

<p class="indent-1"> Stand in the ways and see, 

<p class="indent-2"> And ask for the ancient paths; 

<p class="indent-1"> Mark that which leadeth to happiness, 

<p class="indent-2"> See that ye walk therein– 

<p class="indent-1"> And ye shall find rest to your souls. 

<p class="indent-2"> But they said, " We refuse to walk in it." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And over you I set watchmen. 

<p class="indent-2"> Saying "Hark for the sound of the trumpet." 

<p class="indent-2"> But they said, "We refuse to hearken." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Wherefore hearken, ye nations, and hear, O earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Take knowledge of that which is coming. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Behold, I will bring on this people 

<p class="indent-2"> Disaster, the fruits of their backsliding; 

<p class="indent-1"> For they heeded not My words, 

<p class="indent-2"> My instruction they rejected. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Of what avail to Me 

<p class="indent-2"> Is the incense that cometh from Sheba, 

<p class="indent-2"> And sweet cane from a distant land? 

<p class="indent-1"> I accept not yout burnt-offerings, 

<p class="indent-2"> Your sacrifice pleaseth Me not. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Therefore, thus saith Jehovah: Behold,

<p class="indent-1"> Stones over which they may stumble,

<p class="indent-1"> Fathers and sons together– 

<p class="indent-2"> And neighbour and friend shall perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah, Behold! 

<p class="indent-2"> A people doth come from the north land, 

<p class="indent-1"> A mighty nation is stirring 

<p class="indent-2"> At the uttermost ends of the earth 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Bow they wield and javelin– 

<p class="indent-2"> Cruel and pitiless they, 

<p class="indent-1"> With a voice like the roar of the sea, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they ride upon horses and chariots, 

<p class="indent-1"> Arrayed, like one man, for the battle,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The rumour thereof we have heard, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all unnerved are we:

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  O daughter of My people, 

<p class="indent-1"> Gird thee about with sackcloth

<h5>Messages from the Middle Period of Jeremiah’s Career</h5>

<h4>Salvation lies neither in Temple nor Ritual, but only in Repentance and Reform</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Take thy stand at the gate of the Temple, and there  make the following proclamation. Say, Listen to  this message from Jehovah, all ye men of Judah that  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  enter these gates to worship Jehovah. Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways  and your doings, and I will guarantee this place as your  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  permanent home. But put no trust in lying messen-  gers, who say: "This is the Temple of Jehovah, the  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah." For if  you really amend your ways and your doings: if  you really do justice as between man and man;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  if you abstain from the oppression of the resident  alien, the fatherless and the widow, from the shed-  ding of innocent blood in this place, and from devotion  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  to other gods to your own hurt, then I will guarantee  you a home here for all time in the land that I gave  your forefathers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But see, you are putting your trust in doctrines that  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  are as profitless as they are false. What! you commit  theft, murder, adultery, perjury, you burn sacrifice  to the Baal, you run after other gods that are  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  strange to you; and then you (have the hardihood  to) come and stand before me in this House which is  called by My name, and say, "Now we are safe" – in  order, forsooth, to carry on all these abominations.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This House which bears My name you regard, do you,  as nothing but a robbers’ cave? Make no mistake:  I – saith Jehovah – I have not been blind to all this. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I would ask you to visit My sanctuary in Shiloh,  where I put My name at the first, and see what the  wickedness of My people Israel constrained Me to do  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  to it. And so it will be now, saith Jehovah. Because  you have perpetrated all these anormities, in defiance  of My most earnest and repeated words, and have  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  refused to respond to My call, therefore this Temple  in which you repose your trust – called by My name  though it be – and the place that I gave to you and  your forefathers, I will consign to the same fate as  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  overtook Shiloh; and I will hurl you out of My sight  as I have hurled your brethren, the whole race of  Ephraim. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raise  no cry or prayer on their behalf, and make no inter-  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  cession to Me, for I will not listen to thee. Seest thou  not what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood,  the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough,  to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour  out drink-offerings to other gods, in order to vex Me.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Is it I, then, saith Jehovah, whom they are vexing?  is it not rather themselves, doomed as they are to  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  bring confusion upon their own faces/. Therefore,  thus saith the Lord Jehovah, "My anger and My  fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man  and beast, upon trees of the field and fruit of the ground,  and it shall blaze in unquenchable flame." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel,  Put the flesh of your burnt-offerings and your  (other) sacrifices together, and make a common meal  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  of them both alike; for on the day that I brought your  forefathers out of the land of Egypt, I gave them no  commandment nor did I utter a syllable with regard to  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  burnt offering or sacrifice. But the commandment I  gave them was this: Listen, I said, to My voice, and  then I will be your God and you shall be My people,  and take My commandments as the standard of all  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  your life – this is the way to prosperity. But, instead  of inclining their ear and listening, they followed the  dictates of their own stubborn and wicked hearts; they  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  went backwards instead of forwards. Ever since your  forefathers came out of the land of Egypt, every day up  to this very day I have been sending you early and late  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  all My servants the prophets. Instead, however,  of inclining their ear, they stiffened their necks and  behaved worse than their forefathers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  This, then, is the message thou art to address to  them, though they will not listen to thee, nor respond  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  to thy call – thy message is to be this: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> This is the folk that refused to listen 

<p class="indent-2"> To the voice of Jehovah their God– 

<p class="indent-2"> That refused to accept correction. 

<p class="indent-1"> Sincerity is vanished, 

<p class="indent-2"> It is found on their lips no more. 

<h4>The Fearful Judgment upon Idolatry</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Shear off thy locks – away with them– 

<p class="indent-2"> Lift up a dirge on the heights: 

<p class="indent-1"> For Jehovah hath spurned and forsaken 

<p class="indent-2"> The race that hath roused Him to anger. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The people of Judah, saith Jehovah, have done the  thing I abhor: the very House that bears My name  they have defiled by introducing into it their abomin-  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  able worship. They have built a sanctuary of Topheth  in the Valley of the son of Hinnom, for the burning of  their sons and daughters in the fire, though this was  no commandment of Mine – such a thing never entered  into My mind. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Mark this therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah,  when it shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valley  of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, and  Topheth shall be used as a burial-place for want of  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  room (elsewhere). The dead bodies of this people  shall be devoured by the birds of the air and the beasts  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  of the earth, and none shall scare them away. In the  cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem I will  still the voice of mirth and gladness, and the voice of  bridegroom and bride; for the land shall become a waste. 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At the time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out of  their graves the bones of the kings, the princes, the  priests, and the prophets, of Judah, and of the in-  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  habitants of Jerusalem, and they shall spread them  before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven,  whom they loved and served and followed and sought  and worshipped; and they shall remain ungathered  and unburried, they shall be for dung on the face of the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ground. And in all places to which I have driven them,  every man that is left of this evil family would choose  rather death than life, saith Jehovah of Hosts. 

<h4>The National Refusal to Repent and the Coming Retribution</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Doth not one who has fallen rise up again, 

<p class="indent-2"> And one who hath wandered turn back again? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Why, then, doth thy people keep turning 

<p class="indent-2"> For ever and ever backward, 

<p class="indent-1"> Clinging to ways deceitful, 

<p class="indent-2"> Refusing to return? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I have listened with ear intent– 

<p class="indent-2"> And their words are utterly false. 

<p class="indent-1"> Not a man repents of his wickedness 

<p class="indent-2"> Or thinks upon what he has done: 

<p class="indent-1"> But each rushes on in his course 

<p class="indent-2"> As a war-horse rushes in battle. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The very stork in the heavens 

<p class="indent-2"> Doth know her appointed seasons; 

<p class="indent-1"> The turtle, the swift, and the swallow, 

<p class="indent-2"> Observe the time of their coming: 

<p class="indent-1"> But the ordinance of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> My people doth not know. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  How can ye say, "We are wise, 

<p class="indent-2"> And with us is the law of Jehovah"? 

<p class="indent-1"> For see! the false pen of the sribes 

<p class="indent-2"> Hath turned it into a falsehood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So the wise shall be put to shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> Be dismayed and taken captive. 

<p class="indent-1"> They have spurned the word of Jehovah– 

<p class="indent-2"> What manner of wisdom have they? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So their wives I will give unto others, 

<p class="indent-2"> To conquerors their fields. 

<p class="indent-1"> For, great and small alike, 

<p class="indent-2"> They are all of them greedy of gain; 

<p class="indent-1"> Prophet and priest alike– 

<p class="indent-2"> Every man of them practiseth falsehood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They would heal the hurt of My people 

<p class="indent-2"> As though it were but slight; 

<p class="indent-2"> "It is well, it is well," they say, 

<p class="indent-2"> "When it is anything but well." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Are they at all abashed 

<p class="indent-2"> At their deeds abominable? 

<p class="indent-1"> Nay, they are unabashed, 

<p class="indent-2"> They know not how to blush. 

<p class="indent-1"> They shall therefore fall with the fallen; 

<p class="indent-2"> In the hour of their visitation 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall stumble, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When I, saith Jehovah, would gather their fruit, 

<p class="indent-2"> There is not a grape on the vine; 

<p class="indent-1"> There is not a fig on the fig-tree, 

<p class="indent-2"> All withered are the leaves. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  "Why are we sitting still? 

<p class="indent-2"> Assemble yourselves together, 

<p class="indent-1"> Let us enter the fortified cities, 

<p class="indent-2"> And there let us meet our doom; 

<p class="indent-1"> For Jehovah our God hath doomed us, 

<p class="indent-2"> Hath given us gall to drink, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because we have sinned against Him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  We wait for peace, but no good cometh; 

<p class="indent-2"> For a season of healing, but lo! dismay." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  From Dan is heard the snort of his steeds, 

<p class="indent-1"> At the sound of his stallions neighing 

<p class="indent-2"> All the land doth tremble. 

<p class="indent-1"> They come and devour the land 

<p class="indent-2"> And all that is therein, 

<p class="indent-2"> The city and her inhabitants. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For see! I will send amongst you 

<p class="indent-2"> serpents of basilik order, 

<p class="indent-1"> Which cannot be charmed at all; 

<p class="indent-2"> And they, saith Jehovah, shall bite you. 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Lament over the Sin and the Doom of his people</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Past healing is my sorrow, 

<p class="indent-2"> My heart is heavy within me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Hark! a voice is calling 

<p class="indent-2"> From the daughter of my people 

<p class="indent-2"> From a land that is far away: 

<p class="indent-1"> "Is not Jehovah in Zion? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is not her King therein?" 

<p class="indent-1"> "With their images why have they vexed Me– 

<p class="indent-2"> With futile foreign gods?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all unsaved are we." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For the daughter of my people, 

<p class="indent-2"> All broken, mine own heart is broken; 

<p class="indent-1"> I go about in mourning, 

<p class="indent-2"> With the clutch of horror upon me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Is there no balm in Gilead? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is there no physician there? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why cometh then no healing 

<p class="indent-2"> To the daughter of my people? 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 9]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  O that my head were waters, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mine eyes a fountain of tears, 

<p class="indent-1"> That day and night I might weep 

<p class="indent-2"> For the slain of the daughter of my people! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  O that I had in the desert 

<p class="indent-2"> A spot such as travellers lodge in; 

<p class="indent-1"> For then would I leave my people, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea, from them I would go; 

<p class="indent-1"> For they be all adulterers, 

<p class="indent-2"> A company of traitors, 

<p class="indent-2"> That bend their tongue like a bow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  It is not the true, but the false, 

<p class="indent-2"> That has mastery in the land; 

<p class="indent-1"> For they pass from evil to evil, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they know not Me, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Let each man beware of his neighbour, 

<p class="indent-2"> And trust not any brother: 

<p class="indent-1"> For brothers are tricksters, all of them, 

<p class="indent-2"> And neighbours are slanderers all. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They all deceive one another, 

<p class="indent-2"> The truth they will not speak; 

<p class="indent-1"> They have taught their tongue to lie, 

<p class="indent-2"> They behave like knaves and fools. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Oppression upon oppression, 

<p class="indent-2"> Deceit upon deceit: 

<p class="indent-2"> They refuse, saith Jehovah, to know Me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> Behold I will smelt them and test them, 

<p class="indent-1"> For alas! I must turn Mine eyes away 

<p class="indent-2"> From the daughter of My people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Their tongue is a deadly arrow, 

<p class="indent-2"> The words of their mouth are deceit; 

<p class="indent-1"> They speak their neighbour fair, 

<p class="indent-2"> But at heart they are laying a trap for him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And crimes like these, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Am I to leave unpunished? 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall not My soul be avenged 

<p class="indent-2"> On a nation such as this? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Lift a lament for the mountains, 

<p class="indent-2"> A dirge for the wilderness pastures; 

<p class="indent-1"> For wasted they lie and untraversed, 

<p class="indent-2"> No lowing of cattle they hear: 

<p class="indent-1"> The birds of the air and the beasts 

<p class="indent-2"> Are fled away and gone. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I will make of Jerusalem ruins, 

<p class="indent-2"> A place for jackals to haunt; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will make of the cities of judah 

<p class="indent-2"> An uninhabited waste. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Where is the man that Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> Himself hath communed with and charged 

<p class="indent-1"> To declare why the land us a ruin, 

<p class="indent-2"> Laid waste like the untravelled wilderness? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And Jehovah said unto me: 

<p class="indent-1"> Because they forsook My law 

<p class="indent-2"> Which I had set before them, 

<p class="indent-1"> And did not live thereby, 

<p class="indent-2"> But disobeyed My voice, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And followed their stubborn hearts, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the Baals that their fathers had taught them: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> The God of Israel; Behold, 

<p class="indent-1"> I will feed this people with wormwood, 

<p class="indent-2"> And give them gall to drink. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I will scatter them far among nations 

<p class="indent-2"> To them and their fathers unknown; 

<p class="indent-1"> The sword I will send to pursue them, 

<p class="indent-2"> Until I have clean consumed them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: 

<p class="indent-1"> Now mark ye well and summon 

<p class="indent-2"> The women that chant in dirges; 

<p class="indent-1"> And send for the skillful women, 

<p class="indent-2"> That they may come in haste, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And lift up for us a lament; 

<p class="indent-1"> That our eyes may run with tears, 

<p class="indent-2"> And our eyelids gush with water. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Hark! from Zion float sounds of wailing, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Alas!how are we spoiled; 

<p class="indent-1"> We are put to utter shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because we have left the land, 

<p class="indent-2"> And our homes are hurled to the ground." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Hear then, ye women, the word of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Received with your ears the word of His mouth, 

<p class="indent-1"> And teach this lament to your daughters, 

<p class="indent-2"> Each one to her neighbour this dirge: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  "Death hath climbed up to our windows, 

<p class="indent-2"> And into our palaces entered, 

<p class="indent-1"> sweeping the child from the streets 

<p class="indent-2"> And the youth from the broad open spaces. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The corpses of men are fallen 

<p class="indent-2"> Like dung on the face of the field; 

<p class="indent-1"> Or like sheaves behind the reaper, 

<p class="indent-2"> With none to gather them up." 

<h4>The True Glory of a Man</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Let the wise man not boast of his wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> Let the strong man not boast of his strength; 

<p class="indent-1"> Let the rich man not boast of his riches, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But in this be the boaster’s boast– 

<p><p class="indent-2"> In insight and knowledge of Me 

<p class="indent-2"> As Jehovah, who over the earth 

<p class="indent-1"> Doeth kindness and justice and right; 

<p class="indent-2"> For these are the things that I love. 

<h4>The Necessity for Circumcision of Heart</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Mark this well, saith Jehovah: days are coming  when I will punish all those that, though circumcised  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  (in flesh) are uncircumcised (in heart) – Egypt, Judah,  Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all those denizens of the  wilderness that have the corners of their hair clipped;  for while all the nations are uncircumcised, the whole  household of Israel is uncircumcised in heart. 

<h4>The Approaching Doom of Exile</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 10]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Take up thy pack from the ground, 

<p class="indent-2"> (O Jerusalem), that sittest beleaguered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, 

<p class="indent-1"> This time I will surely sling out 

<p class="indent-2"> The inhabitants of the land, 

<p class="indent-1"> And bring them into such straits 

<p class="indent-2"> That they shall melt for fear. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Ah! woe is me! I am broken, 

<p class="indent-2"> And smitten very sore, 

<p class="indent-1"> "Yes, this is a stroke indeed," 

<p class="indent-2"> Said I, "and I must bear it. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  My tent is despoiled and perished, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all my cords are broken; 

<p class="indent-2"> My flock is vanished clean. 

<p class="indent-1"> There is none to stretch my tent, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or to hang up my curtains more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For the shepherds are foolish grown, 

<p class="indent-2"> And nothing they care for Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> For this cause they have not prospered, 

<p class="indent-2"> And all their flock is scattered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Hark! a rumour! behold, it cometh, 

<p class="indent-2"> A mighty uproar from the land of the north, 

<p class="indent-1"> It shall make of the cities of Judah a waste, 

<p class="indent-2"> A place to be haunted of jackals. 

<h4>Prayer that Judgment may be Tempered with Mercy</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Well, O Jehovah, I know 

<p class="indent-2"> That a man’s way lies not with himself;` 

<p class="indent-1"> It is not in the power of man 

<p class="indent-2"> To walk and direct his steps. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When therefore Thou chastenest us, 

<p class="indent-2"> Do Thou deal, O Jehovah, in measure, 

<p class="indent-1"> And not in Thine indignation; 

<p class="indent-2"> For so wouldst Thou bring us to nothing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Pour out Thy wrath on the heathen, 

<p class="indent-2"> That have not cared for Thee– 

<p class="indent-2"> And on tribes that invoke not Thy name; 

<p class="indent-1"> For Jacob they have devoured, 

<p class="indent-2"> They have desolated his dwelling. 

<h4>The Folly of Fearing the Impotent and Unreal Gods of the Heathen</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 10]</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Listen, O household of Israel, to the word which Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  hath spoken to you. Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Learn not the ways of the heathen, 

<p class="indent-2"> And be not dismayed at the signs in the sky, 

<p class="indent-1"> As the heathen are dismayed; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For heathen religion is vapour. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> A tree is cut down in the forest 

<p class="indent-2"> And fashioned by craftsman’s axe, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4a]</span>  Adorned with silver and gold– 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  With silver beat fine, brought from Tarshish, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> And gold that cometh form Ophir– 

<p class="indent-2"> And wrought by the craftsman and goldsmith, 

<p class="indent-1"> And robed in blue and in purple– 

<p class="indent-2"> The work of skilled men are they all– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4b]</span>  And fastened with nails and hammers, 

<p class="indent-2"> To keep them from toppling over. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They are altogether dumb, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a scarecrow in garden of cucumbers; 

<p class="indent-1"> Carried they must needs be, 

<p class="indent-2"> For they cannot go of themselves. 

<p class="indent-1"> Be not afraid of them, then, 

<p class="indent-2"> For they have it not in their power 

<p class="indent-2"> To do either good or harm. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There is none like Thee, O Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou art great, and great is Thy name in might. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Who should not fear Thee, O King of the nations? 

<p class="indent-2"> For Thee it becometh well;

<p class="indent-2"> There is none that is like unto Thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  One and all, they are senseless and silly, 

<p class="indent-2"> Instructed of gods that are wooden. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Jehovah is God indeed, 

<p class="indent-2"> A living God, and a King everlasting; 

<p class="indent-1"> The earth at His wrath doth tremble,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He created the earth by His power,

<p class="indent-2"> He stretched out the heavens by His skill. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When He uttereth His voice, 

<p class="indent-2"> The waters roar in the heavens, 

<p class="indent-1"> And He causeth vapour to rise 

<p class="indent-2"> From the uttermost ends of the earth. 

<p class="indent-1"> Lightnings He made for the rain, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the wind He brings out of His storehouses. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  How foolish is man with his knowledge! 

<p class="indent-2"> The goldsmith is shamed by his image; 

<p class="indent-1"> His idols are delusion,

<p class="indent-2"> In the hour of their trial they shall perish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Not such is the Portion of Jacob, 

<p class="indent-2"> His God is the Framer of all things:

<h4>Jeremiah Exhorts the People to be True to the Demands of the Deuteronomic Law</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  "Listen to the words of this covenant, and declare  them to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jerusalem. Say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God  of Israel: Accursed be the man that refuses to listen  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  to the words of the covenant with which I charged your  forefathers on the day that I brought them out of that  iron furnace, the land of Egypt. I promised them then  that, if they obeyed My voice, and conformed to all  My commandments, they should be My people and I  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  would be their God, and thus the oath would be estab-  lished that swore to their forefathers – to give them  a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."  Then I answered and said, "Amen, Jehovah." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jehovah then said to me, "Make this proclamation  throughout the cities of Judah and in the streets of  Jerusalem: Listen to the words of this covenant and  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  act upon them. For early and late, ever since the day  that I brought your forefathers out of the land of  Egypt up to this day, I have been earnestly adjuring  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  them to listen to My voice; but instead of obediently  inclining their ear, every man of them followed the  dictates of his own wicked and stubborn heart; so I  brought upon them all the threats of this covenant  which I had charged them to observe, but which they  failed to observe." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Further Jehovah said to me, "The people of Judah  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been engaged in  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  a manifest conspiracy (against Me). They have  reverted to the sins of their forefathers who refused to  listen to My words, and they are actually indulging in  the worship of other gods: the households of Israel  and Judah alike have broken the covenant I made with  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  their forefathers. Therefore thus saith Jehovah:  Mark this – I will bring upon them a disaster which they  shall be powerless to escape; and when they cry to Me, U  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  will turn a deaf ear. Then the cities of Judah and the  inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods to  whom they burn sacrifice; but no help shall they get  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  from them in the day of their calamity: for your gods,  O Judah, are as numerous as your cities; and as  numerous as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you  have set up for sacrifice in the scandalous worship  of the Baal. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raise  no cry or prayer on their behalf; for I will not listed  when they call to Me in the day of their calamity. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What business hath My Beloved 

<p class="indent-2"> In My house, after conduct so vile? 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall vows and the sacred flesh 

<p class="indent-2"> Avert from thee thy doom 

<p class="indent-2"> Then mightest thou rejoice. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  A spreading, graceful olive 

<p class="indent-2"> Jehovah had called thy name; 

<p class="indent-1"> But to the roar of a mighty storm 

<p class="indent-2"> He hath set it ablaze with lightning, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the branches thereof are marred. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For Jehovah of Hosts that planted thee hath pro-  nounced evil against thee in requital for th evil in which  the households of Israel and Judah have vexatiously  indulged, by burning sacrifice to the Baal." 

<h4>A Plot against Jeremiah’s Life</h4>

<h5>The plot</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I knew – for Jehovah had told me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And revealed to me what they were doing: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But I – like an innocent lamb 

<p class="indent-2"> That is led to the slaughter was I. 

<p class="indent-1"> Yea, all unconscious was I 

<p class="indent-2"> Of the plots they were plotting against me– 

<p class="indent-2"> To ruin the tree with its sap, 

<p class="indent-1"> From the land of the living to root me 

<p class="indent-2"> And banish my name out of mind. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But Jehovah of Hosts, Thou righteous Judge, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who mind and heart dost prove, 

<p class="indent-1"> Let me see Thy vengeance upon them, 

<p class="indent-2"> For on Thee have I rolled my cause. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Therefore, thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of 

<p class="indent-1"> Anathoth who seek thy life and threaten thee with 

<p class="indent-1"> death at their hands, if thou preach in the name of 

<p class="indent-1"> Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Therefore saith Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> Behold I will visit them sternly; 

<p class="indent-1"> Their young men shall die by the sword, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their sons and their daughters shall perish with hunger. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Not one of them shall be left; 

<p class="indent-2"> For over the men of Anathoth 

<p class="indent-1"> Calamity I will bring 

<p class="indent-2"> In the year of their visitation. 

<h5>Jeremiah’s Persplexity and Prayer for Vengeance</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 12]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  "Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> when I make my plaint unto Thee; 

<p class="indent-2"> Yet the case I would reason with Thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> Why do the wicked prosper? 

<p class="indent-2"> And why do the faithless all flourish? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Thou plantest them, yea, they take root; 

<p class="indent-2"> They spread, yea, they bring forth fruit. 

<p class="indent-1"> You are always on their lips, 

<p class="indent-2"> But far, far away from their hearts. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But Thou, O Jehovah, dost know me, 

<p class="indent-2"> My heart towards Thee Thou hast proved. 

<p class="indent-1"> Pull them out, then, like sheep for the slaughter, 

<p class="indent-2"> To the day of slaughter devote them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  How long must the land still mourn, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the herbs of the fields be all withered? 

<p class="indent-1"> Beast and bid are vanished, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of the sin of her people, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who think God is blind to their ways." 

<h5>The Divine Answer</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  "If thy race with the footmen hath wearied thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> How wilt thou vie with the horse? 

<p class="indent-1"> If thou takest to flight in a land that is safe, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then how wilt thou do on the jungle of Jordan? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For thy father’s household, thine own very brethren, 

<p class="indent-2"> Even they have played thee false. 

<p class="indent-1"> They pursue thee with clamours loud: 

<p class="indent-2"> Trust them not, when they speak thee fair." 

<h4>Lament over the Havoc wrought upon Judah by her Neighbours</h4>

<h5>The Havoc</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  My house I have forsaken, 

<p class="indent-2"> My heritage I have cast off; 

<p class="indent-1"> Into the hands of her foes 

<p class="indent-2"> I have given the Beloved of My soul. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  My darling is grown to Me (fierce) 

<p class="indent-2"> As a lion in the jungle; 

<p class="indent-1"> She hath lifted her voice against Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And therefore I abhor her. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Is My darling a speckled bird, 

<p class="indent-2"> That the birds circle round and assail her? 

<p class="indent-1"> Come, all ye beasts of the field,

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Shepherds many have ruined My vineyard, 

<p class="indent-2"> And trampled My ground under foot; 

<p class="indent-1"> They have turned My pleasant inheritance 

<p class="indent-2"> Into a desolate wilderness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They have made it a desolation, 

<p class="indent-2"> It mourneth, ah me! all desolate. 

<p class="indent-1"> Desolate all is the land, 

<p class="indent-2"> But no one cares. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Upon all the bare heights in the wilderness 

<p class="indent-2"> Spoilers have descended; 

<p class="indent-1"> For the sword of Jehovah devours 

<p class="indent-2"> From one end of the land to another; 

<p class="indent-2"> No peace is there for any. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Wheat they have sown, but thorns they have reaped; 

<p class="indent-2"> Their labour hath profited nothing; 

<p class="indent-1"> Their harvest shall bring them to shame, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of Jehovah’s hot anger. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  This is the word of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> To all Mine evil neighbours 

<p class="indent-1"> That put forth a hand on the heritage 

<p class="indent-2"> I gave to My people Israel. 

<p class="indent-1"> Behold! I will pluck them away from their land, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the household of Judah I pluck from the midst of them; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But when thus I have plucked them away, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will once more take pity upon them, 

<p class="indent-1"> And bring each man back to his heritage, 

<p class="indent-2"> Each to his own land again. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And if ever they master the ways of My people, 

<p class="indent-2"> To swear by My name, "As Jehovah liveth," 

<p class="indent-1"> As they once taught My people to swear by the Baal, 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall then be built up in the midst of My people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But the nation that will not listen, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will pluck clean away and destroy, saith Jehovah. 

<h4>The Parable of the Waistcloth</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jehovah told me to go and buy a linen waistcloth and  put it on my loins, taking care not to let it get into  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  water. So I bought a waistcloth, as Jehovah had  bidden me, and I put it on my loins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then a second message from Jehovah came to me,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  telling me to take the waistcloth I had bought, that  was on my loins, and to proceed to Parah and bury it  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  there in a chink of the rock. So I went and burried it  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  at Parah, as Jehovah had charged me. Many days  after, Jehovah told me to proceed to Parah and remove  the waistcloth which He had charged me to bury there.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then I went to Parah and dug out and took the linen  waistcloth from the place where I had buried it; and  lo! the waistcloth was ruined – it was good for  nothing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then there came to me this word from Jehovah:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah, Ruin like this I will bring upon the  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  soaring pride of Judah and Jerusalem. As for these  depraved people who, refusing to listen to My words,  follow the dictates of their own stubborn hearts and  indulge in the worship and service of other gods – let  them become like this waistcloth, good for nothing.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For, as the waistcloth clings to a man’s loins, so would  I have had the whole household of Israel and Judah  cling unto Me, saith Jehovah, to be My people, a  source of renown and praise and glory: but they would  not listen. 

<h4>The Parable of the Jars</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Take to them therefore this message: Thus saith  Jehovah the God of Israel, "Every jar must be filled with  wine." And if they say to thee, "Why, of course we  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  know that every jar must be filled with wine," then this  is what thou shalt say to them: Thus saith Jehovah:  Soon-mark it well-I will fill with drunkenness all  the inhabitants of this land – the kings that sit upon  the throne of David, the priests, the prophets, and all  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will dash them,  saith Jehovah, one against another, fathers and sons  together. I will neither spare nor pity: no compassion  shall restrain Me from destroying them. 

<h4>The Tender Solemn Warning</h4>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  O hear and give ear, be not haughty; 

<p class="indent-2"> Jehovah hath spoken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To Jehovah your God give ye glory, 

<p class="indent-2"> Before it grows dark, 

<p class="indent-1"> And ere yet, on the mountains of twilight, 

<p class="indent-2"> With feet that are stumbling, 

<p class="indent-1"> Ye look for the light, which to gloom 

<p class="indent-2"> And thick darkness He turneth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But should ye refuse to give heed, 

<p class="indent-1"> Then in secret my soul shall weep, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of your pride: 

<p class="indent-1"> And with tears that flow ever and ever 

<p class="indent-2"> Mine eyes shall run down 

<p class="indent-1"> For the flock of Jehovah, afar 

<p class="indent-2"> To captivity taken. 

<h4>Lament on the Approaching Fate of King Jehoiachin and the Queen Mother</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Say to the King and the Queen Mother, 

<p class="indent-2"> Low ye be seated; 

<p class="indent-1"> For down from your head hath been hurled 

<p class="indent-2"> Your glorious crown. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The towns in the south land are shut, 

<p class="indent-2"> There is no one to open them; 

<p class="indent-1"> All Judah is swept into exile, 

<p class="indent-2"> Swept all into exile. 

<h4>Lament over the Sin and the Doom of Jerusalem</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Jerusalem, lift up thine eyes and behold 

<p class="indent-2"> How they come from the north. 

<p class="indent-1"> Where is thy beautiful flock, 

<p class="indent-2"> Even the sheep that were given thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  What wilt thou say when He calleth– 

<p class="indent-2"> To lord over thee– 

<p class="indent-1"> The men thou thyself didst instruct 

<p class="indent-2"> To approach thee as lovers? 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall anguish not clutch at thee hard 

<p class="indent-2"> As of woman in travail? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But if in thy heart thou shouldst say, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Why is this come upon me?" 

<p class="indent-1"> Thy manifold guilt is the cause 

<p class="indent-2"> That thy skirts are stripped off 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy modesty outraged. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Can the African change his skin, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or the leopard his spots? 

<p class="indent-1"> Just as helpless art thou to do good 

<p class="indent-2"> That art wont to do evil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And so to the winds of the desert 

<p class="indent-2"> Like stubble that flies I will scatter them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  This is thy lot, this the portion 

<p class="indent-2"> I measure to thee, saith Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> Because thou forgattest Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hast trusted in falsehood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Thy skirt I Myself will lift over thy face, 

<p class="indent-2"> That thy shame may be seen. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Thine adulteries and thy neighings, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy harlotry foul– 

<p class="indent-1"> In the field, on the hills, I have seen– 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy detestable doings. 

<p class="indent-1"> Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! 

<p class="indent-1"> How long time yet must pass 

<p class="indent-2"> Until thou be cleansed? 

<h4>A Grievous Drought and the Thoughts it Awakened in the Prophet</h4>

<h5>The Distress of the Drought</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 14]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came from Jehovah to Jeremiah 

<p class="indent-2"> with regard to the drought. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Judah doth mourn, and the gates thereof languish; 

<p class="indent-2"> (Her people) are sitting in black on the ground, 

<p class="indent-2"> And a cry rises up from Jerusalem. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Her nobles have sent their attendants for water; 

<p class="indent-2"> They come to the cisterns, no water they find: 

<p class="indent-1"> Back then they go with their pitches empty, 

<p class="indent-2"> In shame and confusion they cover their heads. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Dismayed are the men that till the ground, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because on the land no rain hath fallen; 

<p class="indent-2"> The ploughmen cover their heads in confusion. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yea, even the hind in the field forsaketh 

<p class="indent-2"> The young that she bore, because grass there is none. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And the wild asses stand on the bleak bare heights, 

<p class="indent-2"> Panting for air, like the crocodile, 

<p class="indent-1"> And the light dieth out of their eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because herbage there is none. 

<h5>The Prophet’s Supplication</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And yet though our sins rise in witness against us, 

<p class="indent-2"> Jehovah, O act, for Thine own name’s sake; 

<p class="indent-1"> For many a time have we turned from Thee back, 

<p class="indent-2"> And against Thee we have sinned. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  O Thou that art Israel’s Hope, 

<p class="indent-2"> Her Saviour in time of trouble, 

<p class="indent-1"> Why like a stranger art Thou in Thy land, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a traveller who turneth to lodge but a night? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Why shouldst Thou be like a man fast asleep, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a warrior powerless to save? 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet Thou, O Jehovah, art here in our midst, 

<p class="indent-2"> By thy name we are called: O leave us not. 

<h5>The Divine Answer</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Touching this people Jehovah thus answered: 

<p class="indent-1"> Thus do they love to wander 

<p class="indent-2"> With unrestrained feet, 

<p class="indent-2"> But Jehovah cannot accept them: 

<p class="indent-1"> Their guilt He now calleth to mind, 

<p class="indent-2"> Their sins He will visit with chastisement. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And Jehovah said to me: Offer no prayer for the 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  welfare of this people. When they fast, I will be deaf 

<p class="indent-1"> to their cry; when they offer burnt-offerings and 

<p class="indent-1"> cereal offerings, I will not accept them. By sword, 

<p class="indent-1"> by famine, by pestilence, I will consume them. 

<h5>The Prophet’s Remonstrance</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  To this I made answer: Oh! Lord Jehovah, see!  The prophets are ceaselessly telling them that they will  never see the sword or suffer from famine, but that  Thou wilt bestow upon them stable peace in this place. 

<h5>The Divine Answer</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Jehovah said to me: The prophets are but  preaching lies in My name. I never sent them; they  have no commission from Me; not a word have I  spoken to them. What thy preach to you is nothing  but a tissue of lying visions and idle divinations and  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  inventions of their own deceitful hearts. This there-  fore is the message of Jehovah concerning those  prophets who, without any commision from Me, are  ceaselessly preaching that this land will never suffer  from sword or famine: by sword and famine shall  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  those very prophets themselves be consumed, and the  people they preach to shall be flung out in the streets  of Jerusalem as victims of sword and famine, and they  shall lie unburied – themselves, their wives, their sons,  their daughters; for I will pour their wickedness over  them. 

<h5>The Prophet’s Lament and Confession</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This is the word thou shalt speak to them: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Mine eyes run down with tears 

<p class="indent-2"> By night and day unceasing; 

<p class="indent-1"> For the daughters of my people 

<p class="indent-2"> Is broken, grievously broken, 

<p class="indent-2"> With a wound exceeding sore. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If to the field I go forth, 

<p class="indent-2"> Lo, the slain of the sword lie there; 

<p class="indent-1"> And if into the city I go, 

<p class="indent-2"> Lo, there lie the victims of famine: 

<p class="indent-1"> Yea, prophet and priest alike, 

<p class="indent-2"> All wiltless, lie crouched on the ground, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Hast Thou utterly cast away Judah? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is Zion grown loathsome to Thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why hast Thou smitten us so, 

<p class="indent-2"> That we can find no healing? 

<p class="indent-1"> We look for peace, but no good cometh: 

<p class="indent-2"> For a season of healing, but lo! dismay. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  We acknowledge, Jehovah, our wickedness, 

<p class="indent-2"> The guilt of our fathers also; 

<p class="indent-2"> For we have sinned against Thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For Thy name’s sake, O spurn us not, 

<p class="indent-2"> O shame not Thy glorious throne: 

<p class="indent-2"> O remember and break out Thy covenant with us. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Of the worthless gods of the heathen 

<p class="indent-2"> Is there one that can bring down rain? 

<p class="indent-2"> Can the sky give showers of itself? 

<p class="indent-1"> Is it not Thou alone that canst do this– 

<p class="indent-2"> Jehovah, our God, whom we wait for? 

<p class="indent-2"> Yea, these things are all Thy creation. 

<h5>The Divine Answer – Rejection and Doom</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 15]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Jehovah said to me: 

<p class="indent-1"> Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet no learning of heart could I have for this people; 

<p class="indent-2"> Away with them out of My sight – let them go. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When they ask thee where they shall go, 

<p class="indent-2"> Then say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> To death, those destined to death; 

<p class="indent-2"> To the sword, those doomed to the sword; 

<p class="indent-1"> To famine, those destined to famine, 

<p class="indent-2"> To exile, those destined to exile. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And I, saith Jehovah, will set over them four kinds 

<p class="indent-1"> (of destroyers) – the sword to slay, the dogs to tear, 

<p class="indent-1"> the birds of the air to devour, and the beasts of the 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  earth to destroy; and I will make them an object of 

<p class="indent-1"> Consternation to every kingdom in the world, in return 

<p class="indent-1"> for all the evil wrought in Jerusalem by Manasseh, 

<p class="indent-1"> the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  O Jerusalem, who will then pity thee? 

<p class="indent-2"> Who will commiserate thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> Who will go out of his way 

<p class="indent-2"> To enquire how it fareth with thee? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Thou hast cast Me off, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou ever wentest backward; 

<p class="indent-1"> So, weary at length of relenting, 

<p class="indent-2"> I stretch out My hand to destroy thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  With winnowing-fork I will winnow thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> In every gate of the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> I will make My people childless, 

<p class="indent-2"> And destroy them because of their wickedness, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8c]</span>  A destroyer I will bring 

<p class="indent-2"> Upon mother and suckling at noon-day; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will bring of a sudden upon her 

<p class="indent-2"> Agitation and dismay. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The mother of seven shall languish, 

<p class="indent-2"> And she shall swoon away; 

<p class="indent-1"> Her sun shall go down in the day-time, 

<p class="indent-2"> Ashamed and abashed shall she be. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8a]</span>  Their widows are more in number 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[b]</span>  Than the sand of all the seas, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9e]</span>  And the rest of them I will deliver 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[f]</span>  To the sword in the face of their foes. 

<h5>The Prophet’s Passionate Lament</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Alas for me! mother of mine, that bore me 

<p class="indent-2"> To strive and to struggle with all the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> Never lender nor borrower was I, 

<p class="indent-2"> Yet one and all they curse me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To their curses be "Amen, Jehovah," 

<p class="indent-2"> If ever I failed to entreat Thee 

<p class="indent-1"> For a blessing upon my foes 

<p class="indent-2"> In their time of distress and disaster. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Is the arm in my shoulder of iron? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or is my brow of brass? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  O Jehovah, remember and visit me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Avenge me of my tormentors; 

<p class="indent-1"> Let not Thine anger tarry. 

<p class="indent-2"> Bethink Thee – it is in Thy cause 

<p class="indent-1"> That I have been laden with insult. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They spurn Thy words – every man of them. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> But to me is Thy word a delight, 

<p class="indent-2"> The very joy of my heart; 

<p class="indent-1"> For I have been called by Thy name, 

<p class="indent-2"> O Jehovah, Thou God of Hosts. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  No happy seat was mine 

<p class="indent-2"> At gatherings of the merry; 

<p class="indent-1"> But lonely I sat, for Thy hand was upon me: 

<p class="indent-2"> With (holy) wrath Thou hast filled me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Oh why is my pain unceasing? 

<p class="indent-2"> And why is this wound of mine cureless? 

<p class="indent-1"> Like a treacherous brook wilt Thou be unto me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like waters that are unsure? 

<h5>The Divine Answer</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Thus therefore saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> If thou turn again, I will restore thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thou shalt be My servant. 

<p class="indent-1"> Let thy speech but be noble, not petty, 

<p class="indent-2"> And so thou shalt be My mouthpiece; 

<p class="indent-1"> They then may turn unto thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> But thou shalt not turn unto them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And unto this folk I will make thee 

<p class="indent-2"> A fortified wall of bronze. 

<p class="indent-1"> They will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor; 

<p class="indent-2"> For I will be with thee to save thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And rescue thee – thus saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Yes, I from the land of the wicked will rescue thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> I from the clutch of the cruel will redeem thee. 

<h4>Predictions of Coming Disaster</h4>

<h5>The Prophet’s Unutterable Loneliness</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 16]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  There came to me this message from Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Thou shalt not take thee a wife, 

<p class="indent-2"> Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel; 

<p class="indent-1"> Nor shalt thou have any sons 

<p class="indent-2"> Or daughters in this place. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For thus Jehovah saith 

<p class="indent-2"> Concerning the sons and the daughters 

<p class="indent-2"> That in this place are born, 

<p class="indent-1"> And concerning the mothers that bore them, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the fathers that begat them: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  "A grievous death shall they die, 

<p class="indent-2"> Unburied, unlamented; 

<p class="indent-1"> Like dung on the face of the field shall they be, 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall perish by sword and famine; 

<p class="indent-1"> By the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall their corpses be devoured." 

<h5>The National Doom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For thus Jehovah saith: 

<p class="indent-2"> Do not enter the house of grief, 

<p class="indent-1"> Nor go to make lament, 

<p class="indent-2"> And raise for them no wailing; 

<p class="indent-1"> Because from this (My) people 

<p class="indent-2"> I have taken away My peace. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Both great and small in this land shall die, 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall be unburried, unmourned; 

<p class="indent-1"> Not a man shall gash his body, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or shear his hair for them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  No bread shall be broken for mourners, 

<p class="indent-2"> To comfort them for the dead; 

<p class="indent-1"> Nor shall cup of consolation 

<p class="indent-2"> Be given for father or mother. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Do not enter the house of feasting, 

<p class="indent-2"> To sit with them, eating and drinking. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> The God of Israel: 

<p class="indent-1"> Mark this – ye shall live to see it– 

<p class="indent-2"> This place I will bring to silence, 

<p class="indent-1"> The voice of mirth and gladness, 

<p class="indent-2"> The voice of bridegroom and bride. 

<h5>The Infidelity which Justifies the Doom</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  After thou hast delivered this message to the people,  they will ask thee why Jehovah has doomed them to all  this misery. "What is our guilt," they will say, "and  what is the sin we have committed against Jehovah our  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  God?" Tell them then, "Jehovah doth solemnly  declare: it is because your fathers abandoned Me  for the worship and the service of other gods; yes,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  they abandoned Me and neglected My law. And  your own behaviour has been worse than that of your  fathers. See how every man of you is following the  impulses of his own wicked and stubborn heart and  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  refusing to listen to Me. For this, then, I will hurl you  out of this land into a land that is strange to you and  your fathers; and there, day and night, ye shall serve  other gods; for no favour shall ye have from Me." 

<h5>The Doom</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Behold, I will send many fishers, 

<p class="indent-2"> And them they shall fish, saith Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> And then will I send many hunters, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they shall hunt them down 

<p class="indent-1"> From every mountain and hill 

<p class="indent-2"> And out of the clefts of the rocks. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For Mine eyes are all their ways, 

<p class="indent-2"> From My face they are not concealed, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their guilt is not hid from Mine eyes. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I will therefore requite them double 

<p class="indent-2"> For all their guilt and sin, 

<p class="indent-1"> In profaning My land with the carcases 

<p class="indent-2"> Of their detestable idols, 

<p class="indent-1"> And filling Mine inheritance 

<p class="indent-2"> With their abominations. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  See then! I wil give them to feel– 

<p class="indent-2"> This once I will give them to feel– 

<p class="indent-1"> The weight of My mighty hand: 

<p class="indent-2"> And then shall they know that My name is Jehovah. 

<h5>Ultimate Recognition by the Heathen of Jehovah as the True God</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold, 

<p class="indent-2"> My refuge in time of trouble, 

<p class="indent-1"> To Thee from the ends of the earth 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall nations come and say, 

<p class="indent-1"> "Only lies have our fathers inherited, 

<p class="indent-2"> Empty and useless (idols)." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Shall a man make gods for himself, 

<p class="indent-2"> Which yet are no gods at all? 

<h5>The Doom</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 17]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The sin of Judah is written 

<p class="indent-2"> With pencil of iron; 

<p class="indent-1"> With diamond point it is graven 

<p class="indent-2"> On the tablet of their heart, 

<p class="indent-1"> On the horns of their altars, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  On every green tree, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> On every high hill, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  On the heights in the field. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Thy substance and all thy treasures 

<p class="indent-2"> As spoil I will give, 

<p class="indent-1"> In requital for all the sins 

<p class="indent-2"> That pervaded thy borders. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And then thou shalt slack thy hold 

<p class="indent-2"> Of the land that I gave thee: 

<p class="indent-1"> I will make thee the slave of thy foes 

<p class="indent-2"> In a land that is strange to thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> For a fire in Mine anger is kindled 

<p class="indent-2"> That burneth for ever. 

<h4>The Joy and Wisdom of Trust</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Accursed the man that trusteth in man, 

<p class="indent-2"> And maketh flesh his arm, 

<p class="indent-2"> While his heart is estranged from Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Like a bare desert shrub shall he be, 

<p class="indent-2"> No destiny fair shall be his; 

<p class="indent-1"> His home is the scorching wilderness, 

<p class="indent-2"> A salt uninhabited land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But blessed the man that trusteth Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> That maketh Jehovah his confidence; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Like a tree shall he be, by the waters planted, 

<p class="indent-2"> That stretcheth its roots out towards the stream, 

<p class="indent-1"> And is never afraid for the coming of heat, 

<p class="indent-2"> But its leaves are for ever green– 

<p class="indent-1"> In the year of drought untroubled– 

<p class="indent-2"> And it yeildeth fruit without ceasing. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Like a patridge that sitteth on eggs 

<p class="indent-2"> That it hath not laid, 

<p class="indent-1"> Is the man that getteth him riches 

<p class="indent-2"> In ways unjust. 

<p class="indent-1"> In the midst of his days he must leave them, 

<p class="indent-2"> His end shall declare him a fool. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  A glorious throne, set on high from of old, 

<p class="indent-2"> Is the site where standeth our holy place. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  O Jehovah, Thou Hope of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> Put to shame shall all be that forsake Thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> Yea, they that prove faithless to Thee 

<p class="indent-2"> In the land shall be put to confussion; 

<p class="indent-1"> Because they have forsaken 

<p class="indent-2"> The Fountain of Living Water. 

<h4>The Prophet’s Prayer</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  "The heart is most treacherous of all things, 

<p class="indent-2"> And sick beyond cure: who cah know it?" 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  "I, Jehovah, am Searcher of hearts, 

<p class="indent-2"> And Tester of thoughts am I, 

<p class="indent-1"> To give each what his doings have earned, 

<p class="indent-2"> To let each reap the fruit of his deeds." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  "Heal me, Jehovah, and I shall be healed; 

<p class="indent-2"> Save me, and I shall be saved indeed: 

<p class="indent-2"> For Thou art my Praise. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Mark how they say to me ceaselessly 

<p class="indent-2"> ’Where is the word of Jehovah? 

<p class="indent-2"> Pray, now, let it come to pass.’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yet never for this did I urge Thee 

<p class="indent-2"> To bring on the evil day, 

<p class="indent-1"> Nor ever have longed in my heart 

<p class="indent-2"> For the day of disaster – Thou knowest. 

<p class="indent-1"> The words that came forth from my lips 

<p class="indent-2"> Lie open before Thy face. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  O be not a terror to me, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou Refuge of mine in the day of evil. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Confusion on them that torment me– 

<p class="indent-2"> On them, but not on me: 

<p class="indent-1"> Be dire dismay upon them– 

<p class="indent-2"> On them, but not on me; 

<p class="indent-1"> Bring the day of disaster upon them, 

<p class="indent-2"> With two-fold destruction destroy them." 

<h4>The Sanctity of the Sabbath</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jehovah commanded me to go and take my stand at  the Benjamin gate, through which the kings of Judah  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  go in and out, and at all the gates of Jerusalem, and  there He charged me to address them as follows: "Ye  kings of Judah, and all ye citizens of Judah and  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jerusalem that pass through these gates, Thus saith  Jehovah: As ye value you lives, be very careful not  to carry a burden or to bring anything of the kind  through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day;  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  also to carry no load out of your houses on the  Sabbath day, and to do no work of any kind, but to keep  the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But instead of obediently inclining their ear, they  stiffened their neck; they would have nothing to  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  do with obedience or discipline. If you, however,  will give earnest heed to Me, saith Jehovah, and  refrain from bringing loads through the city gates on the  Sabbath day, if you keep the Sabbath day holy and  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  abstain from work of every kind, then kings that  sit upon the throne of David shall enter the gates of  this city riding on chariots and horses, accompanied  by their princes, the men of Judah, and the citizens of  Jerusalem; and the city shall be inhabited for ever.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  From the cities of Judah, the neighbourhood of  Jerusalem, and the district of Benjamin, from the low-  land, the hill country, and the south, men shall come  to the Temple with burnt-offerings and sacrifices,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  oblations and frankincense, and praise-offerings. If,  however, you refuse to give heed to Me and to keep the  Sabbath day holy by refraining from carrying burdens  through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,  then I will kindle in her gates a fire unquenchable, that  shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 

<h4>The Lesson of the Potter and the Clay</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jeremiah received from Jehovah the message which  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  follows: "Rise and go down to the potter’s house–  I have somewhat to say to thee, which I will com-  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  municate to thee there." So I went down to the  potter’s house: and there he was-engaged on a  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  piece of work at the wheel. Now, if the thing he was  making was spoiled in his hands, he would just shape  the material over again into another such vessel as he  had decided to make. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Thereupon there flashed upon me this message from  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jehovah. "Cannot I," He said, "deal with you,  O household of Israel, like this potter? You are  in My hand just like the clay in the potter’s hand.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  At one moment I may decide to pluck up or break  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  down and destroy some nation of kingdom; but  if the nation whose fate I have decreed turn from its  wickedness, then I relent and do not execute the doom  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I had planned for it. At another moment I may  decide to build up or to plant some nation of kingdom;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  but if its behaviour displeases Me, if it refuses to listen  to My voice, then I will retract the favours I had  intended to confer upon it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Now, therefore, make this announcement to the men  of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, Thus saith  Jehovah: Beware! I am shaping calamity for you, I  am fashioning plans for your discomfiture. Turn, then,  every man of you, from your evil ways, and amend your  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  life and behaviour." But they will say, "No, there  is no hope of that: rather will we follow devices of our  own and yeild, every man of us, to the impulses of our  wicked and stubborn hearts."  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Thus therefore saith Jehovah: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Ask any heathen man 

<p class="indent-2"> If he ever heard aught like this? 

<p class="indent-1"> An utterly horrible thing 

<p class="indent-2"> Hath been wrought by the Virgin of Israel. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Doth the white snow vanish from Sirion’s crags? 

<p class="indent-2"> Do the rills that flow cold from the hills ever dry? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Yet Me hath My people forgotten; 

<p class="indent-2"> The gods that they worship are phantoms. 

<p class="indent-1"> They have stumbled upon the way 

<p class="indent-2"> Ordained for them of old, 

<p class="indent-1"> And turned into bypaths 

<p class="indent-2"> That never were truly laid. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So their land shall be made a horror– 

<p class="indent-2"> An everlasting scorn. 

<p class="indent-1"> It shall fill every traveller with horror– 

<p class="indent-2"> Thereat he will shake his head, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I will scatter them like the sirocco 

<p class="indent-2"> Before the face of their foes. 

<p class="indent-1"> Not My face, but My back, will I show them, 

<p class="indent-2"> In the day of their calamity. 

<h4>Plots against Jeremiah</h4>

<h5>The Plots</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then said they, "Come, let us forge 

<p class="indent-2"> A plot against Jeremiah. 

<p class="indent-1"> For the priests will not lack for instruction to offer, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor the wise men for counsel to render, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor the prophet for words to declare. 

<p class="indent-1"> Come, with the tongue let us smite him, 

<p class="indent-2"> Let us watch him in all that he says." 

<h5>Jeremiah’s Prayer</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O Jehovah, give heed unto me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hearken to my contention. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Shall evil be rendered for good 

<p class="indent-2"> That a pit they have dug for my life? 

<p class="indent-1"> Call to mind how I stood before Thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> To utter a prayer for their welfare, 

<p class="indent-2"> And to turn Thy fury from them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Abandon Thou therefore their children to famine, 

<p class="indent-2"> Deliver them up to the sword; 

<p class="indent-1"> Let their wives become childless widows, 

<p class="indent-2"> Let their men be slain of death, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their youths may the sword smite in battle. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Let a cry ring out from their houses, 

<p class="indent-2"> When swiftly Thou bringest the raiders upon them; 

<p class="indent-1"> For a pit they have dug to take me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And snares they have hid for my feet. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For well, O Jehovah, Thou knowest 

<p class="indent-2"> How they plotted against me to slay me. 

<p class="indent-1"> O pardon not their guilt, 

<p class="indent-2"> And blot not their sin from Thy sight. 

<p class="indent-1"> Let them prostrate be hurled before Thee; 

<p class="indent-2"> Deal Thou with them in the time of Thine anger. 

<h4>The Lesson of the Broken Flask and its Consequences for Jeremiah</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 19]</p>

<h5>The Breaking of the Flask Symbolical of the Shattering of the Nation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Jehovah commanded me to go and buy a  potter’s earthenware flask, and, accompanied by a few  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  elders of the people and a few priests, to proceed  to the Valley of the son of Hinnom by the entry of the  Potsherd gate, and there announce the message with  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  which He would charge me. And the message was  this: "Listen, ye kings of Judah, and ye citizens of  Jerusalem, to what Jehovah is about to say: Thus  saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Mark  this well. I will soon bring such a catastrophe upon  this place as will make the ears of all who hear of it  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  tingle; because they have forsaken Me and de-  nationalised this place by their burnt-offerings to other  gods, strange alike to them and their forefathers;  and the kings of Judah have filled this place with the  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  blood of innocent men. They have built Baal  sanctuaries to burn their sons in the fire as offerings to  Baal, though this was no commandment of Mine – such  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  a thing never entered into My mind. Mark this,  therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah, when this  place shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valley  of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and I will spill upon the ground the wisdom of Judah  and Jerusalem in this place. I will lay them low by  the sword of their enemies and by the hands of those  that seek their life: their dead bodies I will give to the  birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And I will make this city a horror and a scorn; all  that pass by her shall be filled with horror and with  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  scorn at all the blows that I shall rain upon her. I  will drive them to eat the flesh of their sons and  daughters: in the stress of the siege to which they shall  be reduced by their enemies and by those that seek  their life, they will devour one another. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then thou shalt break the flask in the presence of  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  the men that accompany thee, and thou shalt say to  them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: This is how I will  shatter this people and this city, just as a potter’s  jar is shattered beyond all possibility of repair; and  Topheth shall be used as a burying-place for want of  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  room (elsewhere). This is how I will deal, saith  Jehovah, with this place and its inhabitants – I will  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  make this city like Topheth; and the houses of  Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah shall be, like the  place of Topheth, defiled – all the houses, that is,  from whose roofs the smoke of sacrifice has ascended  to the host of heaven, and drink-offerings have been  poured out to other gods. 

<h5>Jeremiah Put in the Stocks for his Preaching</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth to which  Jehovah had sent him on his prophetic errand; and,  taking his stand in the Temple court he thus addressed  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  the assembled people: "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel, Mark this well; soon I will bring  upon this city and upon all her villages the full measure  of disaster with which I have threatened her, because  they have stiffened their necks and refused to listen  to My words." 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 20]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now when Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest,  who had the general supervision of the Temple, heard  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  this prophetic utterance of Jeremiah’s, he beat him  and put him in the stocks that were at the upper  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Benjamin gate in the Temple. Next day, after  Pashhur had released Jeremiah from the stocks,  Jeremiah said to him, "Thy name is (henceforth)  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  changed from Pashhur to Terror. For thus saith  Jehovah: See! I will make thee a terror to thyself  and to all thy friends. They shall fall by the enemy’s  sword, and thou shalt see it with thine own eyes. I  will give the whole of Judah into the hands of the  king of Babylon, and he shall carry them to exile in  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Babylon and slay them with the sword. And all the  resources of this city, all her wealth, all that she prizes,  all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will deliver  into the hands of their enemies, who shall despoil them  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and carry them off to Babylon. As for thee, Pashhur,  thou and all who share thy home shall be swept into  captivity. To Babylon thou shalt come; there  thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried – thou  and all the friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies." 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Irresistible Impulse to Preach</h4>

<h5>What it Cost</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  O Jehovah, Thou hast beguiled me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I let myself be beguiled; 

<p class="indent-1"> Too strong for me art Thou, 

<p class="indent-2"> And Thou hast won the victory. 

<p class="indent-1"> All the day long am I ridiculed, 

<p class="indent-2"> Every one mocketh at me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Every word that I utter is laughed at; 

<p class="indent-2"> "Wronged" and "despoiled" must I cry. 

<p class="indent-1"> For to me is the word of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> An endless reproach and derision. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When I vow to put it out my mind 

<p class="indent-2"> And to speak in His name no more, 

<p class="indent-1"> It doth burn in my heart like a fire 

<p class="indent-2"> Shut up within my bones; 

<p class="indent-1"> I am weary of enduring, 

<p class="indent-2"> and I can bear it no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For I hear their many whispers– 

<p class="indent-2"> A terror on every side– 

<p class="indent-1"> "Denounce him." "Yes, we will denounce him." 

<p class="indent-2"> "All ye his familiar friends, 

<p class="indent-1"> Keep a narrow watch for his stumbling, 

<p class="indent-2"> Perchance he will be beguiled, 

<p class="indent-1"> And we shall prevail against him, 

<p class="indent-2"> And take our vengeance upon him." 

<h5>The Prophet’s Sense of Divine Support</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But Jehovah Himself is with me, 

<p class="indent-2"> As a mighty One and a terrible; 

<p class="indent-1"> So my persecutors shall stumble, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they shall not prevail; 

<p class="indent-1"> But because they have dealt unwisely, 

<p class="indent-2"> They shall come to utter shame, 

<p class="indent-1"> To perpetual confusion, 

<p class="indent-2"> Which never shall be forgotten. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  O Jehovah that triest the righteous, 

<p class="indent-2"> That mind and heart dost behold, 

<p class="indent-1"> Let me see Thy vengeance upon them; 

<p class="indent-2"> For on Thee have I rolled my cause. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Sing to Jehovah, sing praise to Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-2"> For He hath delivered the soul of the needy 

<p class="indent-2"> From the hand of evil-doers. 

<h5>The Prophet’s Despair</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  A curse on the day whereon I was born, 

<p class="indent-2"> Unblest be the day that my mother bore me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  A curse on the man who announced to my father 

<p class="indent-2"> "A man child is born to thee" – making him glad. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Let the fate of that man be the fate of the cities 

<p class="indent-2"> O’erthrown by Jehovah in pitiless anger; 

<p class="indent-1"> Let him hear in the morning a cry (of distress) 

<p class="indent-2"> And at noon the alarum of war: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  That he slew me not in the womb, 

<p class="indent-2"> So my mother had been my grave, 

<p class="indent-1"> And her womb had been great for ever. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  O why came I forth from the womb 

<p><p class="indent-1"> To behold but labour and sorrow, 

<p class="indent-2"> That my days should be wasted with shame? 

<h4>Jeremiah Warns King Zedekiah that the Babylonians will Capture Jerusalem</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 21]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,  when King Zedekiah sent the following request to him  through Pashhur, the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the son of Maaseiah the priest. "Be good enough," they  said, "to enquire of Jehovah on our behalf: for  Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon is fighting against  us. Perhaps Jehovah will so deal with us in His own  wonderful way that the siege will be raised." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  To the deputation Jeremiah replied: "Take this  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  answer back to Zedekiah. Thus saith Jehovah, the  God of Israel: Now you are able to fight outside the  wall with the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who  are besieging you; but soon I will drive you with the  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  weapons you handle inside this city. And I myself  will fight against you with outstretched hand and  mighty arm – in anger, in fury, and in towering wrath.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Yes, I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and beast, with a great and deadly pestilence. There-  after, saith Jehovah, Zedekiah, king of Judah and his  ministers and the people in this city that survive the  pestilence, sword and famine, I will deliver into the  hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into  the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of those  that seek their life; and they shall smite them with  the edge of the sword without mercy, compassion, or  pity. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  To the people thy message shall be this. Thus saith  Jehovah: See! I set before you the way of life and the  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  way of death. Whoever remains in this city shall die  by sword, famine, or pestilence; but whoever goes out  and surrenders to the Chaldeans that besiege you shall  be spared, though he shall escape with nothing but  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  his life. For, saith Jehovah, I have set My face against  this city for evil and not for good; into the hands of the  king of Babylon it shall be given, and he shall burn it  with fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To the royal house of Judah thy message shall be  this.  Hear ye the word of Jehovah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  O household of David, thus saith Jehovah:  In the morning give righteous judgment, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Deliver the man that is plundered 

<p class="indent-2"> From the clutch of his oppressor: 

<p class="indent-1"> Lest My fury break forth like fire 

<p class="indent-2"> And blaze unquenchably, 

<p class="indent-2"> Because of your evil doings. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Behold, I am against thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou denizen of the vale 

<p class="indent-2"> And the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Ye who say, ’Who can come down against us 

<p class="indent-2"> And find his way into our lairs?’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I will punish you, saith Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-2"> The fruit of your deeds ye shall reap: 

<p class="indent-1"> I will kindle a fire in her forest 

<p class="indent-2"> Which round and round will devour." 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Judgment on the Kings of Judah</h4>

<h5>Solemn Warning</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 22]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jehovah commanded me to go down to the palace  of the king of Judah and there deliver the following  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  message: O king of Judah that sittest on the throne of  David, listen to the word of Jehovah – thou and thy  ministers and thy people who enter these gates.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: Conduct your administration on  principles of justice and right, deliver the victims  of exploitation from the clutch of the oppressor, refrain  from all wrong and violence to the resident alien, the  fatherless and the widow, and shed no innocent blood  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  in this place. If you carry out this policy faithfully,  then kings upon the throne of David shall pass through t  the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  –they, their ministers and their people. But if you  ignore this message (of Mine), then, saith Jehovah, I  solemnly swear that this house shall be laid in ruins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah concerning the palace of the  king of Judah:  Though thou art to Me as Gilead, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Or the (thick-wooded) summit of Lebanon, 

<p class="indent-1"> I will turn thee into a desert, 

<p class="indent-2"> An unihabited city. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I will dedicate men to destroy thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Every one with his weapons; 

<p class="indent-1"> They shall fell thy choicest cedars, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hurl them into the fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The people of many nations, as they pass by this city,  shall ask one another why Jehovah has dealt thus with  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  this great city, and they shall answer: It is because  they abandoned their convenant with Jehovah their  God and gave themselves up to the worship and service  of other gods. 

<h5>On Jehoahaz</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Weep not for him that is dead, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mourn not for him; 

<p class="indent-1"> But weep rather for him that is gone, 

<p class="indent-2"> For he cometh no more: 

<p class="indent-1"> And the land of his birth he shall see 

<p class="indent-2"> Nevermore. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For this is the word of Jehovah concerning Shallum,  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, the successor of his  father Josiah, who went forth from this place: "He  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  shall never come back to it again; but in the land of  exile to which they have carried him he shall die, and  this land he shall see no more." 

<h5>On Jehoiakim</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his chambers by injustice, 

<p class="indent-1"> That serveth himself of his neighbour for nothing, 

<p class="indent-2"> And giveth him not his wages– 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  That saith, "I will build me a spacious house, 

<p class="indent-2"> And roomy chambers and windows broad, 

<p class="indent-1"> With panels of cedar, and painted vermilion," 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do great cedar palaces make thee a king? 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Did not thy father eat and drink, 

<p class="indent-2"> And enjoy his measure of good things? 

<p class="indent-1"> Yet justice and right did he also dispense 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And he cared for the cause of the poor and the needy. 

<p class="indent-2"> Is not that true knowledge of Me, saith Jehovah? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But thou hast neither eyes nor heart 

<p class="indent-2"> For aught save thine own mean profit, 

<p class="indent-1"> The shedding of innocent blood, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the practice of wrong and oppression. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This, therefore, is the message of Jehovah to Jehoia- 

<p class="indent-1"> kim, the son Josiah, king of Judah: 

<p class="indent-2"> Woe unto this man Jehoiakim! 

<p class="indent-1"> No one for him shall lament 

<p class="indent-2"> " O brother of mine," "O sister." 

<p class="indent-1"> No one for him shall lament 

<p class="indent-2"> "An lord!" "Alas for his glory." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But burial like that of an ass shall be his– 

<p class="indent-2"> Dragged along and flung forth 

<p class="indent-2"> Beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 

<h5>On Jehoiachin</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Get thee up tp Lebanon and cry, 

<p class="indent-2"> And lift up thy voice in Bashan; 

<p class="indent-1"> Cry from the hills of Abarim. 

<p class="indent-2"> For all that thou lovest is shattered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  In the days of good fortune I spoke to thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> But thou didst refuse to listen; 

<p class="indent-1"> And such hath thy way been from youth, 

<p class="indent-2"> To my voice thou hast never hearkened. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  All thy shepherds like sheep by the wind shall be driven, 

<p class="indent-2"> And those whom thou lovest shall captive depart; 

<p class="indent-1"> Shame and confusion shall then be thy doom, 

<p class="indent-2"> In requital for all thy wickedness. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  O thou that inhabitest Lebanon, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nestled amongst the cedars, 

<p class="indent-1"> How wilt thou groan when thy pangs come upon thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy pain as of woman in travail! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  As truly as I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah,  the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet-  ring on thy right hand, yet I would tear him off 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Yea, I will delilver thee into the hands of those that  seek thy life, and into the hands of those thou dreadest,  into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and into the hands of the Chaldeans. Yea, thee and  the mother that bore thee I will hurl into another land  than the land thou wast born in, and there thou shalt  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  die. Nevermore shall they return to the land to which  they long to return.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Hath this man Coniah become 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Like a figure one smasheth in scorn, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or a vessel that no man doth care for? 

<p class="indent-1"> Why hath he been cast forth, 

<p class="indent-2"> And hurled to a land that was strange to him? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  O land, land, land, 

<p class="indent-2"> Hear thou the word of Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Write this man down as childless; 

<p class="indent-2"> For none of his seed shall be honoured 

<p class="indent-1"> To sit on the throne of David 

<p class="indent-2"> Or rule any more over Judah. 

<h5>Unfaithful Rulers to be Succeeded by those that are Faithful</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 23]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Woe to the shepherds that ruin and scatter 

<p class="indent-2"> The flock that was theirs to pasture. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> Concerning the shepherds that tend my people: 

<p class="indent-1"> Ye have scattered My flock and driven them away, 

<p class="indent-2"> And ye have not visited them; 

<p class="indent-1"> I therefore will visit you 

<p class="indent-2"> For the wickedness of your doings. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I will gather My flock that is left 

<p class="indent-2"> From the countries to which I have driven them; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will bring them back to their homesteads, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they shall be fruitful and multiply. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I will raise up shepherds to tend to them: 

<p class="indent-2"> No fear or dismay or terror 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall they know any more, saith Jehovah. 

<h5>Promise of the Ideal King, or Messiah</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Behold, saith Jehovah, in the days that are coming 

<p class="indent-2"> I will raise up to David a righteous shoot, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who shall reign as King, and behave with wisdom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And execute justice and right in the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In his days shall Judah be crowned with salvation, 

<p class="indent-2"> And Israel in safety shall dwell; 

<p class="indent-1"> And this is the name men shall call him– 

<p class="indent-2"> "Our Champion is Jehovah." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore, behold, saith Jehovah, days are coming  when men shall no more say, "As surely as Jehovah  liveth who brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt,"  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  but "As surely as Jehovah liveth who brought the race  of the household of Israel from the north country and  from all the countries to which He had driven them";  and they shall dwell in their own land. 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Judgment on the Prophets</h4>

<h5>The Character and Fate of the False Prophets</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Concerning the prophets. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> My heart within me is broken, 

<p class="indent-2"> My bones are all grown soft; 

<p class="indent-1"> Like a drunken man am I, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a man overcome of wine, 

<p class="indent-1"> By reason of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> And of His glorious majesty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For the land is full of adulterers 

<p class="indent-2"> Who run an evil course, 

<p class="indent-2"> And whose might is not of right. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For prophet and priest are profane: 

<p class="indent-2"> Their wickedness I have witnessed 

<p class="indent-2"> In Mine own very house, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The way they must tread shall be therefore 

<p class="indent-2"> As slippery ground in the darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whereon they are thrust till they fall: 

<p class="indent-1"> For I will bring evil upon them– 

<p class="indent-2"> The year of their visitation. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In samaria’s prophets I witnessed 

<p class="indent-2"> Behaviour that was revolting; 

<p class="indent-1"> They prophesied by the Baal 

<p class="indent-2"> And seduced My people Israel. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But a horrible thing have I seen 

<p class="indent-2"> In the prophets of Jerusalem– 

<p class="indent-1"> Adultery, walking in falsehood, 

<p class="indent-2"> And strengthening the hands of the wicked, 

<p class="indent-2"> That no man doth turn from his wickedness. 

<p class="indent-1"> They are all of them grown like Sodom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And her citizens like Gomorrah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Thus therefore concerning the prophets 

<p class="indent-2"> Declareth Jehovah of Hosts: 

<p class="indent-1"> Behold! I will feed them with wormwood, 

<p class="indent-2"> And gall will I give them to drink; 

<p class="indent-1"> For from Jerusalem’s prophets there spreadeth 

<p class="indent-2"> Impiety over the land. 

<h5>The Promises are False, because the Prophets are not Divinely Inspired</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: 

<p class="indent-2"> Hearken not to the words of the prophets; 

<p class="indent-1"> They fill you with hopes that are vain. 

<p class="indent-2"> ’Tis their own heart’s vision they utter, 

<p class="indent-2"> And not what Jehovah hath spoken. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  They assure thos who mock at the word of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> That all with them shall be well. 

<p class="indent-1"> They assure those who follow their own stubborn hearts 

<p class="indent-2"> That no evil shall come upon them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But which of them ever hath stood and looked on 

<p class="indent-2"> In the council of Jehovah? 

<p class="indent-1"> Or which of them ever hath listened 

<p class="indent-2"> And heard any word of His? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I sent not the prophets, and yet they ran; 

<p class="indent-2"> Notwithstanding I spoke not to them, yet they prophesied. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But if ever they truly had stood in My council 

<p class="indent-2"> And heard any word that was Mine, 

<p class="indent-1"> My people they would have turned 

<p class="indent-2"> From their evil ways and behaviour. 

<h5>Inescapable Doom of the False Prophets</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Am I, saith Jehovah, a God that is nigh, 

<p class="indent-2"> And not a God afar? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Can any man hide, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> In secret, where I cannot see him? 

<p class="indent-2"> Do not I fill heaven and earth? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  I have heard what the prophets say, 

<p class="indent-2"> That prophesy lies in My name; 

<p class="indent-2"> "I have dreamed, I have dreamed, I have dreamed." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Will the heart of the prophets not turn 

<p class="indent-2"> That prophesy lies, and that prophesy 

<p class="indent-1"> Nought but their own heart’s delusions, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And think to drive My name 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Clean out of the minds of My people 

<p class="indent-2"> By the dreams that they tell one another, 

<p class="indent-1"> As erst by the Baal My name 

<p class="indent-2"> Was driven from the mind of their fathers? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  The prophet that hath a dream– 

<p class="indent-2"> Let him declare his dream: 

<p class="indent-1"> And he that hath My word– 

<p class="indent-2"> Let him faithfully utter My word. 

<p class="indent-1"> What hath straw, saith Jehovah, to do with the wheat? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Is not My word like a fire, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a hammer that shatters the rocks? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Mark this, therefore, saith Jehovah, I am against  the prophets that steal My words from one another.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  I am against the prophets who take their tongues  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and immediately reel off an oracle. I am against the  prophets that prophesy living dreams, seducing My  people by their lies and their windy boasts. They have  not been sent by Me, nor have they any commission  from Me, and to this people they bring no sort of gain  whatever. 

<h5>The "Burden" of the Lord No More</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When a layman or a prophet or a priest asketh thee  what is the burden of Jehovah, tell them, "You"  saith Jehovah, "are the burden, and I will cast you off.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  As for the prophet, the priest, or the layman, who  speaks any more of Jehovah’s ’burden,’, that man and  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  his household I will visit with judgment. You must  say to one another, ’What is Jehovah’s answer?’ or  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  ’What is Jehovah’s message?’ But you are not to  make mention to the burden of Jehovah any more.  Every man’s own (uninspired) word shall be his  burden; for you have perverted the words of the  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  living God, Jehovah of Hosts, our God. If, however,  you persist in speaking of ’the burden of Jehovah,’  Jehovah pronounces this word of doom: Because you  persist in using this expression ’burden of Jehovah,’  despite My explicit command to you not to use it,  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  I will lift you up and cast you out of My sight – you  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  and the city I gave to you and your fathers, and I  will lay upon you everlasting reproach and unending  disgrace which shall never be forgotten." 

<h4>The Baskets of Figs and their Meaning</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 24]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,  with the princes, the craftsmen and the smiths, had been  carried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar, king of  Babylon, into exile in Babylon, Jehovah in a vision  showed me two baskets of figs set down in front of  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jehovah’s Temple. One basket contained excellent  figs, like the figs that are first ripe: the figs in the other  were very bad, so bad that they could not be eaten." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Jehovah said to me, "What seest thou, Jere-  miah?" And I answered, "Figs – the good figs very  good, and the bad very bad, so bad that they cannot be  eaten." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thereupon this message came to me from Jehovah, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: As with these  good figs, so will I regard with favour the exiles of  Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  of the Chaldeans. I will set Mine eyes upon them for  good, and bring them back to this land. I will not pull  them down, but I will build them; I will not pluck them  up, but I will plant them; and I will give them a heart  to understand me, that I am Jehovah. They shall be  My people and I will be their God, if they turn to Me  with all their heart. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  As for the figs that were too bad to eat, Thus saith  Jehovah: They are symbolic of the fate of Zedekiah,  king of Judah, and his princes, and the survivors of  Jerusalem that are left in this land, and those whose  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  home is in the land of Egypt. For I will make them  an object of consternation among every kingdom in  the world, a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a  curse, in every place to which I shall drive them;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and I will send among them sword, famine and pesti-  lence, till they perish from the land that I gave to them  and their forefathers. 

<h4>The Divine Judgment to be Executed by the Babylonians</h4> upon Judah, upon the Neighbouring Nations, and upon the World at Large 

<h5>Prophetic Warning Disregarded by the People</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 25]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah concerning all  the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon – the mes-  sage he delivered to all the people of Judah and all  the citizens of Jerusalem: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For twenty-three years – from the thirteenth year  of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, up to this  day – the message of Jehovah has been coming to me,  and I have declared it to you early and late, but you  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  have not listened. And early and late Jehovah has  been sending to you all His servants the prophets,  through you have not listened nor inclined an attentive  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ear. My message was this: "If you abandon, every  man of you, your wicked ways and your evil behaviour,  then you shall dwell for ever in the land which Jehovah,  gave in the ancient time to you and your forefathers.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But do not indulge in the worship or service of other  gods, and do not provoke Jehovah with the fabri-  cations of your own hands: this can only injure your-  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  selves." But you have not listened to me. 

<h5>Judgment upon Judah and Her Neighbours</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Because  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  ye have not listened to My words, I will send and  fetch a clan from the north, and I will bring them  against this land and its inhabitants and against the  sorrounding nation. I will devote them to destruc-  tion so appalling that men shall hiss and revile them  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for ever; and I will banish form them the voice of mirth  and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, the  sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This whole land shall be a waste and a horror, and  these nations shall serve the king of Babylon for seventy  years. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When, however, seventy years are completed, I will punish  the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their  guilt, and also the land of the Chaldeans, which I will make  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  desolate for ever; and I will bring upon that land all the words  I have pronounced against it – everything prophesied by  Jeremiah against all the nations, that is recorded in this Book.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They, yes they, shall be reduced to slavery at the hands of  many nations and of great kings, and I will give them the reward  that their acts and deeds deserve. 

<h5>The Cup of Jehovah’s Fury to be Drunk by all Nations</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, to me,  "Take from My hand this wine-cup of wrath, and give  it to all the nations to whom I send thee to drink from;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and let them drink and reel in madness because of the  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  sword that I will send among them." So I took the  cup from the hand of Jehovah, and I gave it to all the  nations to whom Jehovah had sent me, to drink from–  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with her kings and  princes, to be made a desolation, a horror, a scorn,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and a curse; Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with his  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  ministers, his princes, and all his people, and all  the foreign folk; all the kings of the land of Uz, and  all the kings of the land of the Philistines – Ashkelon,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Gaza, Ekron, and the survivors of Ashdod; Edom,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Moab, and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and sidon;  and the kings of the coast-land across the sea;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Dedan and Tema and Buz, and all those that have the  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  corners of their hair clipped; all the kings of Northern  Arabia, and all the kings of the north, far and near,  one with another, and all the kingdoms on the face of  the earth; and after them shall the king of Sheshach  drink. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: Drink yourselves drunk till ye fall in  your vomit, to rise no more, because of the sword that I  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  shall send among you. If they refuse to take the cup from  thy hand to drink, then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Jehovah of Hosts: Drink it you shall; for, if the city  which is called by Mine own name is the first to feel the  weight of My displeasure, how can you expect to go  utterly unpunished? Nay, verily, ye shall not escape;  for I am summoning the sword upon all the inhabitants  of the earth, saith Jehovah of Hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  As for thee, let thy prophetic message to them be  this:  Jehovah will roar from on high, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> He will utter His voice from His holy abode; 

<p class="indent-1"> Against His own fold He will mightily roar, 

<p class="indent-2"> He will lift a "hurrah" like the men at the vintage 

<p class="indent-2"> Against those that dwell on the earth, every one. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then din shall reach to the end of the earth, 

<p class="indent-2"> For Jehovah doth hold a dispute with the nations; 

<p class="indent-1"> Yeah, He with all flesh will contend in judgment, 

<p class="indent-2"> And those that are base He will give to the sword. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: 

<p class="indent-2"> See! misery spreadeth from nation to nation; 

<p class="indent-1"> From the uttermost corners of earth 

<p class="indent-2"> There stirreth a mighty tempest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  That day the slain of Jehovah shall lie 

<p class="indent-2"> From one end of the earth to the other, 

<p class="indent-1"> Unmourned, ungathered, unburied, 

<p class="indent-2"> As dung on the face of the ground. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Howl, ye shepherds, and cry, 

<p class="indent-2"> And roll you in ashes, ye lords of the flock; 

<p class="indent-1"> For the days are ripe for your slaughter, 

<p class="indent-2"> Like lambs that are doomed shall ye fall. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  No escape shall be left for the shepherds, 

<p class="indent-2"> No flight for the lords of the flock; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  O hark to the cry of the shepherds, 

<p class="indent-2"> The howl of the lords of the flock; 

<p class="indent-2"> For Jehovah destroyeth their pasture. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  The meadows, so peaceful, are hushed 

<p class="indent-2"> At the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The lions have left their covert, 

<p class="indent-2"> For the land is become a desert, 

<p class="indent-1"> Because of the cruel sword, 

<p class="indent-2"> And because of His fierce hot anger. 

<h4>Jeremiah on Trial for his life</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 26]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of  Josiah, king of Judah, the message which follows came  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  (to Jeremiah) from Jehovah: Thus saith Jehovah,  Take thy stand in the Temple court, and declare with-  out reservation to all the people of Judah who are come  to worship in the Temple, the whole message that I  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  have commissioned thee to declare. It may be that  they will listen and severally abandon their wicked  ways: if they do, I will relent and not bring upon them  the calamity I am planning as penalty for their evil  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  behaviour. This, then, is what thou art to say to  them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye refuse to obey Me–  to live in accordance with the law that I have set before  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  you, and to listen, as ye have never yet listened, to the  words of My servants the prophets, whom early and  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  late I have been sending to you – then I will make this  Temple like Shiloh, and as for this city, I will turn it  into an object of execration to every nation in the world. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now the audience that listened to this message of  Jeremiah’s in the Temple included not only the whole  body of the people, but the priests and the prophets  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  as well. So when he had concluded the message which  Jehovah had commissioned him to declare to the whole  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  people, the priests and the prophets seized him. "You  must die," they exclaimed; "for how dare you  deliver in the name of Jehovah such a message as this,  that this Temple will meet the fate of Shiloh, and that  this city shall become an inhabited desolation?"  At this juncture all the people began to crowd round  Jeremiah in the Temple. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now echoes of this tumult having reached the ears  of the countries of Judah, they proceeded from the  palace up to the Temple; and after they had taken  their seats at the entrance to the new gate of the Temple,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  the priests and the prophets addressed themselves to  the countries and the whole body of the people. "This  man." they said, "is guilty of a capital offence; for  he has solemnly declared that this city is doomed–  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  you have heard him with your own ears. Then  Jeremiah in his turn addressed himself to the courtiers  and to the whole body of the people. "It is Jehovah  Himself," he said, "that has sent me to proclaim upon  this Temple and city the doom which you have just  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  heard. If, however, you amend your life and con-  duct, and listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, then  He will relent and cancel His threat of catastrophe.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As for myself, I am in your hands: deal with me as  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  you think right and proper. But be very sure of this,  that, if you put me to death, you will only be bringing  innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and  upon her people; for it is the simple truth that Jehovah  has sent me to deliver this message in your hearing."  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thereupon, the courtiers and all the people said to the  priests and the prophets, "This man is not guilty of  any capital offence; for his message to us has behind  it the authority of Jehovah our God." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Them some of the elders, rising to their feet, thus ad-  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  dressed the people assembled: "In the days of Hezekiah,  king of Judah," they said, "Micah of Moresheth was  prophesying; and this is what he said to all the people  of Judah:  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:  Like a field shall Zion be ploughed, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> And Jerusalem levelled to ruins; 

<p class="indent-1"> And the Temple Mount shall become 

<p class="indent-2"> Like a thickly wooded height. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Did Hezekiah the king or the people of Judah dream  of putting him to death? Rather were they not so over-  come by godly fear that they sued for the favour of  Jehovah, with the result that He relented and cancelled  His threat of catastrophe? But look at us! Why, we are  on the verge of involving ourselves in a great calamity." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Jeremiah, however, had (also) the support of Ahikam,  the son of Shaphan, who saved him from being delivered  to the people for execution. 

<h5>The Fate of Urijah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  There was another case of a man who delivered  prophetic messages in the name of Jehovah – Uriah,  the son of Shemaiah, who belonged to Kiriath-jearim.  Quite in the manner of Jeremiah, he too had pronounced  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  the doom of this city and land. His message having  reached the ears of King Jehoiakim, with all the court  and the military officials, the king took steps to have  him put to death. Urijah, however, got wind of his  purpose, and in terror he took to flight, finally reaching  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Egypt; but King Jehoiakim despatched commis-  sioners to Egypt – Elnathan the son of Achbor, and a few  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  others – who removed him from Egypt and brought  him back to the presence of King Jehoiakim, who  had him slain with the sword, and his dead body flung  into the public burying-ground. 

<h5>No Hope of Speedy Release from Babylon</h5>

<h4>The Babylonian Yoke will not be soon or easily Broken</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 27]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the son  of Josiah, king of Judah, Jeremiah received from  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jehovah the message which follows. Thus spoke  Jehovah: Make thongs and bars and put them on  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  thy neck, and send a message to the kings of Edom,  Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon, through their am-  bassadors who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  king of Judah, and bid them say to their masters,  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Convey this message to your masters. I have made  the earth, with man and beast on the face of it,  by My great power and outstretched arm, and I give it  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  to whomsoever I please. At the moment I have given  all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king  of Babylon, My servant; the beasts of the field also  have I given him to serve him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson,  till the time of his own land shall come – then many nations  and great kings shall make him serve. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The nation and the kingdom which refuses to serve  Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and to put their  necks to the yoke of the king of Babylon – that nation,  saith Jehovah, I will punish with sword, famine and  pestilence, till I have delivered them into his hands. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As for yourselves, do not listen to your prophets,  diviners, dreamers, soothsayers, or sorcerers, who  assure you that you will not be subject to the king of  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Babylon. It is a lie that they preach to you, and it  will end in your removal from your own land; for I  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  will indeed drive you away and ye shall perish. But  the nation that brings its neck to the yoke of the king of  Babylon and serves him, I will leave on their own soil,  which they shall continue to till and occupy." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  A similar message I gave to zedekiah, king of Judah,  "If,’ said I, "you bring your neck to the yoke of the  king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, you will  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  be spared. Why should you and your people die by the  sword, famine and pestilence, with which Jehovah has  threatened the nation that refuses to serve the king of  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Babylon? Do not listen to the prophets when they tell  you that you will not be subject to the king of Babylon:  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  they are preaching to you a lie. I have not sent them,  saith Jehovah: it is a lie that they are preaching to you  in My name, and it can only end in your being driven  out and perishing – you and the prophets that preach  to you." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And the message that I gave to the priests and to all  this people was this: "Thus saith Jehovah: Do not  listen to the prophets when they tell you that the vessels  of the Temple will soon be brought back from Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  They are preaching to you a lie: do not listen to them.  Serve the king of Babylon and you will be spared:  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  why should this city become a ruin? But if they are  real prophets with a real message from Jehovah, let  them entreat Jehovah of Hosts not to allow the vessels  that are left in the Temple and in the royal palace at  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jerusalem, to be taken to Babylon. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars and the sea  and the stands and the rest of the vessels that are left  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  in this city, which were not taken by Nebuchadnezzar,  king of Babylon, when he carried Jeconiah, the son of  Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the nobles of Judah  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and Jerusalem, from Jerusalem to Babylon. Yes,  thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, con-  cerning the vessels that are left in the Temple and in  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  the royal palace and at Jerusalem; To Babylon  they shall be brought, and there they shall remain till  the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then I will  bring them up and restore them to this place." 

<h4>The Clash between the False Prophet and the True</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 28]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The same year, at the beginning of the reign of  Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth  year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who  belonged to Gibeon, addressed me as follows in the  Temple in the presence of the priests and of all the  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  people. "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of  Israel: ’I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Within two years’ time I will bring back to this place all  the Temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, king of  Babylon took from this place and carried to Babylon;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and  all the exiles of Judah that have gone to Babylon, I  will bring back to this place, saith Jehovah; for I will  break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’" 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to Hananiah the  prophet in the presence of the priests and of all the  people that were standing in the Temple; and Jeremiah  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  the prophet said, "Amen! Jehovah do so! May  Johevah fulfil your prophecy and bring back the Temple  vessels and all the exiles from Babylon to this place!  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I ask you, however to listen to this word that I am  about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  the people. From the beginning the prophets who pre-  ceded you and me in their messages concerning many  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  lands and mighty kingdoms, prophesied war. If a  prophet prophesies peace, it is only when his word has  been fulfilled that you can be sure that he has had a real  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  commission from Jehovah." Then Hananiah took the  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  bar off Jeremiah’s neck, broke it, and declared in the  presence of all the people, "Thus saith Jehovah:  ’Within two years’ time, I will similarly break the  yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, off the  necks of all the nations.’" Then Jeremiah the prophet  went away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But after Hananiah had broken the bar off Jeremiah’s  neck, there came to Jeremiah this message from  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jehovah: "Go and say to Hananiah, Thus saith  Jehovah, The wooden bar you have indeed broken,but  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I will replace it with a bar of iron. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The yoke that I  will put on the necks of all these nations will be made  of iron – a yoke of service to Nebuchadnezzar, king of  Babylon: for serve him they shall. I have also given  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  him the beasts of the field." Then Jeremiah said to  Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah. You have no com-  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  mission from Jehovah: you are making this people  trust a lie. Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ’Mark this  well: I will dismiss thee from the face of the earth.  This very year thou shalt die; for thy words are a  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  disloyalty to Jehovah.’" And that very year, in the  seventh month, the prophet Hananaiah died. 

<h4>Jeremiah Exhorts the Exiles to settle down in Babylon</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 29]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The following is a copy of the letter sent from  Jerusalem by Jeremiah the prophet to the elders, the  priests, the prophets, and all the people, who had been  carried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to exile in  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Babylon – after the surrender of Jeconiah the king,  and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes  of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and smiths–  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  the letter being sent by the hands of Eleasah the son of  Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, who had  been despatched to Babylon to Nebuchanezzar, king of  Babylon, by Zedekiah, king of Judah: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, to  all the exiles whom I have carried from Jerusalem to  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Babylon: Build houses and settle; plant gardens  and eat the fruit of them; take wives and rear families;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  take wives also for your sons and give your daughters  to husbands, that they may have sons and daughters;  increase your numbers and do not let them diminish.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And strive for the welfare of the country to which I  have brought you as exiles. Pray for it to Jehovah;  for your own welfare and hers are bound up together.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Do not let yourselves be beguiled by the prophets and  diviners in your midst, and do not listen to the dreams  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  they dream; for it is a lie that they preach to you in  My name – they have no commission from Me, saith  Jehovah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah: As soon as Babylon’s  seventy years are accomplished, I will visit you and  bring you back to this place, in fulfilment of the garcious  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  promise I made you. For I know the thoughts I cherish  towards you – thoughts of weal and not of woe – to  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  bestow upon you a future and a hope. When you  call, I will answer you, and I will listen to your  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  prayer. If ye seek Me ye shall find Me. If ye seek  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Me with all your heart, I will reveal Myself to you,  saith Jehovah; and I will restore your fortunes and gather you  from all the nations and places to which I have driven you,  saith Jehovah, and I will bring you back to the place from  which I carried you into exile. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah concerning the king who sits on  the throne of David, and concerning all the people whose home  is in this city – those brethren of yours who have not had to  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  accompany you into exile. Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: See! I  will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence among them,  and I will make them like figs that are too horribly bad to eat.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I will hunt them with sword, famine, and pestilence and I will  make them an object of consternation to every kingdom in the  world, and object of execration and horror, of scorn and insult  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  among all the nations to which I have driven them; because,  saith Jehovah, they refused to listen to the messages I sent them  early and late through My servants the prophets – yes, they  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  refused to listen, saith Jehovah. See, then, that ye listen to  Jehovah’s message, all of you exiles whom I have sent from  Jerusalem to Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But Jehovah, you say, has raised up for you prophets  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  in Babylon. Well, thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the  God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and  Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who preach to you a lie  in My name. Mark this: I will deliver them into the  hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and he  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  will slay them before your eyes; and their fate shall be  adopted by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon as a  model for imprecation. "Jehovah make thee," they  will say, "like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Babylon roasted in the fire," because they wrought  impious folly in Israel, in committing adultery with  their neighbours’ wives and delivering in My name  lying messages which I never gave them. Well I  know it, saith Jehovah, and I am witness." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Touching the message of Jehovah of Hosts, the  God of Israel, to be delivered by Jeremiah concerning  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Shemaiah of Nehelam. This is the man who sent a  letter in his own name to Zephaniah, the son of  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Maaseiah the priest. "Jehovah," he wrote, "has  made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,  to exercise an oversight in the Temple over all that play  the mad prophet and the ecstatic, and to put all such  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  in the stocks and in the iron collar. Why then did you  not rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth, who has been playing  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  the mad prophet among you? For he has sent a  message to us in Babylon, maintaining that the exile  would be long, and urging us to build houses and settle,  and to plant gardens and eat the fruit of them."  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Now Zephaniah the priest read the letter in the hearing  of Jeremiah the prophet. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then there came to Jeremiah this message from  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Jehovah: Send to all the exiles and say, Thus saith  Jehovah concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Shemaiah  has been prophesying to you without any commission  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  from Me and has made you trust in a lie. For this  reason, therefore– thus saith Jehovah – I will punish  Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants: not a  man shall he have among you who will ever see the good  fortune I will bring you, saith Jehovah: for his words  are a disloyalty to Jehovah. 

<h5>The Glorious Future</h5>

<h4>The Restoration of Israel and Judah</h4>

<h5>Promise of Deliverance in the Day of Distress</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 30]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Write all the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  words I have spoken to thee in a book. For mark!  the days are coming, saith Jehovah, when I will restore  the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah, and re-  establish them in possession of the land I gave their  forefathers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Now these are the words Jehovah hath spoken  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  concerning Israel and Judah. Yea, thus saith Jehovah: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> We have heard a cry of terror, 

<p class="indent-2"> Of horror and dispeace. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Ask ye now and see 

<p class="indent-2"> If a man doth travail with child. 

<p class="indent-1"> What meaneth them this sight– 

<p class="indent-2"> Every man with his hands on his loins? 

<p class="indent-1"> And what mean all these faces 

<p class="indent-2"> Turned to a deathly pallor? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Alas! for great is this day, 

<p class="indent-2"> No day is like unto it; 

<p class="indent-1"> A time of distress for Jacob– 

<p class="indent-2"> Yet out of it he shall be saved. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  On that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will break the yoke from their necks; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will snap their bonds asunder, 

<p class="indent-2"> And strangers no more shall they serve. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Jehovah their God they shall serve. 

<p class="indent-2"> And David also, their king, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whom I will raise up unto them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, 

<p class="indent-2"> O Israel, be not dismayed, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> For see! I will save both thee and thine offspring 

<p class="indent-2"> From the far distant land where captive ye lie. 

<p class="indent-1"> And Jacob once more shall have quite and ease 

<p class="indent-2"> In his own land, with no one make him afraid; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For I, saith Jehovah, am with thee to save thee. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> An end I will make of the nations– 

<p class="indent-2"> Of each, among whom I have scattered thee; 

<p class="indent-1"> But of thee I will not make an end. 

<p class="indent-2"> I will not leave thee wholly unpunished, 

<p class="indent-2"> But in measure I will chastise thee. 

<h5>Promise of Healing</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-2"> Thou art wounded past all healing, 

<p class="indent-2"> And smitten very sore. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There is no one to plead thy cause; 

<p class="indent-2"> No healing for thy wound, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thy scars remain unclosed. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Thy lovers have all forgotten thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> They care for thee no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> I have struck thee as foemen strike, 

<p class="indent-2"> With chastisement unpitying, 

<p class="indent-1"> Because of thy manifold guilt 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy sins` that are grown so mighty. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Why criest thou over thy wound, 

<p class="indent-2"> That thy pain is past all healing? 

<p class="indent-1"> ’Tis because of thy manifold guilt 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy sins that are grown so mighty, 

<p class="indent-2"> I have done these things unto thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Devoured shall be therefore all those that devour thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> Thine enemies all shall go into captivity; 

<p class="indent-1"> Those that despoil thee themselves shall be spoiled, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thy plunders I will consign to be plundered. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I will cause new flesh to grow over thy wound, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will heal thy scars, saith Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> For men have called thee an outcast, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Our quarry" – for whom none careth. 

<h5>The Happy City, with her Native Prince</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> The tents that were Jacob’s I yet will restore, 

<p class="indent-2"> On the sites that were his I will show My compassion; 

<p class="indent-1"> On her own proper mound shall the city be built, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the place shall stand on its rightful site. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And out of them songs of praise shall float, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the voices of them that make merry; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will add to their numbers till many they be, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will crown them with glory, and they shall be honoured. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Their children shall be as in days of old, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their sacred assembly safe under My care; 

<p class="indent-2"> I will punish all those that oppress them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Their prince shall be one of themselves, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their ruler shall come from among them. 

<p class="indent-1"> I will let him draw nigh and approach Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> For where is the man, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> That else had the courage to face Me? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And ye shall be My people, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I will be your God. 

<h5>Judgment shall Break upon the Wicked</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Hark! ’tis Jehovah’s tempest, 

<p class="indent-1"> It goeth forth with fury– 

<p class="indent-1"> A whirling temptest that whirleth 

<p class="indent-2"> Full straight for the heads of the wicked. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The glowing wrath of Jehovah 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall not be backward turned, 

<p class="indent-1"> Until He have fully accomplished 

<p class="indent-2"> The purpose of His heart. 

<p class="indent-2"> At the end of the days ye shall know what this meaneth. 

<h5>Israel’s Happy Return form Exile</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 31]</p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At that time, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will be God indeed 

<p class="indent-1"> Unto all the families of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they shall be My people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> The people escaped from the sword 

<p class="indent-2"> shall most surely find grace in the wilderness. 

<p class="indent-1"> When Israel seeketh for rest, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  From afar will Jehovah appear to him. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> I have loved thee with love everlasting. 

<p class="indent-2"> And so I with kindness have drawn thee. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Once more, O virgin of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will build thee up securely: 

<p class="indent-1"> Once more shalt thou deck thee with timbrels, 

<p class="indent-2"> And step in the merry dance; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Once more on the hills of Samaria 

<p class="indent-2"> Shall vineyards be planted by thee, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the planters shall eat what they planted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For a day shall come when the watchers 

<p class="indent-2"> On Ephraim’s highlands shall cry, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Arise, let us pilgrim to Zion, 

<p class="indent-2"> Where dwelleth Jehovah our God." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah to Jacob, 

<p class="indent-2"> Ring out a cry of joy; 

<p class="indent-1"> Shout on the top of the mountains, 

<p class="indent-2"> Publish, and praise, and say, 

<p class="indent-1"> "Jehovah hath saved His people, 

<p class="indent-2"> The remnant of Israel." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Behold, from the north land I bring them, 

<p class="indent-2"> And out of earth’s uttermost parts I will gather them– 

<p class="indent-1"> Among them the blind and the lame, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the women with child, with those soon to be mothers; 

<p class="indent-2"> Hither again they shall come – a great company. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Forth they went with tears, 

<p class="indent-2"> But their homeward way I will comfort; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will lead them to streams of water, 

<p class="indent-2"> On a level way without stumbling; 

<p class="indent-1"> For I am a Father to Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> And Ephraim is My first-born. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Hear, O ye nations, the word of Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Declare it to far distant islands and say, 

<p class="indent-1"> "He that scattered Israel shall gather him, 

<p class="indent-2"> And keep him as shepherd his flock." 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, 

<p class="indent-2"> And redeemed him from hands that were stronger than his. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They shall come, they shall sing on the heights of Zion, 

<p class="indent-2"> All radiant with joy at the gifts of Jehovah– 

<p class="indent-1"> The corn and the wine and the oil, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the young of the flock and the herd; 

<p class="indent-1"> Their soul like a well-watered garden shall be, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they shall pine no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then the maids shall rejoice in the dance, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the young and the old shall be merry; 

<p class="indent-1"> I will turn their mourning to joy, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will comfort and gladden them after their sorrow. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The priests I will satisfy richly, 

<p class="indent-2"> My folk shall be filled with My bounty. 

<h5>Mother Rachel’s Sorrow for her Exiled Children</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Hark! there echoes through Ramah, 

<p class="indent-2"> Lament and bitter weeping: 

<p class="indent-1"> ’Tis Rachel bewailing her children,

<p class="indent-2"> Because they are no more. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: 

<p class="indent-1"> Restrain thy voice from weeping, 

<p class="indent-2"> And keep thine eyes from tears;

<p class="indent-2"> From the land of the foe shall thy children return. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  There is hope for thy coming days,

<h5>Israel’s Penitence, Return and Welcome Home</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Truly I heard the voice 

<p class="indent-2"> Of Ephraim thus lamenting, 

<p class="indent-1"> "Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened;

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Is not Ephraim my dear, dear son? 

<p class="indent-2"> Is he not a darling child? 

<p class="indent-1"> For let Me but utter his name, 

<p class="indent-2"> And My mind keeps resting upon him. 

<p class="indent-1"> So My heart for him doth yearn, 

<p class="indent-2"> And pity him I must. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Set way-marks, and make thee guide-posts; 

<p class="indent-1"> Bethink thee of the highway,;

<h5>The Restoration of Judah</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:

<p class="indent-2"> And the shepherds that wander with flocks. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For the weary soul I refresh, 

<p class="indent-2"> And each soul that doth pine I replenish. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Thereupon I awoke and gazed, 

<p class="indent-2"> For my sleep had been sweet unto me. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Behold, saith Jehovah, the days are coming, 

<p class="indent-2"> When I will sow the households of Israel and Judah 

<p class="indent-2"> With the seed of men and the seed of cattle. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And as once I was awakeful to pluck them up, 

<p class="indent-2"> To break down, to afflict, overthrow and destroy them, 

<p class="indent-1"> So now I will watch over them (once more, 

<p class="indent-2"> But this time) to build up and to plant, saith Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  In those days men shall say no more, 

<p class="indent-1"> "The fathers have eaten sour grapes,

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But each for his own sin shall die.

<h4>The New Covenant</h4>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Behold the days are coming, 

<p class="indent-2"> When I, saith Jehovah, will make a new covenant 

<p class="indent-2"> With the households of Israel and Judah–

<p class="indent-2"> The day, when I took their hand in Mine, 

<p class="indent-2"> To bring them out of the land of Egypt– 

<p class="indent-1"> The covenant they themselves did break, 

<p class="indent-2"> So that I, on My part, was constrained to abhor them. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But this, saith Jehovah, is the covenant I will make 

<p class="indent-2"> With the household of Israel after those days: 

<p class="indent-1"> I will set My law in their bosom, 

<p class="indent-2"> And write it upon their heart, 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will be their God, 

<p class="indent-3"> And they shall be My people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  No more need any teach 

<p class="indent-2"> His fellow to know Jehovah; 

<p class="indent-1"> For one and all shall know Me, 

<p class="indent-2"> The small and the great alike; 

<p class="indent-1"> For I will pardon their guilt, 

<p class="indent-2"> And their sin will remember no more. 

<h5>Perpetuity of Israel</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Thus declareth Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who giveth the sun for a light by day, 

<p class="indent-2"> The moon and the stars for a light by night, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who stirreth the sea that the waves thereof roar– 

<p class="indent-2"> Jehovah of Hosts is His name: 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Not until those fixed orbs shall vanish 

<p class="indent-2"> Clean out of My sight, saith Jehovah, 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall Israel’s race cease to be 

<p class="indent-2"> A nation before Me for ever. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Not till the heavens above can be measured, 

<p class="indent-2"> And earth’s foundations be searched out beneath, 

<p class="indent-1"> Shall I ever cast off the race of Israel 

<p class="indent-2"> For all they have done, saith Jehovah. 

<h5>Expansion of Jerusalem’s Ancient Boundary</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Be assured, saith Jehovah, the days are coming, when  the city shall again be built up for Jehovah from the 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  tower of Hananel to the gate at the corner, and the  line of the wall shall pass straight on to the hill Gareb, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  where it will turn round to Goah. Further, the entire  valley (of Hinnom) with its corpses and ashes and  the whole locality as far as the valley of Kidron up  to the corner of the horse-gate on the east, shall be  consecrated to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up or  thrown down again for ever. 

<h4>During the Siege Jeremiah Displays his Confidence in the Ulimate</h4> Restoration of his People by Redeeming a Piece of Land Belonging to his  Family at Anathoth 

<h5>The Purchase</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 32]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah  in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  was in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At that  time the forces of the king of Babylon were investing  Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined to  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  the guard-house of the royal palace, where Zedekiah the  king had shut him up on account of his prophetic  preaching. "What do you mean," he had demanded,  "by an announcement of this kind: ’Thus saith  Jehovah, Depend upon it, I will give this city into the  hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Nor shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape the hands of  the Chaldeans; he will assuredly be delivered into the  hands of the king of Babylon. He shall speak to him  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  face to face, and see him eye to eye; and he shall bring  Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain till I visit  him. Though you fight with the Chaldeans you shall  have no success.’" 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now there came to Jeremiah the following message  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  from Jehovah: "Hanamel, the son of thine uncle  Shallum, is about to pay thee a visit, to request thee to  buy the land he holds at Anathoth; and he will urge  that, as thou art the next of kin, it is thy privilege and  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  duty to receive it." And so it happened: my cousin  Hanamel paid me in the guard-house the visit Jehovah  had intimated, and said: "I want you to buy the land  I possess at Anathoth; for you are the legal heir, and  it is your duty to secure it – so buy it for yourself."  Then I recognised that the message I had received was  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  really from Jehovah. So I bought the land at Anathoth  from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the money  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  to him – seventeen silver shekels. Then I signed the  deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and paid him the  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  money in full. I then took the purchase-deed–  the one which was sealed and the one which was open–  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of  Machesiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, and  of the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deed  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and of all the Jews in the guard-house. In their  presence I then gave these instructions to Baruch:  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Take these deeds – this purchase deed which is sealed  and this deed which is open – and put them in an  earthenware jar, so that they may be preserved for a  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  long time to come. For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: A time is coming when houses and  fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land." 

<h5>The Prophet’s Prayer</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Now, after I had given the purchase-deed to Baruch,  the son of Neriah, I prayed in these words to Jehovah:  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  "Ah, Lord Jehovah! Thou, by Thy mighty power and  outstretched arm, hast made the heavens and the earth,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and nothing is too hard for Thee. Kindness Thou  showest to thousands, and retribution for the guilt of  the fathers thou bringest home to their children after  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  them, Thou great and mighty God, great in purpose and  mighty in action, whose eyes are open to all the ways of  men, giving to each his deserts and the fruit of his deeds.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  In the land of Egypt Thou didst set in Israel and  among (other) men signs and wonders (which are  commemorated) unto this day, and so didst win for  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Thyself the renown that is Thine to-day; and Thou  didst bring Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt  by signs and wonders, with mighty hand out-  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  stretched arm and terrors great; and Thou gavest them  this land which Thou didst swear to their fathers to  give them – a land flowing with milk and honey – and  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  they came in and took possession of it. But they would  not listen to Thy voice, nor live in accordance with Thy  law; they have left undone all that Thou didst com-  mand them to do; and so Thou hast brought all this  misery upon them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Behold how the siege-mounds for storming the city  are already close upon it, and under the stress of  sword, famine and pestilence, the city is already as good  as given into the hands of the Chaldeans that are assail-  ing it. What Thou hast threatened has come, as  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Thou Thyself seest. And it was Thou Thyself, O  Lord Jehovah, who didst command me to buy the land;  (and this I have done), writing and sealing the deed  and calling witnesses, though all the while the city is  already as good as delivered into the hands of the  Chaldeans." 

<h5>The Divine Answer: First, Judgment for Sin</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then there came to Jeremiah the following message  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  from Jehovah: I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  there anything too hard for Me? Therefore thus saith  Jehovah: Behold! I am about to deliver this city into  the hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadrezzar,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  king of Babylon, and he shall take it. Yes, the  Chaldeans that are assailing this city shall come and set  this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose  roofs they have provoked Me by burning sacrifice to  the Baal and by offering drink-offerings to other  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  gods; for, ever since their youth the people of Israel  and Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  From the day it was built up to this day, this city has  provoked Me to remove it, in wrath and fury, out of  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  My sight, for all the evil that the people of Israel and  Judah have wrought to vex Me – themselves, with their  kings, princes, priests and prophets, with the men of  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. They have  turned their backs to Me instead of their faces; and  though I taught them early and late, they would never  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  listen or accept correction. The very House that  bears My name they have defiled by introducing  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  into it their abominable worship. They have built  Baal sanctuaries in the Valley of the son of Hinnom  for the (fiery) consecration of their sons and daughters  to Molech, though this was no commandment of  Mine – it never entered into My mind that they should  do this abomination, and thus involve Judah in sin. 

<h5>Thereafter, Promise of Restoration</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Now, therefore, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel,  concerning the city of which ye say that hunger,  famine and pestilence have already as good as delivered  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  it into the hands of the king of Babylon: See! I will  gather them out of all the lands to which, in My great  wrath, anger, and fury, I have driven them, for I will  bring them back to this place and settle them here  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  securely; and they shall be My people, and I will be  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  their God. A single heart I will give them, and a single  way (will I set before them), that they may hold Me  in reverence for ever, and that they and their children  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  after them may prosper; and I will make with them  an everlasting covenant to follow them ceaselessly  with My blessing, and I will put the fear of Me in their  hearts, that they may follow Me without swerving.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  It will also be a joy to Me to do them good; and  faithfully, with all My heart and soul, I will plant them in  this land. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah, As surely as I have brought  upon this people all this mass of misery, so surely will I  bring upon them all the blessings I promise them.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  In this land that ye call a desolation, forsaken of man  and beast and delivered into the hands of the Chal-  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  deans, fields shall be bought once more. Yes, men  shall buy fields for money, subscribing and sealing the  deeds, and taking witnesses, in the district of Benjamin  and the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and the cities of  Judah, in the cities of the hill country, the lowland,  and the south. For I will restore their fortunes, saith  Jehovah. 

<h4>Renewed Promises of Restoration</h4>

<h5>Jerusalem and Judah will be Pardoned, Restored, Made Glad and Renowned</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 33]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A second message from Jehovah came to Jeremiah  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  while he was still confined in the guard-house. It  was this: Thus saith Jehovah, who created the earth  and formed it to stand fast – Jehovah is His name: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  "Call to Me, and in answer I will tell thee great and  hidden things, of which thou art unaware." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning  the houses of this city and the royal palaces of Judah  which have been demolished to make a defence against  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  the siege-mounds and the sword. The Chaldeans are  coming to fight and to fill them with the dead bodies  of the men whom I have slain in Mine anger and fury,  and whose manifold wickedness has constrained Me  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  to hide My face from them. Nevertheless, I will close  up the city’s wounds and heal her completely, and I  will unveil to them treasures of peace and stability.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The fortunes of Judah and Israel I will restore; and I  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  will build them up as of old. I will cleanse them of all  the guilt of their sin against Me, and I will forgive all  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  the guilt of their sin and rebellion against Me. And  she shall be to Me a source of delight, of praise, and of  glory among all the nations of the earth, when they hear  of all the happiness that I shall achieve for them; and  they shall fear and tremble at all the happiness and all  the prosperity that I shall provide for them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: In this place that you call a  desolation, forsaken of man and beast, in the cities of  Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  forsaken of man and beast, there shall once again be  heard the voice of mirth and gladness, the voice of  bridegroom and bride, the voice of those that say, as they  bring their thank-offerings into the House of Jehovah, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Give thanks to Jehovah of Hosts, 

<p class="indent-2"> For Jehovah is gracious, 

<p class="indent-2"> His kindness endureth for ever.  For I will restore the fortunes of the land, saith  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Jehovah, as in the olden time. Thus saith Jehovah of  Hosts: In this place which is desolate, forsaken of  man and beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shall  again be homesteads of shepherds with flocks reclining.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In the cities of the hill country, the lowland, and the  south, in the district of Benjamin, the neighbourhood of  Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, flocks shall once  more file past, to be counted under the hands (of the  shepherds), saith Jehovah. 

<h5>Promise of the Ideal King or Messiah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Mark this, saith Jehovah; the days are coming when I will  perform My gracious promise to the households of Israel and  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Judah. In those days and at that time  I will raise up for David a righteous shoot, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Who shall execute justice and right in the land. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In those days shall Judah be crowned with salvation, 

<p class="indent-2"> And Jerusalem in safety shall dwell: 

<p class="indent-1"> And this is the name men shall call her, 

<p class="indent-2"> "Our champion is Jehovah." 

<h5>Promise of the Perpetuity of the Davidic Dynasty and the Levitical Priesthood</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  upon the throne of the house of Israel; neither shall the  Levitical priests ever, for all time to come, want a man to  offer burnt-offerings in My presence or to burn oblations or to  do sacrifice. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Further, there came to Jeremiah this message from Jehovah,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: Not until ye can annul My covenant with  Day and Night, so that Day and Night shall come no more at  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  their appointed time – not until then shall My covenant be  annulled with David My servant, that a son od his should reign  upon his throne; or My covenant with the Levitical priests,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  My ministers. Numberless as the host of heaven, measureless  as the sand of the sea, shall I multiply the descendants of  David, My servant, and the Levitical priests, My ministers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Jeremiah received this further message from Jehovah: Hast  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  thou observed what this people has been saying? They have  said that Jehovah has cast off the two families of His choice,  and in contempt for His people has ordained that they shall no  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  longer exist as a nation before Him? Well, thus saith  Jehovah: As surely as I have created Day and Night and  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  determined the order of heaven and earth, so surely will I never  cast off the descendants of Jacob and of David My servant,  or fail to select his descendants as rulers over the race of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; for I will have compassion upon  them and restore their fortunes. 

<h4>Incidents of the Siege of Jerusalem</h4>

<h5>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah of the Folly of Resisting Babylon</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 34]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  This message came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when  Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army,  and all the kingdoms and nations of the earth that  were under his dominion were fighting against  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah: Thus saith  Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go to Zedekiah, king of  Judah, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: I am  about to deliver this city into the hands of the king of  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Babylon, who will burn it with fire. As for thee, thou  shalt not escape out of his hands: thou wilt assuredly  be seized and into his hands delivered: thou shalt see  the king of Babylon eye to eye, and speak to him face  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  to face, and to Babylon thou shalt go. But listen,  Zedekiah, king of Judah, to the message of Jehovah:  Thus saith Jehovah concerning thee: Thou shalt not  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  die by the sword, but thou shalt die in peace. (Sweet  spices) shall be burned for thee, as for thine ancerstors  before thee, and lamentations shall be made for thee  with "Ah! Lord," for I, saith Jehovah, have spoken  the word. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then Jeremiah the prophet delivered this message to  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, when the army  of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem,  and all the cities of Judah that were left, and Lachish  and Azekah – the only cities of Judah that remained as  fortified cities. 

<h5>Dishonest Attitude of the Jews to the Liberation of their</h5> Slaves: To be Punished by the Liberation of Disaster upon Themselves 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,  after the King Zedekiah had covenanted with all the people  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty – each  man to set free his Hebrew slave, wether male or  female, so that no one of Jewish descent should serve  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  as slave any longer. Now all the princes and all the  people kept the covenant they had entered into to  liberate their several male and female slaves and to  treat them as slaves no longer: they kept it and set  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  them free. Afterwards, however, they turned and  forced back into slavery the male and female slaves  whom they had liberated. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then there came to Jeremiah this message from  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel:  When I brought your forefathers out of the land of  Egypt, that house of slavery, I Myself made this  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  covenant that at the end of six years they were to  release any Hebrew brother who had sold himself to  them-after six years of service, they were to set him  free: your forefathers, however, would not listen  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  or incline their ear to Me. But you have in these days  acted in a very different spirit; you have done what  I desired in each proclaiming liberty to his (enslaved)  neighbour; in My presence you made a covenant  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  in the House that is called by My name. Now,  however, you have turned round and dishonoured My  name by forcing back again into slavery the several  male and female slaves you had set free to dispose of  themselves as they would. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah: You have disobeyed  My injunction to make a proclamation of liberty, each of  you to his (enslaved) neighbour. Well, then, saith  Jehovah: You shall have your proclamation of liberty  from Me – (liberty) to the sword, pestilence and  famine – and I will make you an object of consternation  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  to every kingdom in the world. As for the men  that broke the covenant they had made in My presence,  when they passed between the pieces of the calf they  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  had cut in two – I mean the princes of Judah and  Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests and all the people of  the land who passed between the pieces of the calf  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  they had cut in two – I will deliver them into the hands  of their enemies and of those that seek their life, and  their dead bodies shall be devoured by the birds of the  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  air and the beasts of the earth. Further, Zedekiah,  king of Judah, and his princes, I will deliver into the  hands of their enemies and of those that seek their life,  and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon  which (for the moment) has raised the siege and left you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Mark this well, saith Jehovah, I will issue My word of  command and bring them back to this city; they  shall assault it and take it and burn it with fire, and the  cities of Judah I will turn into an uninhabited desolation. 

<h4>The Fidelity of the Rechabites contrasted with the Disobedience of the Jews</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 35]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of  Judah, Jeremiah received the following message from  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jehovah: Go to the clan of the Rechabites, talk with  them, bring them into one of the chambers (of the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Temple) and offer them wine to drink. So I took  Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaz-  ziniah, with his brothers and all his sons and the whole  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Rechabite clan, and brought them into the Temple  chamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, the son of  Yigdaliah, the man of God, that was adjacent to the  chamber of the princes, above the chamber of  Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the Keeper of the  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Threshold. I then set before the Rechabites bowls  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  full of wine and cups and told them to drink. "No,"  they said, "we will drink no wine; for Jonadab, the  son of Rechab, our ancestor, laid a charge upon us and  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  our children to drink no wine, to build no houses, to sow  no seed, to plant and possess no vineyard for ever, but to  spend all our days in tents, so that we might live long on  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  the land where as strangers we dwell. In full obedience,  therefore, to this charge of Jonadab, the son of Rechab,  our ancestor, we have drunk no wine all our life long,  neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  daughters. We have built no houses to live in, we  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  have owned neither vineyard, field, nor seed, but  we have lived in tents and faithfully fulfilled all the  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  instructions of our ancestors Jonadab. It was only  when the land was invaded by Nebuchadrezzar, king  of Babylon, that we decided to come to Jerusalem, to  escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies; that is  why we are (now) living in Jerusalem." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then there came to Jeremiah this message from  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jehovah: "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel:  Go and say to the men of Judah and the citizens of  Jerusalem: Should this not be a lesson to you to obey  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  My words, saith Jehovah? The injunction that  Jonadab the son of Rechab laid upon his sons to  drink no wine has been steadily observed: in obedience  to that ancestral charge they have abstained to this day.  But when I spoke to you early and late, you refused  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  to listen. Early and late I sent you all My servants the  prophets with the message to each man of you that, if  you would abandon your wicked ways, amend your  conduct, and no longer indulge in the service of other  gods, you should continue in the land that I gave your  forefathers; but you would not incline your ear or  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  listen to Me. Unlike the descendants of Jonadab the  son of Rechab, who have steadily observed the in-  junctions of their ancestor, this people has refused to  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  listen to Me. Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: See! I am about to bring upon  Judah and upon all the citizens of Jerusalem all the  misery with which I have threatened them, because  they refused to listen to My words or respond to My  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  call." But to the clan of the Rechabites Jeremiah said,  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Because you have obeyed the injunction of your  ancestor Jonadab, keeping all his commandments and  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  fulfiling all his instructions, Jonadab, the son of Rechab  shall never want a man to minister to Me, while the  earth stands. 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Prophecies Committed to Writing, Publicly Read in the Temple,</h4> and Contemptuously Burned by King Jehoiakim 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 36]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah,  king of Judah, Jeremiah received the following message  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  from Jehovah: Take a book-roll, and write on it all  the messages I have communicated to thee with regard  to Israel and Judah and all nations, from My first  message to thee in the days of Josiah right on to the  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  present day. It may be that, when the people of  Judah hear of all the misery I am planning to bring  upon them, they will severally abandon their wicked  ways, and receive at My hands pardon for their guilt  and sin. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then Jeremiah summoned Baruch, the son of Neriah,  who wrote down on a book-roll to Jeremiah’s dic-  tation all the messages Jehovah had communicated to  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  him. Thereafter Jeremiah gave instructions to  Baruch in the following terms: "Seeing that I am  personally under restraint and debarred from access  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  to the Temple, do you go and, on the day appointed  for fasting, read aloud in the Temple the messages of  Jehovah in the hearing of the people from the roll  which you have written to my dictation; read them  also in the hearing of the Judeans who come from their  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  respective country towns. It may be that they will  humbly supplicate Jehovah, and severally abandon  their wicked ways: for great is the anger and fury  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  with which Jehovah has threatened this people." In  accordance, therefore with his instructions from  Jeremiah the prophet, Baruch read aloud from the  book the words of Jehovah in the Temple. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, a sacred fast was  proclaimed by all the people resident in Jerusalem,  and all those also present from the country towns of  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Judah. Then in the hearing of all the people Baruch  read from the book the messages of Jeremiah from the  room that belonged to Gemariah, the son of Shaphan  the Secretary of State, which was situated in the upper  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  court at the entrance to the new Temple gate. Now  when Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of  Shaphan, had heard the messages of Jehovah as they  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  were read from the book, he went down to the palace  to the room of the Secretary of State, and there he found  the whole court seated – Elishama, the Secretary and  Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elanthan, the  son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and  Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and indeed the whole  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  court. Micaiah proceeded to inform them of all the  words he had heard Baruch read out of the book in the  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  hearing of the people. The whole court accordingly  despatched a messenger to Baruch, namely one Jehudi,  the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of  Cushi, with instructions to Baruch to appear, bring-  ing with him the roll from which he had read in the  hearing of the people. So Baruch, the son of Neriah,  appeared before them with the roll in his hand. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then they told him to sit down and read it in their  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  hearing; so Baruch read while they listened. When  they had heard it all, they turned to one another in  consternation, exclaiming to Baruch that they were  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  bound to inform the king of all this. They then  asked Baruch to explain how he had written all these  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  words. Baruch replied that Jeremiah had dictated  them all to him, and he had written them down with  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  ink in the book. "Well, then," said the princes to  Baruch, "go into hiding, you and Jeremiah, and let  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  nobody know where you are." After they had  deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the  Secretary, they visited the king in his apartment,  and reported the whole matter to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The king then despatched Jehudi to fetch the roll;  and, when he had brought it form Elishama’s chamber,  he read it in the hearing of the king and of all the  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  courtiers who were in attendance upon him. Now  the king was sitting in the winter house, and the  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  fire on the brazier was burning before him; and  every three or four columns that Jehudi read, the king  would cut up with his penknife and fling into the fire  that was on the brazier, till the whole roll was con-  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  sumed in the fire that was on the brazier. But there  was no sense of horror either on the part of the king  or of any of his ministers as they listened to all these  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  words, nor did they rend their garments. Elnathan,  Delaiah, and Gemariah, however, had entreated the  king not to burn the roll, but he would not listen to  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  them. Then the king commanded the royal prince  Jerachmeel, and seraiah, the son of Azriel, and  Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribe  and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah kept them in  concealment. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  After the king had burned the roll containing the  words written by Baruch to Jeremiah’s dictation,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Jeremiah received this message from Jehovah, "Once  more take another roll, and write on it all the words  that were on the first roll that was consigned to the  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  flames by Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Thus saith  Jehovah: Thou hast taken it upon thee to burn this  roll and to demand my reason for recording the threat  that the king of Babylon would assuredly come and  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  destroy this land, and clear it of man and beast. There-  fore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of  Judah: Never a man shall he have to sit upon the  throne of David; his dead body shall be flung out and  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night. I  will punish him, his descendants, and his ministers, for  their sins; and I will bring upon them and upon the  citizens of Jerusalem all the misery with which I  threatened them in vain." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then Jeremiah took another roll and gave it to  Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it  to Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the book that  had been burned by Jehoiakim; and it was supple-  mented by many messages of a similar kind. 

<h5>Experiences of Jeremiah During the Siege and at the Capture of Jerusalem</h5>

<h4>Jeremiah Warns King Zedekiah of the Impending Fate of Jerusalem</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 37]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah was reigning in place  of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, having been set upon  the throne of Judah by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Baby-  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  lon; but neither he nor his ministers nor the people  of the land gave any heed to the messages Jehovah  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  had delivered by the prophet Jeremiah. King  Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah,  and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to  Jeremiah, with the request that he would pray for  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  them to Jehovah their God. Now Jeremiah, who had  not yet been put in prison, was still coming and  going among the people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The Chaledeans who were engaged in the siege of  Jerusalem, having received a report that Pharaoh’s  army was advancing from Egypt, abandoned the siege.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then there came to Jeremiah this message from  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah: Tell the king of  Judah who hath sent thee to consult Me, that  Pharaoh’s army which is advancing to your aid  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  shall return to Egypt to their own land; and the  Chaldeans will come back and assault this city  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and take it and burn it with fire. Thus saith Jehovah:  Do not delude yourselves with the idea that the Chal-  deans will leave you for good: they will do nothing of  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the kind. For even if you defeated the whole  Chaldean army that is fighting against you, so com-  pletely that the only survivors were wounded men – a  man to a tent– even they would rise up and burn this  city with fire. 

<h4>Jeremiah Arrested and Imprisoned</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When, in view of the advance of Pharoah’s army,  the Chaldean forces had abandoned the siege of  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Jerusalem, Jeremiah made a journey from Jerusalem  to the district of Benjamin to receive his inheritance  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  among the people. He had just reached the Benjamin  gate when he was apprehended there by a sentry  named Jirijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of  Hananiah, who called out, "You are deserting to the  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Chaldeans." "It is false, said Jeremiah, "I am  not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Jirijah, refusing  to listen, apprehended Jeremiah and brought him  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  before the courtiers, who in their exasperation had  Jeremiah flogged and put in the house of Jonathan,  the Secretary of State, which they had turned into a  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  prison. So Jeremiah found himself in the cells of the  dungeon, where he remained for a considerable time. 

<h4>Amelioration of Jeremiah’s Lot</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then King Zedekiah sent for him and questioned  him secretly in his house whether there was any com-  munication from Jehovah. "There is," said Jeremiah;  "you will be delivered into the hands of the king of  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Babylon. Further," said Jeremiah to the king,  "what is my crime against you or your ministers or  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  this people that you have put me in prison? Where  are your prophets (now) that assured you that the king  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  of Babylon would never invade this country? And  now I beseech your Majesty to listen with favour to my  supplication, and not to allow me to be taken back  to the house of Jonathan the Secretary, where I am  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  likely to perish." Jeremiah was accordingly committed  by royal command to the guard-court, and furnished  with a loaf of bread a day from the Baker’s Street, till  all the bread in the city was consumed. So Jeremiah  remained in the guard-court. 

<h4>Jeremiah Accused of Treason, is Put into a Dungeon, from which he is</h4> Rescued by Ebedmelech, a Foreigner 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 38]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, the  son of Pashhur, and Juca, the son of Shelemiah, and  Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, ahd heard Jeremiah  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  addressing all the people in words like these: "Thus  saith Jehovah: Whoever remains in this city shall die  by sword, famine and perstilence; but whoever goes  over to the Chaldeans shall be spared, though he shall  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  escape with nothing but his life." Also, "Thus saith  Jehovah, This city shall most assuredly be delivered  into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, and  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  it shall be captured." Whereupon those courtiers  said to the king, "We petition you to have this fellow  put to death: this sort of talk is unnerving all the  people and the soldiers left in the city. This fellow  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  does not want to help the city, but to ruin it." "He  is in your power," said the king; for he was helpless  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  against them. So they took Jeremiah and, lowering  him with ropes, they threw him into the cistern of the  royal prince Malchiah, that was in the guard-court.  There was no water in the cistern, but only mud;  and Jeremiah sank in the mud. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now it came to the ears of Ebedmelech, an Ethiopian  eunuch attached to the palace, that they had put  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Jeremiah in the cistern. Ebedmelech accordingly left  the palace for the Benjamin gate where the king  happened to be sitting at the time, and thus he  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  addressed him: "Your Majesty, these men have  behaved most wrongfully in their treatment of Jeremiah  the prophet; they have flung him into the cistern and  he will die of hunger on the spot, for there is no more  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  bread in the city." At once the king ordered  Ebedmelech to take with him three me and pull  Jeremiah out of the cistern before he perished.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Ebedmelech, accordingly, taking the men with him,  went to the palace, and secured form (a lumber room)  underneath the treasury some torn and tattered rags,  and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah into the  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  cistern. Then he told Jeremiah to put the torn and  tattered rags under his armpits beneath the ropes;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and Jeremiah did so. Then they drew him up with the  ropes and pulled him out of the cistern; and Jeremiah  remained in the guard-court. 

<h4>Zedekiah Secretly Consults Jeremiah</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  King Zedekiah afterwards sent and had Jeremiah  brought to him at the third entry that leads into the  Temple; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am going  to ask you a question which you are to answer me  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  unreservedly." "If I tell you," said Jeremiah, "are  you not certain to put me to death? besides, any advice  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I give you, you will simply disregard." Then, in secret,  the king swore the following oath to Jeremiah, "As  Jehovah liveth, who created this life of ours, I assure  you solemnly that I will neither put you to death nor  deliver you into the hands of those men that are seek-  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  ing your life." Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah,  "Thus saith Jehovah, If you surrender voluntarily to  the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be  spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, but  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  you and your family will be spared. If, however, you  refuse to surrender, then this city shall be delivered  into the handso of the Chaldeans, who will burn it with  fire; and you shall not escape from their hands."  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then the king said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the  Jews who have gone over to them and subjected to violence."  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  "No," said Jeremiah, "you will not be handed over.  But I entreat you to listen to what I say – it is the  voice of Jehovah: your happiness and your life depend  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  upon it. But if you refuse to surrender, then this is  the message revealed to me in a vision by Jehovah  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  –mark it well; (I saw) all the women that are left in  the palace of the king of Judah brought out to the chief  officers of the king of Babylon, chanting the while this  song: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Thy most excellent friends have beguiled 

<p class="indent-2"> And prevailed over thee, 

<p class="indent-1"> Thy feet they have thrust in the mire, 

<p class="indent-2"> And thus sinking have left thee. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  All your wives and children they shall bring out to  the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape; you  will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon; and  this city shall be burned with fire." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  "Well, then," said the king to him, "let nobody  know anything of this conversation, or else you are a dead  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  man. If the courtiers hear that I have been talking  with you, and come and ask you to tell them un-  reservedly, on pain of death, what you have been saying  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  to the king and the king to you, then just tell them that  you were presenting a petition to the king that you  should not be taken back to Jonathan’s house, where  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  you were in danger of perishing." In point of fact, the  courtiers did all come to Jeremiah and question him;  and the story he told them was in entire accordance  with the king’s instructions. So they said no more to  him, for no part of the conversation had been heard.  <span class="v-num">[28a]</span>  Jeremiah accordingly remained in the guard-court  till the day Jerusalem was taken. 

<h4>Provision made for Jeremiah’s safety after the Capture of Jerusalem</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28b]</span>  When Jerusalem was taken, all the chief officers of 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 39]</p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  the king of Babylon came and took their seats  in the middle gate – Nergalsharezer the Rab-mag,  Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and all the rest of the  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Officers of the king of Babylon. They sent and had  Jeremiah brought from the guard-court, and delivered  him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of  Shaphan, to be taken to his own home; so he stayed  among the people. 

<h4>The Capture of Jerusalem</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah,  king of Judah, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon came  with all his forces against Jerusalem and laid siege to  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  it. On the ninth day of the fourth month of the  eleventh year of Zedekiah a breach was made in the  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  city. On observing this, Zedekiah, king of Judah, and  all the soldiers took to flight, leaving the city during the  night by way of the royal garden, by the gate between  the two walls, and they made for the Jordan valley.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook  Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho. They seized him  and brought him to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,  who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath, and he  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  pronounced judgment upon them. At Riblah the  king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his  eyes, and all the noblemen of Judah also did the king  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  of Babylon slay. He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes,  and loaded him with chains to carry him to Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The palace and the houses of the people the Chaldeans  burned with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem they  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  demolished. The rest of the people that were left in the  city, and the deserters who had gonve over to him, and  those that werer left of the artificers, Nebuzaradan, the  commander of the guard, carried to exile in Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Some of the poor people who had nothing were left by  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, in the land  of Judah, and presented at the same time with vine-  yards and fields. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  With regard to Jeremiah, Nebuchadrezzar, king of  Babylon, had instructed Nebuzardan, the commander  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  of the guard, to do him no harm, but to take and look  well afer him and treat him according to his own  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  instructions. So a messenger was despatched from  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, and  Nebuzaradan, the Rab-saris, and Nergalsharezer, the  Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of  Babylon. 

<h4>Jeremiah’s Gracious Promise to Ebedmelech</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  During Jeremiah’s detention in the guard-court,  there had come to him this message from Jehovah:  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Go and say to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: I will bring upon  this city all that I have said – for evil and not for good,  and in that day it will be accomplished before thine  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  eyes. But, saith Jehovah, I will deliver thee on that  day, and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  men thou dreadest. I will save thee without fail;  thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thou shalt escape  with thy life, because, saith Jehovah, thou hast put  thy trust in Me. 

<h5>Experiences of Jeremiah After the Capture of Jerusalem</h5>

<h4>Jeremiah Elects to Remain in Palestine</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 40]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah  after he had been released from Ramah by Nebuzar-  adan, the commander of the guard, who had found him  there in chains among the captives of Jerusalem and  Judah, who were being carried to exile in Babylon. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and said  to him: "Jehovah, your God, pronounced this doom  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  upon this place, and He has kept His word. You  have sinned against Him and refused to listen to His  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  voice, and so this thing is come upon you. But see now,  I will release you at once from the chains on your hands.  If you are disposed to accompany me to Babylon  come and I will look well after you; but if not, then  leave it alone. The whole land is before you; go  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  wherever you choose and prefer. Go back to Gedaliah,  the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king  of Babylon has appointed Governor of the cities of  Judah: stay with him among the people or go wherever  you choose." Then the commander of the guard  dismissed him with a gift of provisions and a present.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah at Mizpah, where he  stayed with him among the people left in the land. 

<h4>Assassination of Gedaliah the Governor of Judah</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When all the commanders of the forces in the open  field, together with their men, heard that the king of  Babylon had appointed Gedaliah Governor of the land,  and charged him with the oversight of the men, women  and children, and of the poorest of the land, such as  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  had not been carried to exile in Babylon, they came  with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah – Ishmael the  son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of  Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of  Ephai of Netophah, and Jezaniah, the son of the  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Maacathite. And Gedaliah gave his oath to them and  their men: "Don’t be afraid," he said, "of the  Chaldean officials. You will prosper if you stay in the  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  land and serve the king of Babylon. As for myself,  I will reside at Mizpah, to represent your interests  when the Chaldean (officials) visit us; and you can  gather wine, fruit, and oil, and store them up and live  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  in the towns you take possession of." Further, all the  Jews that were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, or elsewhere,  when they heard that the king of Babylon had granted  permission to some to remain in Judah and had ap-  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  pointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Governor, they  all returned to Judah from all the places to which they  had been driven – to Gedaliah at Mizpah – and they  gathered immense stores of wine and fruit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the com-  manders of the forces in the open field came to Gedaliah  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  at Mizpah, and asked him whether he was aware  that Baalis king of Ammon had sent Ishmael the son of  Nethaniah to assasiante him. But Gedaliah would  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  not believe it. Then Johanan, in a secret audience with  Gedaliah at Mizpah, said to him: "I beseech you to  allow me to go and slay Ishmael. Nobody need know.  Why should he take your life? that will mean the  scattering of all the Jews that have gathered round  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  you, and the ruin of all that is left of Judah." "No,"  said Gedaliah to Johanan, "do nothing of the kind:  what you say of Ishmael is not true." 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 41]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the seventh month, however, Ishamael, the son  of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, a member of the  royal family, accompanied by one of the chief officers of  the king and ten (other) men, paid a visit to Gedaliah  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  at Mizpah. While they were all dining together there,  Ishmael and the ten men who accompanied him rose  and with the sword smote and slew Gedaliah, whom the  king of Babylon had appointed Governor of the land,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  together with all the Jews who were with him in  Mizpah and all the Chaldean soldiers who happened  to be there. 

<h4>Murder of Pilgrims and Flight of Gedaliah’s Assasin</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The day after the murder of Gedaliah, of which no  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  one was yet aware, eighty pilgrims from Shechem,  Shiloh, and Samaria, with beards shaven, clothes rent  and gashes (on their bodies), came with vegetable offer-  ings and frankincense in their hand to present them at  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went out from Mizpah  to meet them, and they were weeping as they went  along. When he meet them, he invited them to come to  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Gedaliah; but when they were well within the town,  he and the men who accompanied him slew them at  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  the cistern. Ten of their number, however, entreated  Ishmael not to kill them: "for we have stores of  wheat," they said, "and barley, oil, and honey, buried  in the ground." So he let them alone and did not  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  consign them to the doom of their brethren. Now  the cistern into which Ishmael had cast all the corpses  of the men he had slain was the great cistern which  had been constructed by king Asa in his war against  Baasha, king of Israel; and this Ishmael filled with the  slain. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the  people that were at Mizpah, the princesses and all the  people left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the com-  mander of the guard, had committed to the charge of  Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam; and he started across to  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Ammon. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and  all the commanders of the forces that were with him,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  heard of all the atrocities perpetrated by Ishmael, they  took all their men and set out to attack him; and they  <span class="v-num">[13a]</span>  found him by the great waters of Gibeon. All the  <span class="v-num">[14a]</span>  people with Ishmael – all that he had carried captive  <span class="v-num">[13b]</span>  from Mizpah – when they saw Johanan and the com-  manders of the forces that were with him, were filled  <span class="v-num">[14b]</span>  with joy; and turning about, they came back and  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  joined Johanan. But Ishmael, escaping with eight  men, repaired to Ammon. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then Johanan and all the commanders of the forces  that were with him, tool all the rest of the people whom  Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah, after  his assassination of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam – men,  women, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Gibeon. Then they took their journey and stayed  awhile at the sheepfolds of Chimham in the neighbour-  hood of Bethlehem, from which they intended to  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  travel to Egypt; for they were in terror of the  Chaldeans, because Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah,  whom the king of Babylon had appointed Governor of  the land. 

<h4>Migration of the Jews to Egypt in Defiance of Jeremiah’s Counsel</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 42]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then all the commanders of the forces, together  with Johanan, and Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  all the people great and small, approached Jeremiah  the prophet with a petition, which they commended to  his most favourable consideration, that he would pray  for them, remnant as they were, to Jehovah his God.  "We are left," they said, "but a few out of many, as  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  you see with your own eyes. Let Jehovah your God  tell us the way we should go and the things we should do."  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jeremiah replied, "I have heard you; I promise to  pray to Jehovah our God, as you request; and what-  ever be Jehovah’s answer I will tell you unreservedly."  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Whereupon they said to Jeremiah, "Jehovah be our  true and faithful Witness that we will act entirely in  accordance with any message that Jehovah your God  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  may send us. We have sent you to Jehovah our God;  and, be it welcome or unwelcome, we will obey His  voice, and so enjoy the prosperity that comes from  obedience to the voice of Jehovah our God." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After an interval of ten days, Jeremiah received a  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  message from Jehovah. He accordingly summoned  Johanan and all the commanders of the forces that  were with him, and all the people, small and great,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and thus he addressed them. "Thus saith Jehovah,  the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  supplication: If you remain quitely in this land, I will  build you up and not throw you down; I will plant you  and not pluck you up: for I am grieved at the misery  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I have brought upon you. You are afraid of the king of  Babylon, but do not be afraid of him, saith Jehovah;  do not be afraid of him, for I will be with you, to save  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  you and to deliver you from his hand. I will have  pity upon you and inspire him with pity for you, so  that he will allow you to remain in your own land.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You may, however, disregard the voice of Jehovah your  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  God, and refuse to remain in this land: you may say,  ’No; we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall  see no war and hear no sound of trumpet and never  suffer for lack of bread – and there we shall make our  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  home.’ In that case I call upon you that are left of  Judah to listen to the message of Jehovah. Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you are really  determined to proceed to Egypt, and if you go and settle  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake you  there in the land of Egypt, and the hunger that you  dread shall cling to your heels there in Egypt, and there  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  ye shall die; and all the men that were determined  to go and settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, famine,  and pestilence; not one shall survive or escape the dis-  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  aster that I will bring upon them. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine anger  and fury have been poured out upon the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured out upon you  when ye enter Egypt; and ye shall be an object of  execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and ye  shall see this place no more. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This is Jehovah’s message to you that are left of  Judah: ’Do not go to Egypt.’ But now be very sure  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  of this – I this day lay witness against you; you have  done yourselves a grievous wrong. You have sent  me to Jehovah your God with the request that I should  pray for you to Jehovah, and promising to act in  entire accordance with the will of Jehovah when I  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  declared it to you; but when I did declare it this day,  you refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah in respect  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  of any part of my commission. Now therefore be very  sure of this, that ye shall die by the sword, famine,  and pestilence, in the land where it is your desire to  go and settle." 

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 43]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jeremiah had finished addressing to the  assembled people all these words with which Jehovah  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  had commissioned him, Azariah, the son of Hoshaniah,  and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the defiant and  insolent men exclaimed to Jeremiah, "You are a liar;  you have no commission to us from Jehovah to warn  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  us against going and settling in Egypt; but it is Baruch  the son of Neriah who is setting you on against us with  the object of delivering us into the hands of the  Chaldeans, to be killed or transported to Babylon."  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Johanan and all the commanders of the forces and  all the people refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah  which urged them to remain in the land of Judah.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Accordingly Johanan and all the commanders of the  forces took all that were now left of Judah – those that  had come back from all the nations to which they had  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  been driven, to settle in the land of Judah – the men,  the women, the princesses, and all the persons whom  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had left  in the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son  of Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  the son of Neriah; and, disregarding the voice of  Jehovah, they went to Egypt and arrived at Daphnae. 

<h4>Jeremiah Predicts the Conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadrezzar</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In Daphnae Jeremiah received the following message  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  from Jehovah: "Take large stones in thy hand and  hide them away in secret at the porch of Pharaoh’s  residence in Daphnae in the presence of a few of the  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  men of Judah, and say to them, Thus saith Jehovah:  Mark this well – I will send and bring Nebuchadrezzar  the king of Babylon My servant, who shall set his  throne above these stones thou hast buried and spread  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  his glistening tapestry over them. He shall come and  smite the land of Egypt, devoting to death those  doomed to death, to captivity those doomed to captivity,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  to the sword those doomed to the sword. He shall  kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, he shall  clear the land of Egypt, as a shepherd clears his mantle  of vermin, and then he shall depart from it in comfort.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Also he will shatter the obelisks of Bethshemesh, in the  land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he  will burn with fire. 

<h4>Jeremiah Denounces the Jews in Egypt for their Idolatrous Worship of the Queen of Heaven</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 44]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Concerning all the Jews whose home was in Egypt–  at Migdol, Daphnae, Memphis, and in upper Egypt–  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jeremiah received the following message: "Thus  saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have  seen with your own eyes all the misery that I have  wrought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of  Judah. Ye see what they are to-day – desolate and  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  uninhabited – as a consequence of their wicked be-  haviour which provoked Mine indignation; for they  went and burned sacrifice in the service of other gods,  unknown alike to them or to you or your forefathers;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and that, though early and late I had been sending to you  My servants the prophets to warn you against these  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  abominable practices that I detest. But they refused  to listen or incline their ear: they would no abandon  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  their wickedness or cease sacrificing to other gods. And  so Mine anger and fury were poured forth: it blazed in  the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, so  that they became the waste and the desolation that  they are to-day. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now, therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts,  the God of Israel: Why are ye doing yourselves this  great wrong, which can only end in the utter extermin-  ation of Judah, man and woman, child and babe?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Why are ye vexing Me with the fabrications of your  hands, burning sacrifice to other gods in the land of  Egypt, where ye have come to settle? All this  can only end in your extermination and in your being  cursed and scorned by every nation in the world.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Have you forgotten the crimes of your forefathers and  of the kings and princes of Judah, the crimes, too,  your own wives committed in the land of Judah and on  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they have  remained unhumbled and unafraid. They have not  lived in accordance with My law or with the statutes  I set before you and your forefathers.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of  Israel: Mark this – I will set My face against you for  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Evil, to exterminate Judah utterly. I will take the  remnant of Judah that were determined to come and  settle in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Egypt  they shall all be consumed; they shall fall by the sword  and by famine; small and great, they shall die by the  sword and by famine, and they shall be an object of  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and,  as I have punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and  pestilence, so will I punish those that have made Egypt  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  their home, that not a man of the remnant of Judah  which has come to settel in Egypt shall escape or  survive to return to the land of Egypt for which  they shall yearn; for none but a fugitive or two  shall return." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the great gathering, composed of all the men  who were aware that their wives burned sacrifice to  other gods, and all the women that were standing by,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  replied to Jeremiah thus: "We refuse to listen to this  message of yours that you have communicated to us in  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  the name of Jehovah: but we will most assuredly  keep our solemn oath to burn sacrifice to the Queen  of Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in her  honour as we used to do – we and our fathers, our  kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and on the  streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  lived well and were untouched by misfortune. But  ever since the day we ceased burning sacrifice to the  Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink-offerings in  her honour, we have been utterly destitute, and sword  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and famine have consumed us. Yes," said the women,  "as for our offering of sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven  and pouring out drink-offerings in her honour – have  we not had the approval of our husbands in making cakes  for her stamped with her image, and in pouring her  out drink-offerings?" 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Such was the answer of all the people, men and  women. Then Jeremiah addressed them as follows:  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  "Yes, you did indeed burn your sacrifices in the cities of  Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem – you and your  fathers, your kings and your princes and commons;  and is it not precisely this that rankled in the mind and  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  heart of Jehovah, till He could bear your wicked and  abominable conduct no longer, with the result that your  country is become the uninhabited desolation, the  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  horror, the curse that it is to-day? It is because you  have offered such sacrifces, sinning against Jehovah, dis-  obeying the voice of Jehovah, refusing to live in  accordance with His laws. His statutes, His expressed  will: that is why the misery of to-day is come upon  you." 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Further, Jeremiah said to the people and the women  assembled: "Listen to the message of Jehovah, all ye  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Jews that are in the land of Egypt. Thus saith Jehovah  of Hosts, the God of Israel: Verily you women  have indeed carried out your solemn resolve faithfully  to perform the vows you have taken upon you, to burn  sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink-  offerings in her honour. Well, then, keep your word  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and perform your vows. But listen now to the world of  Jehovah, all ye Jews who have made Egypt your home.  Mark this well: I have sworn, saith Jehovah, by My  great name, that never again in all the land of Egypt  shall My name be uttered by the lips of any man of  Judah in the oath ’As truly as the Lord Jehovah  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  liveth.’ Mark! I am watching over them for evil  and not for good; and every man of Judah in the  land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  famine, until there be an end of them. Some who  escape the sword in Egypt shall return to Judah, but  they shall be few in number; and then all the remnant  of Judah that have some to settle in Egypt shall know  whose word it is that stands – Mine or theirs. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  And this, saith Jehovah, shall be to you the sign  that I will punish you in this place, to teach you that  My threats of disaster shall be confirmed upon you.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Thus saith Jehovah: I will give Pharaoh Hophra, king  of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies and of those that  seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah, king of Judah, into  the hands of Nebuchadrezzar. king of Babylon, his  enemy that sought his life." 

<h4>Words of Mingled Rebuke and Promise Addressed to Baruch</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 45]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet  delivered to Baruch the son of Neriah, after he had  written these words in a book to Jeremiah’s dictation  in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  of Judah. "This, Baruch, is the message to thee from  Jehovah, the God of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Thou hast said, ’Woe is me! for Jehovah 

<p><p class="indent-2"> to my pain hath added sorrow; 

<p class="indent-1"> With groaning I am weary, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I have found no rest.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Let this be thy message to him, Thus saith Jehovah:  When I must destroy what I built, 

<p><p class="indent-2"> And when I must uproot what I planted, 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Shalt thou seek great things for thyself? 

<p><p class="indent-2"> Seek them not; for, behold, I will bring 

<p class="indent-2"> On all flesh, saith Jehovah, disaster; 

<p class="indent-1"> But thou, wheresoever thou comest, 

<p class="indent-2"> By My grace, shalt escape with thy life."

<h4>Jeremiah’s Message to Babylon, Symbolic of her Doom</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  The instructions given by Jeremiah the prophet to  Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, who  acted as quester-master, when he accompanied  Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  Year of his reign. Now Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  all the misery that was to come upon Babylon; and  he said to Seraiah, "When you arrive at Babylon, see  <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  that you read all these words, and say: ’Thine, O  Jehovah, are these words; it is Thou that hast decreed  the destruction of this place – that never again shall it  be a home for man or beast, but that it shall remain a  <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  desolation for ever.’ When you have finished reading  this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle  <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  of the Euphrates, with the words: ’Thus shall Babylon  sink, to rise no more, because of all the misery that I  shall bring upon her.’" 

<p> Here end the words of Jeremiah. 

<h4>The Capture of Jerusalem and the Exile of the People</h4>

<p class="c-num">[Jeremiah 52]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Zedekiah, who was twenty-one years of age when he  came to the throne, reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.  His mother’s name was Hamutal, a daughter of  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jeremiah of Libnah. His actions were offensive to  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jehovah was so angry with Jerusalem and Judah that  He cast them out of His sight; and Zedekiah revolted  against the king of Babylon. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth  year of his reign Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,  came with all his forces to storm Jerusalem. They  pitched their camp against it, and surrounded it with  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  a siege-wall; so the city was undersiege till the eleventh  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  year of king Zedekiah. In the ninth day of the fourth  month – the famine in the city being so severe that  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  there was no bread for the people of the land – a  breach was made in the city, and all the soldiers took  to flight, leaving the city during the night by way of the  gate between the two walls by the royal garden–  the city being surrounded by the Chaldeans – and they  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  made for the Jordan valley. But the Chaldean army  pursued the king and overtook him in the steppes of  Jericho, all his own army having left him and scattered.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They seized the king and brought him to the king of  Babylon who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and he pronounced judgment upon him. At Riblah  the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before  his eyes, and all the princes of Judah did he also slay;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  he then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and having loaded him  with chains, he carried him to Babylon, where he kept  him in the House of Discipline till the day of his death. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On the tenth day of the fifth month of the nineteenth  year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,  Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, one of the  ministers of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and he proceeded to burn the Temple, the palace, and  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  indeed every house in Jerusalem. All the walls that  encircled Jerusalem were demolished by the Chaldean  forces that were under the commander of the guard.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The rest of the people left in the city, and the deserters  who had gone over the king of Babylon, and those  that were left of the artificers, were carried into exile by  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard. Some of  the poorest of the country people were left by Nebuzar-  adan, the commander of the guard, to act as vine-  dressers and ploughmen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The bronze pillars of the Temple, and the stands,  and the bronze sea that was in the Temple, were broken  in pieces by the Chaldeans, and all the bronze of them  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  was taken to Babylon. They also took the pots and  the shovels and the snuffers and the basons and the  pans and all the bronze vessels used in the (Temple)  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  service. The goblets and the snuff-dishes (for the  lamps) and the basons and the pots and the lamp-  stands and the pans and the libation bowls – whatever  was of gold or silver respectively – were removed by the  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  commander of the guard: – the pillars, two; the sea  one; and the bronze bulls that supported the sea,  twelve; and the stands which King Solomon had  made for the Temple, ten; – vessels the mass of whose  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  bronze was beyond weight. Each of the pillars was  twenty-seven feet in height, eighteen feet in circum-  ference, three inches in thickness, and hollow within.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  It was surmounted by a bronze capital, seven feet and a  half in height, round which ran network and pome-  granates of bronze throughout; the (network and)  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  pomogranate adorment of both pillars was alike. On  the network round about there were a hundred pome-  granates in all, of which ninety-six were visible. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The commander of the guard also took Seraiah the  chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  three keepers of the threshold. He took also from the  city a eunuch who had charge of the soldiers, and seven  of the King’s Privy Councillors who were found in  the city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief,  who kept the army register, and sixty of the people of  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  the land whom he found within the city. Having  seized them, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard,  brought them to Riblah to the king of Babylon;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  and the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah  in the district of Hamath. Thus was Judah carried  from her own land into exile. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  These are the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried  into exile; in the seventeenth year (of his reign)  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  three thousand and twenty-three Jews; in the eight-  eenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, eight hundred and  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  thirty-two persons from Jerusalem; in the twenty-  third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the  commander of the guard carried seven hundred and  forty-five Jews into exile: – in all, four thousand  six hundred. 

<h4>A Gleam of Light in the Darkness of Exile</h4>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  In the thirty seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin,  king of Judah, in the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth  month, Evil-merodach, in the year of his accession to  the throne of Babylon, restored Jehoiachin, king of  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Judah, to favour, liberated him from prison, engaged  him in friendly intercourse, and gave him precedence  over the (other) kings who were (detained) with him  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  in Babylon. He also changed his prison dress, and he  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  dined at the royal table to the very end of his life. A  perpetual allowance, which was disbursed daily, was  assigned him by the king of Babylon, and he continued  to enjoy it all his life up to the day that he died.

<h1>The Book of Daniel</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 1]</p>

<h5>Nebuchadnezzar’s court</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  handed King Jehoiakim over to him, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them off to the land of Shinar to the temple of his god, and placed them in the temple treasury. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The king commanded Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring to him some of the Israelite princes and nobles.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They were to be young men who were without physical defect and handsome, comfortable with all types of knowledge, well taught and quick to learn and able to serve in the king’s palace. They were to be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The king gave to them each day some of his rich food and some of the wine which he drank.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He also commanded that they should be taught for three years, and that at the end of that time they should enter the royal service. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Among these young men were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but the chief of the king’s eunuchs gave other names to them. To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abednego. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But Daniel made up his mind not to become ritually unclean by being contaminated by the rich food of the king nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked the chief of the king’s eunuchs to help him avoid it.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God helped Daniel to win the kindness and favor of the chief. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear that my lord, the king, who has given you your food and your drink, will see that your faces are sadder than those of young men who are your own age, and so you will endanger my head with the king.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Daniel went to the guardian whom the chief of the eunuchs had put over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and said  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “Test us for ten days; and let us have vegetables to eat and water to drink.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then compare the way we look with that of the young men who eat of the king’s rich food. Then do to us as seems best.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So he did as they asked and tested them for ten days.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  At the end of ten days they looked better and they were healthier than all the young men who ate the king’s rich food.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So the guardian took away their rich food and the wine and gave them vegetables. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To these four young men God gave knowledge, learning, and wisdom; and Daniel understood all kinds of visions and dreams. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  On the date which the king had fixed for introducing all the young men to the court, the chief of his eunuchs brought them to Nebuchadnezzar,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and the king talked with them. But not one of all the young men was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve the king.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  On every subject which called for wisdom and understanding and about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the wise men and magicians who were in his entire kingdom. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Daniel remained at the court until the start of the reign of King Cyrus. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 2]</p>

<h5>A king’s strange dream</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Nebuchadnezzar in the second year of his reign had dreams, and his mind was so troubled that he could not sleep.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then the king sent for the magicians and the wise men, and the Chaldaens (who studied the stars) to tell him what his dreams meant. So they came in before the king,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and he said to them, “I have had a dream and my mind is troubled, for I want to know what the dream means.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then those who studied the stars said to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will tell you what it means.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The king answered, “What I now say is certain: if you do not tell me the dream and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be maderuins.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But if you tell the dream and what it means, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honors; therefore tell me the dream and what it means.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They answered the second time, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will tell what it means.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The king replied, “I see clearly that you wish to gain time, for you know that what I have said is certain,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and that if you do not tell the dream to me, you will all suffer the same punishment. So you have planned to speak lying and false words before me, until the time when it is to happen has passed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me what it means.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The Chaldeans answered the king, “There is no man on earth who can do what the king asks, for no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any wise man or magician, or of one who studies the stars.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  What the king asks is too hard. There is no one else who can tell it to the king, except the gods, who do not live among mortals.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  This made the king very angry and he ordered all the wise men of Babylon put to death. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So the command was given that the wise men were to be put to death. Search was made for Daniel and his friends that they too might be put to death.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Daniel approached Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to put the wise men of Babylon to death, and quietly and carefully asked,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Why is the king’s command so harsh?” When Arioch told Daniel the facts,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  he went to the king and asked that he give him time to tell what the dream meant. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Daniel went to his house and told the facts to his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, so that they might beg the God of heaven to be kind to them and to tell Daniel this secret, so that they might not die with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then the secret was told to Daniel in a vision at night, and he praised the God of heaven and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Blessed be the name of God 

<p class="indent-2"> from everlasting to everlasting! 

<p class="indent-2"> For wisdom and power are his. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He controls the seasons and times, 

<p class="indent-2"> he removes and installs kings, 

<p class="indent-1"> He gives wisdom to the wise, 

<p class="indent-2"> and knowledge to those who have insight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He shows the deep, secret things; 

<p class="indent-2"> he knows what is in the darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the light of truth dwells in him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  God of my fathers: 

<p class="indent-2"> I give you thanks and praise, 

<p class="indent-1"> For you gave me wisdom and strength, 

<p class="indent-2"> and havemade known the things we asked; 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> You have made known to us the king’s secret!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had commanded to kill the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not kill the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel to the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the captives from Judah who will tell you what this dream means.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The king said to Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar), “Can you make known to me the dream which I have had and what it means?”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Daniel answered, “The secret which the king asks is something that neither wise men, magicians, nor those who study the stars can make known to him;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  but there is a God in heaven who tells secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will come in the future. Your dream and the visions which you had as you lay asleep are these: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “The thoughts which came into your mind on your bed concerned what will happen in the future. The one who reveals secrets has made known to you what will come to pass.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  This secret was not revealed to me because I am wiser than other living people, but so that the king might learn the interpretation: so that you might understand the thoughts that have come to you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  “You, O king, had a vision and saw a great image. That image was large and it was exceedingly bright as it stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The head of the image was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its body and its thighs of bronze,  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  You looked at it until a stone was cut out, not by human hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff which blows from the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away so that nothing was left of them. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the earth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “This is the dream, and we will tell the king what it means:  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  O king, you are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the rule, the power, the strength, and the glory.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Over the whole world he has given into your power, people, the wild beasts and the birds, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “After you will rise another kingdom not so strong as you are, and a third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over the whole earth.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  A fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, for iron breaks in pieces and shatters all things, and like iron which crushes, it will break in pieces and crush all things.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  As you saw the feet and toes, part clay and part iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it some of the strength of the iron, for you saw the iron mixed with clay.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly broken.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  You saw the iron mixed with clay, for the ruling families will arrange marriage alliances between each other, but they will not stick together, just as iron does not stick to clay. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  “During the reigns of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will the power be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and destroy all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  This is shown by the fact that you saw a stone cut out of the mountain, but not with human hands<>. It broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. 

<p> “The great God has made known to the king what is to come, and the dream is real and this meaning true.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and ordered that a sacrifice and sweet odors should be offered to him.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  The king also said to Daniel, “Your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and one who tells his secrets to his servant, for you have been able to tell this great secret.”  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Then the king gave Daniel a high position and many costly gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief over all the wise men in Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  But at Daniel’s request the king placed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the province of Babylon; while Daniel stayed in the king’s court. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 3]</p>

<h5>The test by fire</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Nebuchadnezzar, the king, made a statue of gold ninety feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then he sent for the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So the officers, the governors, the judges, the treasurers, and all the rulers of the provinces all came together for the dedication and stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations:  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The moment you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you must fall down and worship the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So when all the people heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and the speakers of all languages fell down and worshipped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But at that time certain Chaldeans came near to the king and made this accusation against the Jews:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “O king, live forever! O king, you have commanded that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble must fall down and worship the golden statue,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  There are certain Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, whom you have placed in charge of the province of Babylon. These men, O king, have not obeyed your command; they do not serve your gods nor worship the golden statue which you have set up.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury gave command to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When they were brought before the king, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my god nor worship the golden statue which I have set up?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  If you are now ready, as soon as you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, to fall down and worship the statue which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you will at once be thrown into a burning, fiery furnace. Where is there a god who can deliver you out of my hands?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O king, there is no need of our answering you about this.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Our God whom we serve is able to save us from the burning, fiery furnace; he will save us out of your hand, O king.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But if not, know, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry and the appearance of his face changed, as he looked at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than usual.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He also commanded certain strong men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and throw them into the burning, fiery furnace.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their robes, and their other garments, and were thrown into the burning, fiery furnace.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As the king’s command was urgent and the furnace very hot, the flames destroyed the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the midst of the burning, fiery furnace. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was so astonished that he rose up hastily and said to his counsellors, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the fire?” They answered, “True, O king.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He said, “Now I see four men, unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unhurt, and the fourth looks like a god.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the door of the burning, fiery furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The officers, governors, and counsellors who were there saw that the fire had no power over the bodies of these men, and that the hair of their heads was not singed and that their cloaks were not harmed, and that there was no smell of fire. And  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel to save his servants who trusted in him and refused to obey the king’s command and have offered their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Therefore I command that every people, nation, and speaker of every language that says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut in pieces and their house will be made a ruin, for there is no other god who is so able to save as is this one.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then the king gave high positions, in the province of Babylon, to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 4]</p>

<h5>The king’s madness</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May your peace be great.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  How great are his signs! And how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rule lasts from generation to generation. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and prosperous in my palace.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I saw a dream that made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told the dream to them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But at last there came before me Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream to him:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the secret visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The tree grew and was strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it could be seen to the end of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; the animals of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens nested in its branches, and every kind of living being was fed from it.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I saw in the visions of my head on my bed a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He cried aloud, ‘Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the animals get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, with a band of iron and bronze; bound with iron and bronze he will be fed with the grass of the field, and wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion will be with the animals.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  His mind will be changed so that it will not be that of a man, and an animals’s mind will be given to him, and seven times will pass over him.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the affair by the word of the holy ones, that the living may know that the Most High rules over human kingdoms of gives them to whoever he will, and can set up as ruler the humblest of people.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, O Belteshazzar, must declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dumfounded for a moment, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, I wish the dream applied to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries!  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The tree which you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  whose leaves were fair, and whose fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which the animals sheltered, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their nests,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  is you, O king – you who are great and strong; and your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  You saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, and saying. Hew down the tree and destroy it.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  You will be driven from people, and your dwelling will be with the animals of the field, and you will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he will.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And as they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, so your kingdom will be secure to you as soon as you recognize that the heavens do rule.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteous works, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; then perhaps there may be a continuation of your prosperity.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar:  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The king said, “Is not this great Babylon which I have built for a residence, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has passed away from you,  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and you will be driven from people, and your home will be with the animals of the field; you will be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in human kingdoms and gives them to whom he will.”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from people, and ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  At the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom lasts generation to generation;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and all the inhabitants of the earth are considered as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and no oone can stay his hand, or say to him. What are you doing?  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  At that same time my reason returned to me, and for the sake of my royal honor, my majesty and my kingly appearance were restored to me. Then my counsellors and my nobles sought eagerly for me; and I was established in my kingdom, and still greater power was added to me.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 5]</p>

<h5>The handwriting on the wall</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Belshazzar, the king, made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine before them all.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Under the influence of wine, he gave command to bring the gold and silver utensils which his father, Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the temple at Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines might drink from them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So they brought the golden vessels which were taken from the temple of God which was at Jerusalem. The king, his nobles, his wives, and concubines drank from them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote opposite the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the king grew pale, and fear filled his mind, his legs trembled and his knees knocked together.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He called for the magicians and the Chaldeans (who study the stars) and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold about his neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing nor tell the king what it meant.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face grew pale, and his nobles were thrown into confusion. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now the queen, because of what the king and his nobles had said, came into the banquet-house and said, “O king, live forever; let not your thoughts trouble you nor let yourself grow pale.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the days of your father he was found to have light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, put him in charge of all the magicians, Chaldeans and those who study the stars.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  for an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, the interpreting of dreams and explaining of riddles and the solving of difficulties were found in this same Daniel, whose name the king changed to Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will tell what it means.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you that Daniel, one of the men who were carried away captive, whom the king, my father, brought from Judah?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have understanding and great wisdom.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The wise men and the magicians have been brought in before me to read this writing and to tell what it means; but they are not able.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I have heard that you can tell what dreams mean and answer hard questions. Now if you can read the writing and tell what it means, you will be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about your neck and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Daniel answered the king, “Keep your gifts and give your rewards to another. Without them I will read the writing to the king, and tell what it means.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar, your father, the kingdom and power, glory and majesty.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Because of the power that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and races trembled and feared him. He killed or kept alive as he wished; and he raised up or put down whom he pleased.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But when he became proud and haughty, he was made to come down from his kingly throne and his glory was taken from him,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and he was driven away from men, and his mind became like that of the beasts, and he lived with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over the realm of humanity and that he sets up over it whom he will. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “But you, his son Belshazzar, have not been humble, though you knew all this,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  but you have raised yourself against the Lord of heaven, and have had the utensils of his temple brought before you, and you, your nobles, your wives, and the others of your household have drunk wine from them. You have given praise to the gods of silver, of gold, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which cannot see nor hear nor know; and you have not praised the God in whose control are your very breath and all that you do.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “Then the hand was sent out before him and traced this writing: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  “This is what it means: Mene: God has numbered the days your kingdom and brought it to an end.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Tekel: you are weighed in the scales and found wanting.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Upharsin: your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then at Belshazzar’s command Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold was put about his neck, and he was proclaimed the third ruler in the kingdom.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But on that very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and Darius, the Mede, who was sixty-two years old, received the kingdom. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 6]</p>

<h5>Daniel in the lions’ den</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty officers who ruled the whole kingdom,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and over them three chief officials, of whom Daniel was one, so that these officers might report to them and that the king should lose nothing.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Daniel was better than the other chief officials and the officers, for he had a fine spirit; and the king intended to set him over the whole empire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then the chief officials and the officers tried to find a way to accuse Daniel of not having done his duty, but they could not find anything against him, for he was faithful and was not guilty of any mistake or wrong-doing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then these men said, “We will not find any way to accuse this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So these chief officials and officers all went to the king, and said to him, “King Darius, live forever.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  All the chief officials of the kingdom, the counsellors and the officers, the judges and the governors, have consulted together to have the king make a law and give a strong command that whoever will ask a petition of any god or person for thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into a den of lions.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now, O king, give the command and sign the law that, like the law of the Medes and Persians, it may not be changed.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So King Darius signed the law and the command. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When Daniel learnt that the law was signed, he went into his house. His windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem, and he knelt upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks to his God as he had done before.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then these men rushed in and found Daniel praying and calling upon his God.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So they went before the king and spoke to him about the royal command: “Have you not signed a command, that everyone who asks a petition of any person or god within thirty days, except of you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?” The king answered, “The rule is fixed according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then they went on to say to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, nor to the command that you have signed, but prays three times a day.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When the king heard these words, he was greatly displeased, and set his heart on saving Daniel, and he worked until the sun set to save him.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then these men all went to the king and said to him, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no command nor law which the king gives may be changed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So the king gave his command, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, “Your God, whom you always serve, will save you.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then a stone was brought and laid at the entrance to the den; and the king sealed it with his own seal-ring and with those of his nobles, that no change might be made so as to rescue Daniel.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fastingalone; he could not sleep. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king rose and hurried to the den of lions.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he called anxiously, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to save you from the lions?”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  My God has sent his angel and has closed the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me, for I was innocent before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then the king was very glad and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and it was found that he was not injured, for he had trusted in his God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then the king commanded that those men who had accused Daniel should be brought and thrown into the den of lions, with their wives and children. Before they reached the floor of the den, the lions pounced on them and tore them to pieces. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and races in all his kingdom, “May your peace be great!  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  I make a law that throughout all my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and is the same forever, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed; and his rule will be without end.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  He saves and rescues, and does wonderful things in heaven and earth; it is he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So Daniel was successful and happy during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 7]</p>

<h5>Vision of the great beasts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “I saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. I looked until its wings were stripped off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a person; and a human heart was given to it.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And I saw a second beast, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth, between its teeth; and they said to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After this I saw another like a leopard, which had upon its sides four wings of a bird; and the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After this I saw in the night-visions a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the rest with its feet; and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  While I considered the horns, another little horn came up among them, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; in this horn were eyes, like human eyes, and a mouth speaking arrogrant things. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “I waited until thrones were set up, and an aged one took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and his hair like spotless wool, his throne was fiery flames, its wheels burning fire.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  A fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books were opened. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “I looked at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words which the horn spoke – I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to be fuel for the fire.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Also the rule of the rest of the beasts was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a fixed time and season. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “I saw in the night-visions that there came with the clouds of heaven one like a human being, and he came even to the Aged One, and was brought near before him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  There was given him dominion and glory, and sovereignty, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away, and his sovereignty one which will not be destroyed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved by reason of this, and the visions of my head troubled me.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me the interpretation of the things:  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “These four great beasts are four kings who will arise out of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, and possess the sovereignty for ever, for ever and ever. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet:  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three horns fell – it that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, and it appeared to be greater than the rest.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I looked, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  until the Aged One came, and judgment was given to the holy one of the Most High, and the fixed time came that the holy ones possessed the sovereignty. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Thus he said: “The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms; and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the holy ones of the Most High; and he will think to change the fixed times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his kingdom, to consume and to destroy finally.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The sovereignty, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will surely be given to the holy people of the Most High; his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and all dominions will serve and obey him.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and I turned pale, but I kept the matter in my mind. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 8]</p>

<h5>Vision of the ram and goat</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision came to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me previously. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I saw in a vision – and when I saw, I was in the Shushan, the royal palace, which is in the province of Elam – and I saw in a vision, and I was by the River Ulai.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then I looked up and saw standing before the river a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could escape, but he did as he pleased and exulted himself. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  As I was observing, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He came to the ram that had two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I saw him come close to the ram, and he was angered against him, and stuck the ram, and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to stand before him, but he threw him down to the ground and trampled upon him, and none could rescue the ram from him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The he-goat exulted himself exceedingly; and when he had become strong, the great horn was broken. In its place there came up four other horns toward the four winds of heaven. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Out of one of them came another little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host, and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  It exulted itself even to the prince of the host, and took away from him the daily sacrifice, and threw down the place of his sanctuary,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and it set up the sacrilegious tithing over the daily sacrifice, and threw down truth to the ground, and did it and prospered. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one who spoke, “For how long will the vision be that the daily sacrifice will be taken away and the appalling sacrilege set up and the sanctuary and the host trampled under foot?”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He answered, “For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then will the sanctuary be justified.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and suddenly there stood before me one who had the appearance of a man.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I heard a human voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, “Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So he came near where I stood; and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face, but he said to me, “Understand, mortal, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright in my place.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He said, “I will make you know what will be in the time of wrath, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The ram which you saw, with the two horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As for that which was broken so that four stood up in its place, four kingdoms will arise out of his nation, but not with his power.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  In the later days of their rule, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king defiant and skilled in dissimulation will stand up.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  His power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will utter monstrous things, and will achieve, and will destroy the mighty ones.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  His cleverness will be directed against the holy people; he will succeed through deceit, and devise great things, and he will destroy many unawares; he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be destroyed, but not by human hands.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but hide the vision for it belongs to many days to come.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for days; then I rose up and did the king’s business and I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 9]</p>

<h5>Vision of the seventy weeks</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived by the books the number of years concerning which the word of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Jeremiah the prophet, that they should be completed while Jerusalem stood in ruins – namely seventy years.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I turned my face to the Lord God, to apply myself to prayer and supplication, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I prayed to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  my God, and made confession, and said, “Oh, Lord, the great and the terrible God, who keeps the covenant and shows mercy to those who serve him and keep his commands,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  we have sinned and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but shame belongs, as at this day, to the people of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel who are near, and those who are afar off, in the lands where you have driven them, because of their crimes which they have committed against you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “Lord, to us belongs shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  To the Lord our God belongs compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  neither have we obeyed the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  our God, to walk in his teachings which he set before us by his servants the prophets.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  All Israel have transgressed your law and have turned so as not to obey your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us, and the oath which is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great misfortune; for under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done as has been done to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favour of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and discern your faithfulness.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has watched over the evil and brought it upon us, for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gained renown as at this day, we have sinned and we have done wickedly.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  O Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath, I beg you, be turned away from your city, Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of reproach to all who are round about us.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Listen, our God to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and show favor to your sanctuary, which is desolate, for the sake of your servants, O Lord.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which bears your name; for we do not present our supplications before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great compassion.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and perform; defer not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing, my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  my God for the holy mountain of my God,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen earlier in the vision, being made to fly swiftly, approached me about the time of the evening offering.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He came, and talked with me, and said, “ Daniel, I have now come forth to give you wisdom and insight.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  At the beginning of your supplications the command went forth, and I have come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved; therefore heed the word, and understand the vision. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  “Seventy weeks have been decreed upon your people and upon your holy city, to make an end of the sacrilege, and to complete the sin, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the command to repeople and rebuild Jerusalem to the anointed one, the prince, will be seven weeks; sixty-two weeks will it be rebuilt, with broad places and streets. At the end of times  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  (even after the sixty-two weeks) an anointed one will be cut off without judicial trial; and the city and the sanctuary will be destroyed together, and his end will come with a flood and even to the end there will be war, a sentence of desolations.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The covenant will be annulled for many for one week; and in the midst of the week the sacrifice and the offering will cease, and in its place will be an appalling abomination and that until the ruin determined upon, is poured out upon the appalling thing.”

<h5>Vision of the kings of north and south</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a a revelation came to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, and it means great distress. He gave heed to the words, and understood the vision: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I ate no pleasant bread, neither did any meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were past.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I looked up, and there was a man clothed in linen, with a belt of pure gold of Ophir;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  his body also was like the chrysolith, and his face like lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling seized them, and they fled to hide themselves.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, for my fresh appearance was changed to pallor.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Yet when I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep trance with my face toward the ground. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “Suddenly, a hand touched me, which set me trembling upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He said to me, ‘Daniel, greatly beloved, give heed to the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for to you have I now been sent.’ When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then he said to me, ‘Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to gain insight, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the prince of the kings of Persia.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When he had said these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground, and was dumb.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then one who looked human touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him who stood before me, ‘My Lord, because of the vision my pangs have come upon me, and I retain no strength,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for how can this the servant of my Lord talk with my Lord? For as for me, henceforth there remains no strength in me, nor is there breath left in me. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  “Then another in appearance like a person touched me, and strengthened me.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He said, ‘Greatly beloved, fear not; peace be to you; be strong, be bold.’ When he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, ‘Let my Lord speak; for you have strengthened me.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then he said, ‘Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia, and when I go forth, then the prince of Greece will come;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and none who help me against these, except Michael, your prince, stand as my helper and defence. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “‘But now I will tell you what is written in the book of truth.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Three more kings will stand up for Persia; and the fourth will be far richer than them all; and when he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then a warrior king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion and do according to his will.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When he has become strong, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided to the four winds of heaven, but it will not belong to his posterity, nor will it be as great as his dominion, which he ruled, for his kingdom will be overthrown and will belong to others besides these. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “‘The king of the south will be strong, but one of his princes will be stronger than he, and will rule; his dominion will be great.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  At the end of some years they will make an alliance with one another, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but that support will not retain strength, neither will his supports stand; but she will be given up, and they who brought her, and her child, and he who supported her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “‘But in those times a shoot out of her roots will arise in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will act against them and prevail,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and also will carry away their gods, together with their molten images and their costly things of silver and gold, captive into Egypt; and he will refrain some years from the king of the north.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then another will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return to his own land. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  His son will war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, and he will come onward, and overflow, and pass through, and will return and war, even to his fortress.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The king of the south will be enraged, and the will come forth and fight with him. even with the king of the north, and that one will raise a great multitude, but the multitude will be delivered into his hands.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The multitude will be carried away, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not show himself strong. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “‘The king of the north will return, and will raise a multitude greater than the former; and he will come after a period of several years, with a great army and with much equipment.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In those times many will stand up against the king of the south, also the sons of the violent among your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they will be overthrown. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “‘So the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city; and the forces of the south will not stand, nor his chosen men, and there will be no strength to stand.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But he who will come against him, will do as he desires, and none will withstand him; and he will stand in the glorious land, and in his hand will be destruction.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, but he will make an agreement with him; and he will perform them; and he will give him the daughter of women, to ruin it; but it will not avail nor will he attain it.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  After this he will turn his face to the coast-lands, and he will take many; but a consul will put an end to the insults offered by him; and will repay his insults sevenfold.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall and will no longer be found. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “‘Then one will stand up in his place who will cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be broken, but not in anger nor in battle.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  In his place there will stand up a contemptible person upon whom they had not conferred the royal honor; but he will come unexpectedly, and will obtain the kingdom by intrigues.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Forces will be utterly overwhelmed before him and will be broken, and also a prince of the covenant.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After they make a league with him he will act deceitfully; for he will rise and become strong, with a small nation.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He will come unperceived, even into the fattest parts of a province; and he will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he will scatter among them prey and spoil and riches, and he will devise plans against the strongholds, even for a time.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He will arouse his might and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will make war with an exceedingly great army; but he will not stand, for they will devise plans against him.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Those who eat his dainties will ruin him, and his army will be swept away as a flood, and many will fall down slain.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As for these kings, their hearts will be bent on mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it will not prosper, for yet the end will be at the time appointed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “‘Then will he return to his land with great riches, and his heart will be against the holy covenant; and he will do his pleasure, and return to his own land.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  At the time appointed he will return, and enter into the south; but it will not be in the latter time as in the former;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  for ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be cowed, and will return, and vent his rage on the holy covenant, and will do his pleasure. He will return and fix his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Forces sent by him will prevail, and they will profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and will take away the daily offering and set up the appalling abomination.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  He will pervert by specious promises, those who bring guilt upon the covenant; but the people who know their God will be valiant and do exploits. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “‘They who are wise among the people will give understanding to many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil many days.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Now when they are falling, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with false protestations.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Some of those who are wise will fall, in order to refine them and cleanse them and make them white, until the time of the end, for it is yet for the time appointed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “‘The king will do according to his will; and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until God’s wrath be exhausted; for that which is decreed will be done.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Neither will he regard the gods of his fathers; nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he will magnify himself above all.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  But in his place will he honor a god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not will he honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly things.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  He will procure for the strong fortresses the people of a foreign god. Whomsoever he regards with favor he will raise to great honor, and he will make them to rule over many, and he will divide the land for a price. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  “‘At the time of the end the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into the countries, and he will overflow them and pass through.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  He will enter also into the glorious land, and many thousands will fall; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the remnant of the Ammonites.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  He will stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  He will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and Ethiopians will follow in his train.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  But rumors out of the east and north will trouble him; and he will go forth with great fury to destroy and to utterly exterminate many.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  He will plant his palace between the Mediterranean and the glorious holy mountain; so he will come to his end, and none will help him. 

<p class="c-num">[Daniel 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “‘At that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of my people; and there will be a time of affliction such as there never was since there was a nation, even to that time; and at that time your people will be delivered, every one who will be found written in the loyal book.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They who are wise will shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But thou, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, to the time of the end; many will run to and fro and knowledge will be increased.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others were standing, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on the other side.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, ‘How long will it be to the end of these marvels?’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, and he lifted up his right and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever: ‘It will be for a time, times, and a half; and when the power of the shatterer of the holy people will come to an end all these things will be finished.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I heard but I understood not. Then I said, ‘My lord, what will be the end of these things?’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He said, ‘Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Many will cleanse themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but they who are wise will understand.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  From the time that the daily sacrifice will be taken away, and the appalling abomination set up will be twelve hundred and ninety days.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty-five days.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But go your way to the end. You will take your rest and stand up to receive your lot at the end of the days.’”

<h2>The Book of</h2>

<h1>Hosea</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Hosea 1]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> 

<p> The word of Jehovah to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Aiiaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> 

<p> Now Jehovah said to Hosea: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Go marry a wife with whorish instincts  

<p class="indent-2"> who will bear you children by her whoredom, 

<p class="indent-1"> For the land is continually going a-whoring from after Jehovah. 

<p class="indent-2"> So he went and married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam. 

<p> And when she conceived and bore him a son,   <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jehovah said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Call his name <<Jezreel,>> 

<p class="indent-1"> For yet a little while 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will avenge the blood shed at Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And it shall come to pass in that day, 

<p class="indent-1"> That I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Call her name <<Unpitied,>> 

<p class="indent-2"> For I will no longer 

<p class="indent-1"> Have pity on the house of Israel. 

<p class="indent-1"> That I should still spare them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Then she weaned Unpitied; and when she conceived and bore a son, he  said:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> Call his name, <<Not-my-people:>> 

<p class="indent-1"> For ye indeed are not my people, 

<p class="indent-1"> And I indeed am not your God. 

<p> Then Hosea said:  

<p><p class="indent-1"><i> I will put away Gomer, </i>

<p class="indent-1"> For she is not my wife,  

<p class="indent-1"> And I will not be her husband; 

<p class="indent-1"> And on her children I will have no pity, 

<p class="indent-1"> Since they are children of whoredom, 

<p class="indent-1"> For their mother hath become a harlot,  She who conceived them hath behaved shamefully. 

<p class="c-num">[Hosea 3 ]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But Jehovah said to me: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Still go, love this woman, 

<p class="indent-1"> Who loves a paramour and is an adulteress, 

<p class="indent-1"> As Jehovah loveth the Israelites, 

<p class="indent-1"> Although they turn to other gods, 

<p class="indent-1"> And love raisin-cakes. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and eight bushels of barley and a measure of barley. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And I said to her: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Many days shalt thou abide for me, 

<p class="indent-1"> Thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife,  

<p class="indent-1"> Yet, I, on my part will be thine.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> For through many days 

<p class="indent-1"> The Israelites shall abide 

<p class="indent-1"> Without king and without prince,  

<p class="indent-1"> Without sacrifice and without pillar, 

<p class="indent-1"> Without ephod and without teraphim.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span> 

<p> Afterward the Israelites shall return, and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. and they shall come trembling to Jehovah and his goodness, at the end of days. 

<p class="c-num">[Hosea 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Strive with your mother, strive, 

<p class="indent-1"> That she put her acts of whoredom from her sight, 

<p class="indent-1"> And her adulteries from between her breasts, 

<p class="indent-1"> Lest I strip her naked, 

<p class="indent-1"> And set her as she was on the day of her birth, 

<p class="indent-1"> And make her like the wilderness, 

<p class="indent-1"> And let her become like a parched land, 

<p class="indent-1"> And let her die of thirst. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For she hath said, 

<p><p class="indent-1"> I will go after my paramour 

<p class="indent-1"> Who gave me my bread and my water, 

<p class="indent-1"> My wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> Therefore I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns,  

<p class="indent-1"> And build a wall about her,  

<p class="indent-1"> So that she cannot find her paths.   <span class="v-num">[7]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And she will pursue her paramours, 

<p class="indent-1"> But will not overtake them,  

<p class="indent-1"> And she will seek and not find them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> But she herself did not know  

<p class="indent-1"> That it was I who gave her  

<p class="indent-1"> The corn, the sweet wine, and the oil.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> Therefore I will take back my corn in its time, 

<p class="indent-1"> And my sweet wine in its season, 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will withdraw my wool and my flax, 

<p class="indent-1"> Given to cover her nakedness;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And so I will uncover her shame, 

<p class="indent-1"> And none shall deliver her out of my hand.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, 

<p class="indent-1"> Of which she bath said, <<These are my rewards 

<p class="indent-1"> Which my lovers have given me.>> 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will make them a thicket, 

<p class="indent-1"> And the wild beasts shall devour them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will also cause all her mirth to cease, 

<p class="indent-1"> Her feasts, her new moon, and her sabbaths.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And thus will I visit upon her the days of the Baalim, 

<p class="indent-1"> In which she made offerings to them, 

<p class="indent-1"> And decked herself with ear-rings and jewels, 

<p class="indent-1"> And went after her paramours, 

<p class="indent-1"> And forgot me, is the oracle of Jehovah.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> Therefore I am going to allure her, 

<p class="indent-1"> And bring her into the wilderness, 

<p class="indent-1"> And speak endearingly to her.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will give her from there her vineyards, 

<p class="indent-1"> And the valley of Achori as a door of hope, 

<p class="indent-1"> And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth, 

<p class="indent-1"> As in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span> 

<p class="indent-1"> And it shall be in that day, is the oracle of Jehovah,

He shall blossom as the lily,  And he shall strike in his roots like Lebanon.r And his saplings shall spread out,  ’And his beauty shall be like that of the olive tree .°  ’They shall return and dwellt in my shadow,  And they shall live well-watered liken a garden.  And they shall sprout like the vine;  Their renown shall be like that of the wine of Lebanon.  ’Ephraim—what more has hey to do with idols!  It is I Jehovah who respond to him and look after him, I am like an ever green cypress;"’  From me is thy fruit found.  Whoever is wise, let him discern these things,  Prudent, let him perceive them; For Jehovah’s ways are straight,  And the righteous walk in them, But the wicked stumble in them..  106

What is your country and to what people do you belong?”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He replied, “I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, “What have you done?” For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , because he had told them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So they cried to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and said, “We beg you,  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ; you have done as it pleases you.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then the men greatly feared the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights. 

<h5>Jonah’s song</h5>

<p class="c-num">[Jonah 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jonah prayed to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  his God, out of the belly of the fish,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and said:

<p class="indent-2"> and he answered me;

<p class="c-num">[Jonah 3]</p>

<h5>The message to Nineveh</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  This message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Jonah the second time,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Jonah started for Nineveh, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  commanded. Now Nineveh was so large a city that it took three days’ journey to cross it.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, and he proclaimed, “Forty days more and Nineveh shall be overthrown.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And when word came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And he made this proclamation and published it in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: People, beast, herd, and flock shall not taste anything; let them not eat nor drink water.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and from the deeds of violence which they are doing.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Who knows? God may relent and avert his fierce anger, so that we may not die.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When God saw that they turned from their evil course, he relented the evil which he said he would do to them, and did not do it. 

<p class="c-num">[Jonah 4]</p>

<h5>Jonah sulks</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He prayed to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and said, “Ah,  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , wasn’t this what I said when I was still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and ready to forgive.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Therefore,  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , I beg you, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live!”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “Are you doing right in being angry?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would become of the city.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  arranged for a bush to grow up over Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave Jonah great pleasure;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah’s head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But God said to Jonah, “Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?” He replied, “I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!” 

<h5>Jonah is rebuked</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in a night.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left; and many cattle too?”

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, this message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: 

<p class="indent-1"> The people say that the time has not yet come to rebuild the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then this message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai the prophet: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your own well-roofed houses,

<p class="indent-1"> The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says:

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, with all the rest of the people, obeyed the command of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  their God had sent him to them.

<h5>Former displeasure and the new promise of blessings</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, this message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai the prophet:  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: “Ask the priests for a ruling:  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  ‘If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with that garment touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy?’” 

<p> And the priests answered: “No.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then said Haggai, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?” 

<p> And the priests answered: “It would be unclean.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Haggai replied: “So is this people and so is this nation before me, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  declares, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Think back from this day, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  How were you? When you came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, there were only ten; when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were only twenty.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  ‘I struck all the work of your hands with blasting and blight, with mildew and with hail. Yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  ‘Think back from this day, think!

<h5>Zerubbabel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  This message from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:

<h5>The Lesson from the Past</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was furious with your ancestors.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So tell the people this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts: “Return to me,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “and I will return to you” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, ‘The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says to turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds’. They did not heed nor listen to me,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But did not my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors?

<h5>The Lord’s Jealous Love for Zion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I saw in the night a man on a red horse, among the myrtle trees that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then said I, “My Lord, what are these?” And the messenger who was talking with me said, “I will show you what they are.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  has sent to patrol the earth.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And the riders answered the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the earth is still and at peace.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said, “ <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, how long will you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you have been angry for seventy years?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  answered the messenger who was talking with me with kind and comforting words.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So the messenger who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim now that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But I am deeply angry with the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel but they made the suffering worse.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , I am turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Proclaim again: Thus says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.” 

<h5>Destruction of the Heathen Powers</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now I looked up and saw four horns.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I said to the messenger who was talking with me, “What are these?” He answered, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  showed me four smiths.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I said, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared lift their head.

<h5>Promise that Jerusalem Will be Gloriously Restored</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I said, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and length.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the messenger who talked with me stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and said to him, “Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will live there.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For I, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.

<h5>Purification of the Priesthood and Nation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to the Adversary, “May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  rebuke you, Adversary! The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The messenger said to those who stood before him, “Take off his filthy garments.” Then to Joshua he said, “I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And he ordered: “Set a clean turban upon his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  was standing by. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  testified to Joshua:  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: “If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access among these that stand by.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  On that day,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “you will each invite your neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.”

<h5>The Supporters of the Temple Service</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as someone who is woken from sleep.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on its top,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on its left side.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the messenger who talked with me answered, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said. “No, my lord.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He said to me, “This is the message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  regarding Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, ‘Grace, grace, to it.’”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Moreover this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to me:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me to you.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are the eyes of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  that search all around the world.)  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Again I asked, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on its left side?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Again, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  He answered me, “Don’t you now what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then he explained, “They are the two anointed ones who attend the Lord of all the earth.” 

<p class="c-num">[Zechariah 5]</p>

<h5>The Flying Scroll</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath shall be banished according to the writing on the other side.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I have sent it out, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.” 

<h5>The Woman in an Ephah</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Look up and see what is now coming.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I said. “What is it?” He said, “It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He said, “This is Wickedness.” He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.” 

<p class="c-num">[Zechariah 6]</p>

<h5>The War-Chariots of the Lord</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The messenger answered me, “These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of all the earth.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The black horses are going toward the north country and the white toward the west and the dappled toward the south country.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, “Go, patrol the earth,” and they did so.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then he cried out to me, “The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.” 

<h5>Preparations for the Crowning of Zerubbabel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to me:  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Tell him: “Thus says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honor due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  People from far away will come and build in the temple of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and you will know that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God.” 

<p class="c-num">[Zechariah 7]</p>

<h5>The Lord’s Real Demands</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  came to Zechariah.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favor of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and to ask the priests of the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and the prophets “Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts came to me:  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Tell all the people of the land and the priests, “When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Wasn’t it this which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  proclaimed by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  gave this message to Zechariah:  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says, execute true judgments. Show kindness and mercy to each other.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident alien or the poor. Let none of you devise evil against another in your hearts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears so they wouldn’t hear.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They made their hearts as hard as stone so they wouldn’t accept the teaching and the words that the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great was the anger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts:  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I called and they would not hear, so they call and I do not hear, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I scattered them by a whirlwind out among nations unknown to them. The land was left desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made the pleasant land a desolation.

<h5>Promises that the Scattered Exiles Will Return and the Lord’s Rule be Widely Acknowledged</h5>

No one could go out or return safe from enemies, because I set each against their neighbor.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But now I will treat the remnant of the people differently from former days, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Peace will be sown.

Render peaceful decisions in your gates.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Let none of you devise evil in your heart against one another. Do not love perjury. All these are things I hate, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And this message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts came to me:  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be festivals of joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore love truth and peace. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: Peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will come,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, “Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and to seek the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts; I will go also.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, “We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”

<h5>Fate of Judah’s Traitorous Rulers and the Ultimate Deliverance</h5>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Open your doors, Lebanon, 

<p class="indent-1"> so that fire may devour your cedars. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Wail, pine-tree, for the cedar is fallen. 

<p class="indent-1"> Wail, oaks of Bashan, 

<p class="indent-1"> for the inaccessible forest has fallen. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Listen to the wailing of the shepherds! 

<p class="indent-1"> Their glory is destroyed. 

<p class="indent-1"> Listen to the roaring of young lions! 

<p class="indent-1"> Blasted is the thick forest of the Jordan. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The people who sell them say, Blessed be the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , for I am rich! And their own shepherds have no compassion for them.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I will no longer have pity on the people of this earth, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . I will turn neighbor against neighbor, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land is devastated I will not rescue them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So I shepherded the flock of slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I set aside three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them, and they also were displeased at me.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I said, I will not shepherd you. What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And let those who are left devour one another’s flesh.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And I took my staff, Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me knew that it was the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s message.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don’t.” So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to me, Cast it into the treasury – the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , into the treasury. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  said to me: Take again the implements of a worthless shepherd.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For I am about to appoint a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit. Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will devour and even their hoofs he will tear. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! 

<p class="indent-1"> May the sword strike his arm and his right eye.

<h5>Jerusalem’s Deliverance from Heathen Attack</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  An oracle. This is the message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  about Israel. The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the human spirit within people says:

<h5>The Judgment upon the Heathen and the Exaltation of the Lord</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A day is coming for the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , when your plundered possessions will be divided while you watch.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And all the nations will gather to Jerusalem, to fight against it. The city will be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go into captivity, and the rest of the people left in the ruins.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will go forth and fight against these nations, as once he fought in the day of battle.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, (which is opposite Jerusalem, on the east). The Mount of Olives will be split into halves, from east to west, by an exceedingly great valley; and half of the mountain will slide northwards and half southwards.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  You will escape through my valley – the valley between the hills will extend as far as Azel, and you will flee as you fled from before the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. But the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  your God will come, and all the holy ones with him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And in that day, there will be no heat nor cold nor frost,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but it will be constant day – it is known to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  – with neither day nor night. Even at evening time there will be light.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And on that day living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; in both summer and winter.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will be king over all the earth. On that day the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will be one, and his name one.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The land will be changed to plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem will be high and inhabited as it stands, from the Benjamin Gate up to the place of the first gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate, and as far as the king’s winepresses.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Jerusalem will be inhabited, for never again will it be doomed to destruction, and its people will abide in security. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  This is the plague with which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will strike all the peoples who array themselves against Jerusalem: he will make their flesh rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouth.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On that day a great panic sent by the Lord will fall on them. Everyone will seize their neighbours and attack them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up – gold and silver and piles of clothing.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Plague will fall upon the horses, mules, camels, and asses, and on all the animals in all those camps. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  All who are left of all the nations which fought against Jerusalem will come up from year to year to worship the King, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and to keep the pilgrim-feast of tabernacles.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Whoever of all the peoples of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, on them there will be no rain.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If the family of Egypt does not go up nor enter in, on them also will come the plague with which the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will strike the nations.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all nations which do not come up to keep the feast of the tabernacles. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  On that day there will be inscribed upon the bells of the horses, ‘Holy to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’ and the pots in the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  will be as holy as the sacrificial bowls before the altars.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and cook the sacrifices in them. There will be no more traffickers in the house of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts in that day.

<p class="c-num">[Malachi 1]</p>

<h5>The Lord’s Love for Israel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  An oracle. The message of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to Israel through Malachi. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “I have loved you,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . “But you ask, ‘How have you shown love to us?’ Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” explains the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “yet I loved Jacob,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  but hated Esau, and made his mountains a desolation, and transformed his ancestral land into a wilderness.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When Edom says, ‘We are beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the ruined places’” the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says, “They may build, but I will throw down. They will be called, ‘The border land of wickedness,’ the people against whom the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is angry forever.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Your own eyes will see this, and you will say, ‘the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> ’s greatness reaches beyond the border of Israel.’”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> 

<h5>Against the Priests</h5>

<p> “A son honors his father and servant their master. If I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the one who fears me? So says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  to you, priests who despise my name. You ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You offer on my altar bread that is polluted. You ask, ‘How have we polluted it?’ Because you say, ‘The table of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is contemptible.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When you offer the blind animal for sacrifice, ‘It doesn’t matter!’ And when you offer the lame and the sick ‘It doesn’t matter!’ Give an animal like that to your governor; will he be pleased with it? Will he receive you favorably?” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now, plead for the favor of God with such an offering, so that he may be gracious to us. “Would I receive any of you favorably?” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “If only one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you could not kindle useless fires on my altar! I have no pleasure in you,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “Nor will I accept an offering from your hand.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place they offer to my name a pure offering. For my name is great among the nations,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “But you profane me when you say, ‘The table of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is polluted, and its food is contemptible.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You say also, ‘How tired we are of all this!’ and you sniff contemptuously at it. You have brought the blind, the lame and the sick as offerings. Should I accept this from your hand?” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “Cursed be the cheat, who has in his flock a valuable male, but vows and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished animal! For I am a great king,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “and my name is feared among the nations.” 

<p class="c-num">[Malachi 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “Now, you priests, this command is for you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If you will not hear, and if you do not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “Then I will lay a curse on you. I will turn your blessings into curses. Indeed I have already done so, because you pay no attention.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I will punish your descendants! I will spread offal upon your faces, even the offal of your pilgrim feasts, you will be discarded.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  You will then know that I have sent this command to you, so that my covenant with Levi may be preserved,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “My covenant with him was to give life and peace. I gave them to him so that he might revere me. He revered me, and stood in awe of my name.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The true instruction was in his mouth, and injustice was not found in his lips; He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “But you have turned aside from that way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “So I have I made you contemptible and degraded before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had no respect for me in imparting the law.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> 

<h5>Unfaithfulness</h5>

<p> Don’t we have all one father? Didn’t one God created us? Why do we deal faithlessly with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Judah is treacherous, and abominations are committed in Israel and in Jerusalem because Judah has profaned the holy things loved by the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  May the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  banish from the community of Jacob anyone who does this, anyone awaking, testifying, and making an offering to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And you also do this: You cover the altar of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  with tears, because he doesn’t accept the offering any more, doesn’t accept it from your hand.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Yet you ask, “Why?” Because the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young. You have been unfaithful to her, even though she is your companion, and your legal wife. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Did not the one God make everyone, so that all both flesh and spirit is his? And what does that one God seek but godly children? Therefore keep watch over your spirit, and let none of you deal faithlessly with the wife of your youth.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “A man who divorces or puts away his wife,” says  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , the God of Israel, “overwhelms her with cruelty.” The  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: “Keep watch over your spirit, do not be unfaithful.” 

<h5>The Lord’s Coming Judgment</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  You have wearied the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  with your words. You ask, “How have we wearied him?” By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , and he delights in them.” Or, “Where is the God of justice?” 

<p class="c-num">[Malachi 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “I am about to send my messenger and he will clear a path before me: And the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , who you are seeking, will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant who you long for is already coming, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand firm when he appears? He is like a refiner’s fire, and like a launderer’s soap,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and he will sit as a refiner and purifier. He will purify the descendants of Levi, and refine them like gold and silver, until they are fit to bring offerings to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> .  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then will the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , as in the days of old, and as in former years. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against the sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who cheat workers, or widows, or orphans, deny justice to immigrants, and do not fear me,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “For I, the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> , do not change; and you have not ceased to be descendants of Jacob.” 

<h5>Paying the Tithe</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “From the days of your ancestors, you have turned aside from my statutes, and you have not kept them. Turn to me and I will turn to you,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . “You say, ‘How should we turn?’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Can a human rob God? Yet you robbed me. You ask, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and gifts!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You – your entire nation – are all cursed, because you rob me. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there is food in my house. Test me in this way. See if I will not open to you the windows of the sky, and pour you out a blessing, until there is more than enough.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I will rebuke for your sakes the devouring locust and he will not destroy your crops, nor will the vine fail to ripen its fruit in the field, says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and all nations will call you happy, for you will be a delightful land,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span> 

<h5>Future Reward of the Godless and Faithful</h5>

<p> “You have said terrible things about me,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span> . “You ask, ‘What have we said about you?’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God, and what do we gain from the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts by keeping his commands, and walking mournfully in funeral garb before him?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So now we call the proud happy, evildoers thrive: they dare God and escape unharmed.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Such things those who revered the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  spoke to one another, and the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  took notice, and a record was written before him of those who revered the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  and those who keep in mind his name.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “They will be mine,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “my special possession on that day that I am preparing. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Once again my people will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the person who serves God and the person who does not.” 

<p class="c-num">[Malachi 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “The day is coming that will burn like a furnace, and all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble, and the day that is coming will burn them up,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “leaving neither root nor branch.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But to you who revere my name there will arise the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings, and you will run free like calves let out from their stall.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In the day when I act you will tread down the wicked, they will be as ashes under the soles of your feet,” says the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Remember the law of Moses my servant, statutes and judgments which I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I am about to send to you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of the  <span class="tetragrammaton"> Lord </span>  comes.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He will turn fathers’ hearts to their sons and sons’ hearts to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgement.”

<h5>The Birth, Parentage and Infancy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  A genealogy of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his brothers,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez of Hezron, Hezron of Aram,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Aram of Aminadab, Aminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed of Jesse,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jesse of David the King. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah’s widow,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of Joram, Joram of Uzziah,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of Hezekiah,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Josiah of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  After the Exile to Babylon – Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, Salathiel of Zerubbabel,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim, Achim of Eliud,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Eliud of Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan, Matthan of Jacob,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called ‘Christ’.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This is how Jesus Christ was born: 

<p> His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. 

<p> “Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  All this happened in fulfillment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  ‘The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> – a word which means ‘God is with us.’  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 2]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer, “for it is said in the prophet – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  ‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land, 

<p class="indent-2"> are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah, 

<p class="indent-1"> for out of you will come a ruler – 

<p class="indent-2"> who will shepherd my people Israel.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  At the sight of the star they were filled with joy.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But afterward, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and there he stayed until Herod’s death; in fulfillment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, 

<p class="indent-2"> weeping and mourning loudly; 

<p class="indent-1"> Rachel, weeping for her children, 

<p class="indent-2"> refusing all comfort for they were dead.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfillment of these words in the prophets – ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 3]</p>

<h5>The Preparation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 

<p class="indent-1"> “Make ready the way of the Lord, 

<p class="indent-1"> make his paths straight.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Let your life, then, prove your repentance;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But John tried to prevent him. 

<p> “I need to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “This is the way it should be for now,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “because we should do everything that God requires.” </span>  So John agreed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and from the heavens there came a voice which said, “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.” 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 4]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The Tempter came to him, and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘He will give his angels commands about you, 

<p class="indent-1"> and on their hands they will lift you up, 

<p class="indent-1"> so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.’” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “Scripture also says,” </span>  answered Jesus, 

<p><p class="indent-1"><span class="woc"> “‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, said to him: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Go away, Satan! For scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him. 

<h5>The Work in Galilee</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Afterward, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  ‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 

<p class="indent-1"> the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan, 

<p class="indent-2"> with Galilee of the Gentiles – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The people who were living in darkness 

<p class="indent-2"> have seen a great light, 

<p class="indent-1"> and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death, 

<p class="indent-2"> a light has dawned!’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  At that time Jesus began to proclaim – 

<p><p class="indent-1"><span class="woc"> “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers – Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew – casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “Come and follow me,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “and I will teach you to fish for people.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The two men left their nets at once and followed him.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain – any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralyzed; and he cured them.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and he began to teach them, saying: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Blessed are the poor in spirit, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are the mourners, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will be comforted. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are the gentle, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will inherit the earth. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will be satisfied. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are the merciful, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will find mercy. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are the pure in heart, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will see God. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are the peacemakers, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for they will be called children of God. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, </span>

<p class="indent-2"><span class="woc"> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “Blessed are you when people insult you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> Be glad and rejoice, because your reward in heaven will be great; this is the way they persecuted the prophets who lived before you. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> “You are salt for the world. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown away, and trampled underfoot. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> It is you who are the light of the world. A town that stands on a hill cannot be hidden. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp-stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> Let your light so shine before the eyes of others so that, seeing your good actions, they will praise your Father who is in heaven. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the Law until all is done. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments, even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least esteemed in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches others to do so, will be esteemed great in the kingdom of heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Indeed I tell you that, unless you obey God’s commands better than of the teachers of the Law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “You have heard that to our ancestors it was said – ‘You must not commit murder,’ and ‘Whoever commits murder will be brought to trial.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> But I say to you that anyone who is angry at their brother or sister will be brought to trial; and whoever insults their brother or sister will be brought before the High Council, while whoever calls them a fool will be in danger of the fires of Gehenna. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore, when presenting your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> leave your gift there, before the altar, go and be reconciled to them, first, then come and present your gift. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet them on your way to the court; otherwise they might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the judicial officer, and you will be thrown into prison. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the last cent. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “I am willing; become clean.” </span>  Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and then Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “Sir,” he said, “my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “I will come and cure him,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “Sir,” the captain went on, “I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him,  <span class="woc"> “Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this! </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> while the heirs to the kingdom will be banished into the darkness outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Jesus said to the captain,  <span class="woc"> “Go now, and it will be according to your faith.” </span>  And the man was cured that very hour. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – ‘He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “Foxes have holes,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “Master,” said another, who was a disciple, “let me first go and bury my father.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why are you so timid?” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “You of little faith!” </span>  Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The men were amazed, and exclaimed, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Suddenly they shrieked out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go,” </span>  he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Afterward Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.” </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “Why do your cherish such wicked thoughts? </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> Which, I ask, is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’? </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> But to show you that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” </span>  – then he said to the paralyzed man –  <span class="woc"> “Get up, take up your bed, and return to your home.” </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The man got up and went to his home.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span>  Matthew got up and followed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax-gatherers and outcasts?”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On hearing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Go and learn what this means – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice’; for I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Can the groom’s friends mourn as long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> Nobody ever puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for such a patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Nor do people put new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the skins burst, and the wine runs out, and the skins are lost; but they put new wine into fresh skins, and so both are preserved.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. “My daughter,” he said, “has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “If I only touch his cloak,” she said to herself, “I will get well.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Turning and seeing her, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.” </span>  And at that very moment she became well.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When Jesus reached the leader’s house, seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.” </span>  They began to laugh at him;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The report of this spread through all that part of the country. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, “Take pity on us, Son of David!”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them,  <span class="woc"> “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” </span>  “Yes, Master!” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then he touched their eyes, and said,  <span class="woc"> “It will be according to your faith.” </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them.  <span class="woc"> “See that no one knows of it,” </span>  he said.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But the Pharisees said, “He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Jesus went around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send laborers to gather in his harvest.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 10]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The names of the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gather; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot – the apostle who betrayed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them these instructions –  <span class="woc"> “Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any Samaritan town, </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> On your way proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have received free of cost, give free of cost. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not provide yourselves with gold, or silver, or coins in your purses; </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> not even with a bag for the journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals, or even a staff; for the worker is worth his food. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Whatever town or village you visit, find out who is worthy in that place, and remain there until you leave. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> As you enter the house, greet it. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Then, if the house is worthy, let your blessing rest on it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return on yourselves. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in the day of judgment than the doom of that town. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes, and as blameless as doves. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Be on your guard against others, for they will betray you to courts of law, and scourge you in their synagogues; </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake so that you may witness for me before them and the nations. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Whenever they betray you, do not be anxious as to how you will speak or what you will say, for what you will say will be given you at the moment; </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> for it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> It is enough for a student to be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not become known. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> Are not two sparrows sold for a one copper coin? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> While as for you, even the hairs of your head are numbered. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not, therefore, be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone, therefore, who will publicly acknowledge me, I, too, will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> but, if anyone publicly disowns me, I, too, will disown him before my Father who is in heaven. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come to bring, not peace, but the sword. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> For I have come to set – a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> A person’s enemies will be the members of their own household. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> Anyone who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Anyone who does not take their cross and follow in my steps is not worthy of me. </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who has found their life will lose it, while the person who, for my sake, has lost their life will find it. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> “Anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who welcomes a prophet, because they are a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward; and anyone who welcomes a good person, because they are a good person, will receive a good person’s reward. </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if anyone gives but a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because they are a disciple, I tell you that they will assuredly not lose their reward.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and asked – “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The answer of Jesus to the question was –  <span class="woc"> “Go and report to John what you hear and see – </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  While John’s disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings! </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> This is the man of whom scripture says – ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> For the teaching of all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John; </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> and – if you are ready to accept it – John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> If you have ears, listen. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates – </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said ‘He has a demon in him’; </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts!’ And yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  At that same time Jesus uttered the words,  <span class="woc"> “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the child-like! </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest! </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls; </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat and eat them.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Haven’t you read,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what David did, when he and his companions were hungry – </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> how he went into the house of God, and how they ate the consecrated bread, through it was not allowable for him or his companions to eat it, but only for the priests? </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> And haven’t you read in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priest in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are not guilty? </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Here, however, I tell you, there is something greater than the Temple! </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Had you learned the meaning of the words – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned those who are not guilty. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and there he saw a man with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable to work a cure on the Sabbath – so that they might have a charge to bring against him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Which of you, if he had only one sheep, and that sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not lay hold of it and pull it out? </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> How much more precious a person is than a sheep! Therefore it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then he said to the man.  <span class="woc"> “Stretch out your hand.” </span>  The man stretched it out; and it had become as sound as the other.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  On coming out, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus, to put him to death. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place. A number of people followed him, and he cured them all;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  but he warned them not to make him known,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah –  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  ‘Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment to the Gentiles.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment to a victorious issue,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and on his name will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both talked and saw.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  At this all the people were astounded. “Is it possible that this is the son of David?” they exclaimed.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But the Pharisees heard of it and said, “He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the chief of the demons.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in their minds, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Any kingdom divided against itself becomes a desolation, and any town or household divided against itself will not last. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> So, if Satan drives Satan out, he must be divided against himself; and how, then, can his kingdom last? </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> But, if it is by the help of the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> How, again, can anyone get into a strong man’s house and carry off his goods, without first securing him? Not until then will he plunder his house. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> Anyone who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and slander; but slander against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the present age, or in the age to come. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “You must assume either that both tree and fruit are good, or that both tree and fruit are worthless; since it is by its fruits that a tree is known. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> You children of snakes! How can you, evil as you are, say anything good? For what fills the heart will rise to the lips. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> A good person, from his good stores, produces good things; while an evil person, from his evil stores, produces evil things. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that for every careless thing that people say, they must answer on the ‘day of judgment.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> For it is by your words that you will be acquitted, and by your words that you will be condemned.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  At this point, some teachers of the Law and Pharisees spoke up. “Teacher,” they said, “we want to see some sign from you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is a wicked and unfaithful generation,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that is asking for a sign, and no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> For, just as Jonah was inside the sea-monster three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> At the judgment, the people of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the present generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> No sooner does a foul spirit leave a person, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest, and does not find it. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> Then it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’; but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, and swept, and put in order. </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that man proves to be worse than the first. So, too, will it be with this wicked generation.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Someone told him this, and Jesus replied,  <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?” </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Then, stretching out his hands towards his disciples, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> For anyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  That same day, when Jesus had left the house and was sitting by the sea,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  such great crowds gathered around him, that he got into a boat, and sat in it, while all the people stood on the beach.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then he told them many truths in parables.  <span class="woc"> “The sower,” </span>  he began,  <span class="woc"> “went out to sow; and, </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> as they were sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> Some fell on rocky places, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> As soon as the sun had risen, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Some, again, fell into the brambles; but the brambles shot up and choked it. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Some, however, fell on good soil, and yielded a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Let those who have ears hear.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Afterward his disciples came to him, and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “To you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of heaven has been imparted, but not to those. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> For, to all who have, more will be given, and they will have abundance; but, from all who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> That is why I speak to them in parables, because, though they have eyes, they do not see, and though they have ears, they do not hear or understand. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> In them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You will hear with your ears without ever understanding, 

<p class="indent-2"> and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving, </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> for the mind of this nation has grown dense, 

<p class="indent-2"> and their ears are dull of hearing, 

<p class="indent-2"> their eyes also have they closed; 

<p class="indent-1"> Otherwise some day they might perceive with their eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> and with their ears they might hear, 

<p class="indent-2"> and in their mind they might understand, 

<p class="indent-2"> and might turn – 

<p class="indent-1"> and I might heal them.’ </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear; </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> for I tell you that many prophets and good people have longed for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never saw them, and to hear the things which you are hearing, yet never heard them. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen, then, yourselves to the parable of the sower. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> When anyone hears the message of the kingdom without understanding it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in their mind. This is the person meant by the seed which was sown along the path. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> By the seed which was sown on rocky places is meant the person who hears the message, and at once accepts it joyfully; </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> but, as they have no root, they stand for only a short time; and, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> By the seed which was sown among the brambles is meant the person who hears the message, but the cares of life and the glamour of wealth completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> But by the seed which was sown on the good ground is meant the person who hears the message and understands it, and really yields a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Another parable which Jesus told them was this –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is compared to a person who sowed good seed in their field. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> But, while everyone was asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> So, when the blades of corn shot up, and came into ear, the weeds made their appearance also. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> The owner’s servants came to them, and said ‘Was not it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where, then, do the weeds in it come from?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘An enemy has done this,’ was the owner’s answer. ‘Do you wish us, then,’ they asked, ‘to go and gather them together?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘No,’ said he, ‘because while you are pulling up the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> Let both grow side by side until harvest; and then I will say to the reapers, Gather the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles for burning; but bring all the wheat into my barn.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Another parable which he told them was this –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his field. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> This seed is smaller than all other seeds, but, when it has grown up, it is larger than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that ‘the wild birds come and roost in its branches.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  This was another parable which Jesus related –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.” </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Of all this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all except in parables,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  in fulfillment of these words in the prophet – ‘I will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then Jesus left the crowd, and went into the house. Presently his disciples came to him, and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  He answered,  <span class="woc"> “The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> The field is the world. By the good seed is meant the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the wicked, </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest time is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> And, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so it will be at the close of the age. </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all that hinders and those who live in sin, </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> Then will the righteous shine, like the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. If you have ears, listen. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person found and hid again, and then, in their delight, went and sold everything that they had, and bought that field. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of choice pearls. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> Finding one of great value, they went and sold everything that they had, and bought it. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was cast into the sea, and caught fish of all kinds. </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> When it was full, they hauled it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless ones away. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> So will it be at the close of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous, </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> “Have you understood all this?” </span>  Jesus asked. “Yes,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  Then he added,  <span class="woc"> “So every teacher of the Law, who has received instruction about the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who produces from his stores things both new and old.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this wisdom?” they said, “and the miracles?  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  Isn’t he the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  And his sisters, too – are not they all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?”  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  These things proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.” </span> <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 14]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and said to his attendants, “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He had John beheaded in the prison  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can to the villages, and buy themselves food.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.” </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “We have nothing here,” they said, “except five loaves and two fish.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “Bring them here to me,” </span>  was his reply.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Immediately afterward Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The boat was by this time some miles from shore, laboring in the waves, for the wind was against her.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But Jesus at once spoke to them.  <span class="woc"> “Courage!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “It is I; do not be afraid!” </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Come.” </span>  So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Master! Save me!”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him.  <span class="woc"> “You of little faith!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “Why did you falter?” </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, “You are indeed God’s Son.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  But the people of that place, recognizing Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill,  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 15]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  His reply was,  <span class="woc"> “How is it that you on your side break God’s commandments out of respect for your own traditions? </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> For God said – ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who abuses his father or mother shall suffer death,’ </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> but you say ‘Whenever anyone says to his father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for God,” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> he is in no way bound to honor his father.’ In this way you have nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you – </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘This is a people that honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me; </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then Jesus called the people to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Listen, and mark my words. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> It is not what enters a person’s mouth that defiles them, but what comes out from their mouth – that does defile them!” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  His disciples came up to him, and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> “Every plant,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> Leave them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind person guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Peter spoke up, “Explain this saying to us.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “What, do even you understand nothing yet?” </span>  Jesus exclaimed.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Don’t you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterward expelled? </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a person; </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts – murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, perjury, slander. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country around Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, “Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. “She keeps calling out after us,” they said.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “I was not sent,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, “Master, help me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is not fair,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to take the children’s food and throw it to dogs.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  “Yes, Master,” she said, “for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> “Your faith is great,” </span>  was his reply to the woman,  <span class="woc"> “it will be as you wish!” </span>  And her daughter was cured that very hour. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Afterward Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.” </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “Where can we,” his disciples asked, “in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  said Jesus. “Seven,” they answered, “and a few small fish.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 16]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “In the evening you say ‘It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> But in the morning you say ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.’ You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times! </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” </span>  So he left them and went away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Presently Jesus said to them, “Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  On noticing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith? </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Don’t you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away? </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away? </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question –  <span class="woc"> “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “Some say John the Baptist,” they answered, “Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “But you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “who do you say that I am?” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To this Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,” </span>  Jesus replied.  <span class="woc"> “For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Yes, and I say to you, your name is ‘Peter’ – a Rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. “Master,” he said, “please God that will never be your fate!”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said,  <span class="woc"> “Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as person does.” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> What good will it do a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will a person give that is of equal value with his life? </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> For the Son of Man is to come in his Father’s glory, with his angels, and then he will give to everyone what his actions deserve. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man coming into his kingdom.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 17]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shown like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Master,” exclaimed Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “Rise up, and do not be afraid.” </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning –  <span class="woc"> “Do not speak of this vision to anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “How is it,” his disciples asked, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “Elijah indeed does come,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “and will restore everything; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> and I tell you that Elijah has already come, and people have not recognized him, but have treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, too, the Son of Man is destined to undergo suffering at people’s hands.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then the disciples understood that it was of John the Baptist that he had spoken to them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the water;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Faithless and perverse generation!” </span>  Jesus exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “how long must I be among you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy here to me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy; and he was cured from that very hour.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Afterward the disciples came up to Jesus, and asked him privately, “Why was it that we could not drive it out?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “Because you have so little faith!” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “For, I tell you, if your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain ‘Move from this place to that!’ and it would be moved; and nothing would be impossible to you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into human hands, </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> and they will put him to death, but on the third day he will rise.” </span>  The disciples were greatly distressed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple-rate came up to Peter, and said, “Does not your Master pay the Temple-rate?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “Yes,” answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings take taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  “From others,” answered Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Well then,” </span>  continued Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “their sons go free. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Still, so we don’t offend them, go and throw a line into the sea; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth, and you will find in it a piece of money. Take that, and give it to the collectors for both of us.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him, “Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven at all. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore, anyone who will humble themselves like this child – that person will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even one little child like this, is welcoming me. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> But, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung around their neck. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for the world because of such temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed or lame, than to have both hands, or both feet, and be thrown into the fire that never goes out. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> Beware of despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> [Note:         Some later manuscripts add: For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> “What think you? If a person owns a hundred sheep, and one of them strays, will the person not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go and search for the one that is straying? </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if they succeed in finding it, I tell you that they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine which did not stray. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> So, too, it is the will of my Father who is in heaven that not one of these little ones should be lost. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “If your brother or sister does wrong, go to them and convince them of their fault when you are both alone. If they listen to you, you have won them over. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> But, if they do not listen to you, take with you one or two others, so that on the evidence of two or three witnesses, every word may be put beyond dispute. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> If they refuse to listen to them, speak to the church; and, if they also refuse to listen to the church, treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax-gatherer. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you, all that you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and all that you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Again, I tell you that, if but two of you on earth agree as to what they will pray for, whatever it be, it will be granted them by my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> For where two or three have come together in my name, I am present with them.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus, “Master, how often am I to forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Not seven times, but seventy times seven. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> When he had begun to do so, one of them was brought to him who owed him ten thousand bags of gold; </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> and, as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he had. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> The master was moved with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> But, on going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said ‘Pay what you owe me.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> His fellow servant threw himself on the ground and begged for mercy. ‘Have patience with me,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> But the other would not, but went and put him in prison until he should pay his debt. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and went to their master and laid the whole matter before him. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> So the master sent for the servant, and said to him ‘You wicked servant! When you begged me for mercy, I forgave you the whole of that debt. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> Shouldn’t you, also, to have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> Then his master, in anger, handed him over to the jailers, until he should pay the whole of his debt. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> So, also, will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 19]</p>

<h5>The Journey to Jerusalem</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, “Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> “Haven’t you read,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> and said – ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one’? </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.” </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “Why, then,” they said, “did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “If that,” said the disciples, “is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is not everyone,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> Some men, it is true, have from birth been disabled for marriage, while others have been disabled by their fellow men, and others again have disabled themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Accept this if you can.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Jesus, however, said,  <span class="woc"> “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  A man came up to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why ask me about goodness?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “There is but One who is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  “What commandments?” asked the man.  <span class="woc"> “These,” </span>  answered Jesus, –  <span class="woc"> “‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Honor your father and your mother.’ And ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “I have observed all these,” said the young man. “What is still wanting in me?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “If you wish to be perfect,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  At this, Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven! </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, “Who then can possibly be saved?”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But Jesus looked at them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.” </span>  Then Peter turned and said to Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  “But we – we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first. </span>

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 20]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> <span class="woc"> For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyards. </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> He agreed with the laborers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> On going out again, about nine o’clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you what is fair.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o’clock, he did as before. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them ‘Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward ‘Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Now when those who had been hired about five o’clock went up, they received two silver coins each. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each; </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> at which they began to grumble at their employer. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘These last,’ they said, ‘have done only one hour’s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day’s work, and the heat.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘My friend,’ was his reply to one of them, ‘I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me for two silver coins? </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> Don’t I have the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am liberal?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> So those who are last will be first, and the first last.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples around him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favor.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “What is it that you want?” </span>  he asked. “I want you to say,” she replied, “that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> “You do not know what you are asking,” </span>  was Jesus’ answer.  <span class="woc"> “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?” </span>  “Yes,” they exclaimed, “we can.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “You will indeed drink my cup,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “but as to a seat at my right and at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Among you it is not so. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave; </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then Jesus stopped and called them.  <span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  he said.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “Master,” they replied, “we want our eyes to be opened.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 21]</p>

<h5>The Last Days</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go to the village facing you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants them’; and he will send them at once.” </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  This happened in fulfillment of these words in the prophet –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ‘Say to the people of Zion – “Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, “God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked –  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied – “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.” </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and said to him, “Do you hear what these boys are saying?” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Yes,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but did you never read the words – ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it,  <span class="woc"> “Never again will fruit be gathered off you.” </span>  And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, “How suddenly the fig tree withered up!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’ it would be done. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “I, too,” </span>  said Jesus in reply,  <span class="woc"> “will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So the answer they gave Jesus was – “We do not know.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Then I,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said ‘Go and work in the vineyard today my son.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Yes, sir,’ he answered; but he did not go. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. ‘I will not,’ he answered; but afterward he was sorry and went. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Which of the two sons did as his father wished?” </span>  “The second,” they said.  <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  added Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that tax-gatherers and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax-gatherers and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> As a last resource he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  “Miserable wretches!” they exclaimed, “he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.”  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Then Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “Have you never read in the scriptures? – ‘The stone which the builders despised – has now itself become the corner-stone. This corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 22]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven,” he said, “may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honor of his son’s wedding. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited ‘I have prepared my breakfast, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to their farm, another to their business; </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Then he said to his servants ‘The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> So he said to him ‘My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?’ The man was speechless. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Then the king said to the attendants ‘Tie him hand and foot, and put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> For many are called, but few chosen.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.” </span>  And, when they had brought him a coin,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Whose head and title are these?” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “The Emperor’s,” they answered, at which he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, –  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “Teacher, Moses said – ‘should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.’  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The woman herself died last of all.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “Your mistake,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is due to your ignorance of the scriptures, and of the power of God. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God – </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of dead people, but of living.” </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question –  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  His answer was,  <span class="woc"> “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> This is the great first commandment. </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> The second, which is like it, is this – You must love your neighbor as you love yourself. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.” </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them –  <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” </span>  “David’s,” they said.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> “How is it, then,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him ‘lord,’ in the passage – </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet’? </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> Since, then, David calls him ‘lord,’ how is he David’s son?” </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 23]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then Jesus speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees now occupy the chair of Moses. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore practice and lay to heart everything that they tell preach but do not practice. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> While they make up heavy loads and pile them on other people’s shoulder’s they decline, themselves, to lift a finger to move them. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> All their actions are done to attract attention.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you see all these things?” </span>  was his answer.  <span class="woc"> “I tell you, not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down,” </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  so, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him privately and said, “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the close of the age.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jesus replied to them,  <span class="woc"> “See that no one leads you astray; </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> for, many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; take care not to be alarmed, for such things must occur; but the end is not yet here. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> All this, however, will be but the beginning of the birth pangs! </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> When that time comes, they will give you up to persecution, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Many false prophets, also, will appear and lead many astray; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> and, owing to the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations; and then will come the end. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> As soon, then, as you see ‘the Foul Desecration,’ mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy place,” </span>  (the reader must consider what this means)  <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains; </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> and a man on the housetop must not go down to get the things that are in his house; </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get his cloak. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Pray, too, that your flight may not take place in winter, nor on a Sabbath; </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> for that will be a time of great distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of the world down to the present time – no, nor ever will again. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> Had not those days been limited, not a single soul would escape; but for the sake of God’s people a limit will be put to them. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> At that time, if anyone should say to you ‘Look!

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 26]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his disciples,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.” </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  but they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The disciples were indignant at seeing this. “What is this waste for?” they exclaimed.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why are you troubling the woman?” </span>  Jesus said, when he noticed it.  <span class="woc"> “For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> In pouring this perfume on my body, she has done it for my burying. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and said “What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?” The Priests weighed him out thirty pieces of silver as payment.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, “Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go into the city to a certain man,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “and say to him ‘The teacher says – My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and, while they were eating, he said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that one of you will betray me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, “Can it be I, Master?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is the one who will betray me. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, “Can it be I, Rabbi?” 

<p><span class="woc"> “It is,” </span>  answered Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said,  <span class="woc"> “Take it and eat it; this is my body.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words,  <span class="woc"> “Drink from it, all of you; </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that I will never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Even you will all fall away from me tonight. Scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> But, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “If everyone else falls away from you,” Peter answered, “I will never fall away!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!” </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  “Even if I must die with you,” Peter exclaimed, “I will never disown you!” All the disciples spoke in the same way. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Sit down here while I go and pray over there.” </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am sad at heart,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer.  <span class="woc"> “My Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as you will.” </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep.  <span class="woc"> “What!” </span>  he said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “could none of you watch with me for one hour? </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.” </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed.  <span class="woc"> “My Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!” </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Then he came to the disciples, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look – my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.”  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him;  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  at which Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Friend, do what you have come for.” </span>  The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span> <span class="woc"> “Sheathe your sword,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword. </span> <span class="v-num">[53]</span> <span class="woc"> Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels? </span> <span class="v-num">[54]</span> <span class="woc"> But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?” </span> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  Jesus at the same time said to the crowds,  <span class="woc"> “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the Prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled.  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end.  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said,  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  “This man said ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”  <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”  <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[64]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.” </span> <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!  <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  What is your decision?” They answered, “He deserves death.”  <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so,  <span class="v-num">[68]</span>  “Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?”  <span class="v-num">[69]</span>  Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!”  <span class="v-num">[70]</span>  But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied.  <span class="v-num">[71]</span>  When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”  <span class="v-num">[72]</span>  Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”  <span class="v-num">[73]</span>  But soon afterward those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, “You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!”  <span class="v-num">[74]</span>  Then Peter said, “I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!” At that moment a cock crowed;  <span class="v-num">[75]</span>  and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said –  <span class="woc"> ‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’; </span>  and he went outside, and wept bitterly. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 27]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,” he said. “What has that to do with us?” they replied. “You must see to that yourself.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So, after consultation, they bought with them the ‘Potter’s Field’ for a burial-ground for foreigners;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom some of the people of Israel valued,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and gave them for the Potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked the Governor.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, “Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called ‘Christ’?”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – “Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very unhappy today in a dream because of him.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The Governor, however, said to them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?” 

<p> “Barabbas,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “What then,” Pilate asked, “should I do with Jesus who is called ‘Christ?’” “Crucify him,” they all replied.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  “Why, what harm has he done?” he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, “Crucify him!”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And all the people answered, “His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The Pilate released Barabbas to them; but Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be crucified. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison around him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene of the name of Simon; and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull),  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – ‘THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said,  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  “You who ‘destroy the Temple and build one in three days,’ save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  In the same way the chief priests, with the Teaches of the Law and elders, said in mockery,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the ‘king of Israel’! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said ‘I am God’s Son.’”  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  About three Jesus called out loudly,  <span class="woc"> “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani” </span>  – that is to say,  <span class="woc"> ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Some of those standing by heard this, and said, “The man is calling for Elijah!”  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  But the rest said, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.” [Note:         Some later manuscripts add: However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.  ] <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder,  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose,  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  The Roman captain, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, “This must indeed have been God’s Son!”  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  When evening had fallen, there came a rich man belonging to Ramah, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him.  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet,  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said,  <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  “Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said  <span class="woc"> ‘I will rise after three days.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people ‘He has risen from the dead,’ when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  “You may have a guard,” was Pilate’s reply. “Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.”  <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard. 

<p class="c-num">[Matthew 28]</p>

<h5>The Risen Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But the angel, addressing the women, said, “You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and then go quickly and say to his disciples ‘He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Remember, I have told you.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Suddenly Jesus met them.  <span class="woc"> “Welcome!” </span>  he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.” </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “And should this matter come before the Governor,” they added, “we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying,  <span class="woc"> “All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.” </span>

<h2>Good News According to</h2>

<h1>Mark</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 1]</p>

<h5>The Preparation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It is said in the prophet Isaiah – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you; 

<p class="indent-2"> he will prepare your way. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 

<p class="indent-2"> “Prepare the road for the Lord, 

<p class="indent-3"> make a straight path for him.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and he proclaimed – “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Immediately afterward the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him. 

<h5>The Work in Galilee</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God –  <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Come and follow me,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “and I will teach you to fish for people.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  They left their nets at once, and followed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But Jesus rebuked the spirit,  <span class="woc"> “Be silent! Come out from him.” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, “What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  and the whole city was gathered around the door.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, and there he began to pray.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  But Simon and his companions went out searching for him;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and, when they found him, they exclaimed, “Everyone is looking for you!”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.” </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “I am willing; become clean.” </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> “Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction. 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Being, however, unable to get him near to Jesus, owing to the crowd, they removed the roofing above Jesus; and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Child, your sins are forgiven.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were debating in their minds,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you debating in your minds about this? </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Which is easier? – to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and take up your mat, and walk’? </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth” </span>  – here he said to the paralyzed man –  <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said, “We have never seen anything like this!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span>  Levi got up and followed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When the teachers of the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with the tax-gatherers and outcasts?”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Hearing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus, “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then – when that day comes.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it – the new from the old – and a worse tear is made. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “Have you never read,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions – </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> how he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath; </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Stand out in the middle,” </span>  Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and to the people he said,  <span class="woc"> “Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Stretch out your hand.” </span>  The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, “You are the Son of God”!  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He appointed twelve – whom he also named ‘apostles’ – so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and with power to drive out demons.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So he appointed the Twelve – Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, “He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables,  <span class="woc"> “How can Satan drive out Satan? </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last; </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last – his end has come! </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> “No man who has broken into a strong man’s house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that people will be forgiven everything – their sins, and all the slanders that they utter; </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.” </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “Who is my mother? And my brothers?” </span>  was his reply.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 4]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen! The sower went out to sow; </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once; </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Afterward, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and he said,  <span class="woc"> “To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that – </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> “You do not know the meaning of this parable?” </span>  he went on,  <span class="woc"> “Then how will you understand all the other parables? </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> The sower sows the message. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these – where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully; </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message, </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand? </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> There is nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that will not be brought into the open. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Let all who have ears to hear with hear. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “Take care what you listen to,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “The standard you use will be used for you, and more will be added for you. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Jesus also said,  <span class="woc"> “This is what the kingdom of God is like – like a man who has scattered seed on the ground, </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing – he knows not how. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> The ground bears the crop of itself – first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear; </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Jesus also said,  <span class="woc"> “To what can we liken the kingdom of God? </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds, </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it;  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go across.” </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?”  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,  <span class="woc"> “Hush! Be still!” </span>  Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why are you so timid?” </span>  he exclaimed.  <span class="woc"> “Have you no faith yet?” </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?” 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  They came to the other side of the sea – the region of the Gerasenes;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  shrieking out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For Jesus had said,  <span class="woc"> “Come out from the man, you foul spirit.” </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And he asked him,  <span class="woc"> “What is your name?” </span>  “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and the spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove – about two thousand in number – rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him – and they were awe-struck.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But Jesus refused.  <span class="woc"> “Go back to your home, to your own people,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  saying, “My little daughter is at death’s door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Who touched my clothes?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  “You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say  <span class="woc"> ‘Who touched me?’” </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “Daughter,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?”  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader,  <span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid; only have faith.” </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion – people weeping and wailing incessantly.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why this confusion and weeping?” </span>  he said on entering.  <span class="woc"> “The little child is not dead; she is asleep.” </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Taking her hand, Jesus said to her,  <span class="woc"> “Talitha, koum!” </span>  – which means  <span class="woc"> ‘little girl, I am speaking to you – Rise!’ </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat. 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Isn’t he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “A prophet is not without honor, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Whenever you go to stay at a house,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “remain there until you leave that place; </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known. People were saying – “John the Baptizer must have risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Others again said – “He is Elijah,” and others – “He is a prophet, like one of the great prophets.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But when Herod heard of him, he said – “The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For John had said to Herod – “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When his daughter – that is, the daughter of Herodias – came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. “Ask me for whatever you like,” the king said to the girl, “and I will give it to you”;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him – up to half his kingdom.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The girl went out, and said to her mother “What must I ask for?” 

<p> “The head of John the Baptizer,” answered her mother.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So she went in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. “I want you,” she said, “to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> “Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and rest for a while” </span>  – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Many people saw them going, and recognized them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “It is for you to give them something to eat.” </span>  “Are we to go and spend almost a year’s wages on bread,” they asked, “to give them to eat?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Go, and see.” </span>  When they had found out, they told him, “Five, and two fish.”  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties;  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Everyone had sufficient to eat;  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Immediately afterward Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus on the shore alone.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Seeing them laboring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them.  <span class="woc"> “Courage!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “it is I; do not be afraid!” </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognizing Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  hurried over the whole country-side, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well. 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 7]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  (For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans).  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question – “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  His answer was,  <span class="woc"> “It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words – ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me; </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> You neglect God’s commandments and hold to human traditions. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Wisely do you set aside God’s commandments,” </span>  he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “to keep your own traditions! </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> For while Moses said ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,’ </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> you say ‘If a person says to their father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Corban”’ </span>  (which means ‘Set apart for God’) –  <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother! </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: Let anyone with ears to hear, listen.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “What, do even you understand so little?” </span>  exclaimed Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Don’t you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them, </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterward got rid of?” – in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is what comes out from a person,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “that defiles them, </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts – sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly; </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet –  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia – and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> “Let the children be satisfied first,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “For it is not fair to take the children’s food, and throw it to dogs.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “Yes, Master,” she replied. “Even the dogs under the table do feed on the children’s crumbs.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “For saying that,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man’s ears, and touched his tongue with saliva.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Ephphatha!” </span>  which means  <span class="woc"> ‘Be opened.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known,  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!” 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 8]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Where will it be possible,” his disciples answered, “to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  he asked. “Seven,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Immediately afterward, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Sighing deeply, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be given it.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So Jesus gave them this warning.  <span class="woc"> “Take care,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They began talking to one another about their being short of bread;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, noticing this, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Don’t you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension? </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? Don’t you remember, </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?” </span>

<p> “Twelve,” they said.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?” </span>

<p> “Seven,” they said.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “Don’t you understand now?” </span>  he repeated. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Taking the blind man’s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man’s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him,  <span class="woc"> “Do you see anything?” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The man looked up, and said, “I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man’s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Jesus sent him to his home, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Do not go even into the village.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Afterward Jesus and his disciples went into the villages around Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question –  <span class="woc"> “Who do people say that I am?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “John the Baptist,” they answered, “but others say Elijah, while others say one of the prophets.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “But you,” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “who do you say that I am?” </span>  To this Peter replied, “You are the Christ.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  At which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  He said all this quite openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Jesus, however, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Out of my sight, Satan!” </span>  he exclaimed.  <span class="woc"> “For you look at things, not as God does, but as people do.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their cross, and follow me. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will lose their life will save it. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> What good is it to a person to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> For what could a person give that is of equal value with their life? </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of them will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “that some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in power.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and his clothes became whiter than any launderer in the whole world could bleach them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Rabbi,” said Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice – “This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this ‘rising from the dead’ meant.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “How is it,” they asked Jesus, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> “Elijah does indeed come first,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised? </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “What are you arguing about with them?” </span>  Jesus asked.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “Teacher,” answered a man in the crowd, “I brought my son to see you, as he has a spirit in him that makes him mute;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “Faithless generation!” </span>  exclaimed Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “How long has he been like this?” </span>  Jesus asked the boy’s father.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “From his childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why say ‘possibly’?” </span>  Jesus replied.  <span class="woc"> “Everything is possible for one who has faith.” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The boy’s father immediately cried out, “I have faith; help my want of faith!”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit,  <span class="woc"> “Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “A spirit of this kind,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “can be driven out only by prayer.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them –  <span class="woc"> “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.” </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them,  <span class="woc"> “What were you discussing on the way?” </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.” </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking it in his arms, he said to them,  <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> “Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “None of you must prevent the man,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “for no one will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak evil of me. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> He who is not against us is for us. </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> If anyone gives you a cup of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you, he will assuredly not lose his reward. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “And, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be far better for him if he had been thrown into the sea with a great millstone around his neck. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life maimed, than to have both your hands and go into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add here or at verse 46: where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.  ] <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the life lame, than to have both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> [Note:        See the note on verse 44.  ] <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into Gehenna, </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> For it is by fire that everyone will be salted. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> Salt is good, but, if the salt should lose its saltiness, what will you use to season it? </span>

<p><span class="woc"> You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with one another.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 10]</p>

<h5>The Journey to Jerusalem</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On leaving that place, Jesus went into the district of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered about him again; and again, as usual, he began teaching them.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Presently some Pharisees came up and, to test him, asked, “Has a husband the right to divorce his wife?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “What direction did Moses give you?” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Moses,” they said, “permitted a man to draw up in writing a notice of separation and divorce his wife.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> “It was owing to the hardness of your hearts,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that Moses gave you this direction; </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> but, at the beginning of the Creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> and the man and his wife will become one;’ so that they are no longer two, but one. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> What God himself, then, has yoked together no one must separate.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When they were indoors, the disciples asked him again about this,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and he said,  <span class="woc"> “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against his wife; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> and, if the woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is guilty of adultery.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Some of the people were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who had brought them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When, however, Jesus saw this, he was indignant.  <span class="woc"> “Let the little children come to me,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, unless a person receives the kingdom of God like a child, they will not enter it at all.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then he embraced the children, and, placing his hands on them, gave them his blessing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As Jesus was resuming his journey, a man came running up to him, and threw himself on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to gain eternal life?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why do you call me good?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “No one is good but God. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> You know the commandments – ‘Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not say what is false about others. Do not cheat. Honor your father and your mother.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Teacher,” he replied, “I have observed all these from my childhood.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jesus looked at the man, and his heart went out to him, and he said,  <span class="woc"> “There is still one thing wanting in you; go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But the man’s face clouded at these words, and he went away distressed, for he had great possessions. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “How hard it will be for people of wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again,  <span class="woc"> “My children, how hard a thing it is to enter the kingdom of God! </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  “Then who can be saved?” they exclaimed in the greatest astonishment.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Jesus looked at them, and answered,  <span class="woc"> “With people it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “But we,” began Peter, “we left everything and have followed you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake and for the good news, </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> who will not receive a hundred times as much, even now in the present – houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land, though not without persecutions – and in the age that is coming, eternal life. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> But many who are first now will then be last, and the last will be first.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking in front of them. The disciples were filled with awe, while those who were following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Gathering the Twelve around him once more, Jesus began to tell them what was about to happen to him.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen!” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, and they will give him up to the Gentiles, </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> who will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him, and put him to death; and after three days he will rise again.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  he asked.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  “Grant us this,” they answered, “to sit, one on your right, and the other on your left, when you come in glory.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> “You do not know what you are asking,” </span>  Jesus said to them.  <span class="woc"> “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? Or receive the baptism that I am to receive?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “Yes,” they answered, “we can.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “You will indeed drink the cup that I am to drink,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “and receive the baptism that I am to receive, </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> but as to a seat at my right or at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  On hearing of this, the ten others were at first very indignant about James and John.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  But Jesus called the ten to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Those who are regarded as ruling among the Gentiles lord it over them, as you know, and their great men oppress them. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> But among you it is not so. No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> and whoever wants to take the first place among you must be the servant of all; </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> for even the Son of Man came, not be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  They came to Jericho. When Jesus was going out of the town with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to call out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me.”  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Many of the people kept telling him to be quiet; but the man continued to call out all the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me.”  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Then Jesus stopped.  <span class="woc"> “Call him,” </span>  he said. So they called the blind man. “Have courage!” they exclaimed. “Get up; he is calling you.”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  The man threw off his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  said Jesus, addressing him. “Rabboni,” the blind man answered, “I want to recover my sight.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span> <span class="woc"> “You may go,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Your faith has delivered you.” </span>  Immediately he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road. 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 11]</p>

<h5>The Last Days</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go to the village facing you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if anyone says to you ‘Why are you doing that?’, say ‘The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the foal?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting, “God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! God save him from on high!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and, noticing a fig-tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “May no one ever again eat of your fruit!” </span>  And his disciples heard what he said. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the Temple Courts.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then he began to teach.  <span class="woc"> “Does not scripture say,” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Now the chief priests and the teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig-tree was withered up from the roots.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then Peter recalled what had occurred. “Look, Rabbi,” he exclaimed, “the fig-tree which you doomed is withered up!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> “Have faith in God!” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you that if anyone should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> And therefore I say to you ‘Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may forgive you your offenses.” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your offenses.  ]

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders came up to him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “What authority have you to do these things?” they said. “Who gave you the authority to do them?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “I will put one question to you,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> It is about John’s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.” </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  They began arguing together. “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Yet can we say ‘human’?” They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  So their answer to Jesus was – “We do not know.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Then I,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus began to speak to them in parables,  <span class="woc"> “A man once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of the grape harvest; </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man, too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> He sent another, but him they killed; and so with many others – some they beat and some they killed. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent to them last of all. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> But those tenants said to one another ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> So they seized him, and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let the vineyard to others. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Have you never read this passage of scripture? – ‘The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone; </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> this corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they left him alone, and went away. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Afterward they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  These men came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Should we pay, or should we not pay?” Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin to look at.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And, when they had brought it, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Whose head and title are these?” </span>

<p> “The Emperor’s,” they said;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span>  And they wondered at him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Next came some Sadducees – the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “Teacher, in our scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man’s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but died and left no family;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and the second married his widow, and died without family; and so did the third.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “Is not the reason of your mistake,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “your ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God? </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> When people rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as angels in heaven. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him saying – ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “The most important,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is – ‘Hear, Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord; </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> The second is this – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  “Wisely answered, teacher!” exclaimed the teacher of the Law. “It is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other besides him;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  and to love him with all one’s heart, and with all one’s understanding, and with all one’s strength, and to love one’s neighbor as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p> After that no one ventured to question him further. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “How is it that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David’s son? </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> David himself calls him ‘lord,’ how comes it, then, that he is to be his son?” </span>

<p> The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  In the course of his teaching, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “See that you are on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect, </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at dinner. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> They are the men who rob widows of their homes, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums;  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  but one poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth very little.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests; </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> for everyone else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had – everything that she had to live on.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Mark 13]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you see these great buildings?” </span>  asked Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its close.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Jesus began,  <span class="woc"> “See that no one leads you astray. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He’, and will lead many astray. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “And, when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must occur; but the end is not yet. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning of the birth-pangs. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> “See to yourselves! They will betray you to courts of law; and you will be taken to synagogues and beaten; and you will be brought up before governors and kings for my sake, so that you can bear witness before them. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> But the good news must first be proclaimed to every nation. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Whenever they betray you and hand you over for trial, do not be anxious beforehand as to what you will say, but say whatever is given you at the moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> and you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the end will be saved. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> “As soon, however, as you see ‘the Foul Desecration’ standing where it ought not” </span>  (the reader must consider what this means)  <span class="woc"> “then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains; </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> and a person on the house-top must not go down, or go in to get anything out of their house: </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get their cloak. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> And alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Pray, too, that this may not occur in winter. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> For those days will be a time of distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of God’s creation until now – and never will again. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> And, had not the Lord put a limit to those days, not a single soul would escape; but, for the sake of God’s own chosen people, he did limit them. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “And at that time if anyone should say to you ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ ‘Look, there he is!’, do not believe it; </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and display signs and marvels, to lead astray, were it possible, even God’s people. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> But see that you are on your guard! I have told you all this beforehand. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “In those days, after that time of distress, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> the stars will be falling from the heavens, and the forces that are in the heavens will be convulsed. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory; </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> and then he will send the angels, and gather his people from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> “Learn the lesson taught by the fig-tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that he is at your doors. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> “But about that day, or the hour, no one knows – not even the angels in heaven, not even the Son – but only the Father. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “See that you are on the watch; for you do not know when the time will be. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his home, puts his servants in charge – each having their special duty – and orders the porter to watch. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Therefore watch, for you cannot be sure when the Master of the house is coming – whether in the evening, at midnight, at daybreak, or in the morning – </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> otherwise he might come suddenly and find you asleep. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> And what I say to you I say to all – Watch!” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to death;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  for they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he was sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured the perfume on his head.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Some of those who were present said to one another indignantly, “Why has the perfume been wasted like this?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  This perfume could have been sold for more than a year’s wages, and the money given to the poor.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> “Leave her alone,” </span>  said Jesus, as they began to find fault with her,  <span class="woc"> “why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has done for me. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> You always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> She has done what she could; she has perfumed my body beforehand for my burial. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> And I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They were glad to hear what he said, and promised to pay him. So he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, when it was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus, “Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the Passover?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him; </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says – Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set out ready; and there make preparations for us.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So the disciples set out and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them; and they prepared the Passover. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In the evening he went there with the Twelve,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that one of you is going to betray me – one who is eating with me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They were grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another, “Can it be I?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is one of you Twelve,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “the one who is dipping his bread beside me into the dish. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Take it; this is my body.” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “This is my covenant-blood,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “which is poured out on behalf of many. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that I will never again drink of the juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  presently Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “All of you will fall away; for scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “Even if everyone else falls away,” said Peter, “I will not.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that you yourself today – yes, this very night – before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.” </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But Peter vehemently protested, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!” And they all said the same. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples  <span class="woc"> “Sit down here while I pray.” </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am sad at heart,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “sad even to death; wait here, and watch.” </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> “Abba, Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Then he came and found the three apostles asleep.  <span class="woc"> “Simon,” </span>  he said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch for one hour? </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Watch and pray,” he said to them all, “so that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Again he went away, and prayed in the same words;  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  A third time he came, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.”  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  But Jesus spoke up, and said to the men,  <span class="woc"> “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfillment of the scriptures.” </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  And all the apostles deserted him and fled.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him;  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting there among the police officers, warming himself at the blaze of the fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any;  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him –  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  “We ourselves heard him say ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.’”  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. “Have you no answer to make?” he asked. “What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer. 

<p> A second time the high priest questioned him. “Are you,” he asked, “the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[62]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and you will all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” </span> <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  At this the high priest tore his vestments. “Why do we want any more witnesses?” he exclaimed.  <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  “You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?” They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, “Now play the prophet!” and even the police officers received him with blows. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up;  <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!”  <span class="v-num">[68]</span>  But Peter denied it. “I do not know or understand what you mean,” he replied. Then he went out into the porch;  <span class="v-num">[69]</span>  and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This is one of them!”  <span class="v-num">[70]</span>  But Peter again denied it. 

<p> Soon afterward the bystanders again said to him, “You certainly are one of them; why you are a Galilean!”  <span class="v-num">[71]</span>  But he said to them, “I swear that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I am lying!”  <span class="v-num">[72]</span>  At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him –  <span class="woc"> ‘Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times’; </span>  and, as he thought of it, he began to weep.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with elders and teachers of the Law – that is to say, the whole High Council – put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  he answered, “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Pilate, however, spoke to them again, “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Again they shouted, “Crucify him!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “Why, what harm has he done?” Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously, “Crucify him!”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard – that is the Government house – and they called the whole garrison together.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and then began to salute him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him – going down on their knees;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha – a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read – ‘THE KING OF THE JEWS.’  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted among outlaws.’  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said, “Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  come down from the cross and save yourself!”  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  And, at three, Jesus called out loudly,  <span class="woc"> “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?” </span>  which means  <span class="woc"> ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Some of those standing around heard this, and said, “Listen! He is calling for Elijah!”  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed his last, exclaimed, “This man must indeed have been God’s son!” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome –  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and give him support – besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day – the day before the Sabbath –  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Joseph from Ramah, a councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead;  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet around him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid. 

<p class="c-num">[Mark 16]</p>

<h5>The Risen Life Announced</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint the body of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, after sunrise.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter ‘He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened. 

<h5>A late appendix</h5>

<p>

<p align="center">----</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Afterward, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Moreover these signs will attend those who believe. In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> they will take up snakes in their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they will place their hands on sick people and they will recover.” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the signs which attended it. 

<h5>Another appendix</h5>

<p> But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

<p class="c-num">[Luke 1]</p>

<h5>Dedication</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To his Excellency, Theophilus. 

<p> Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterward became bearers of the message.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others. 

<h5>Birth, Parentage, Infancy and Boyhood</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  “How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, “You have been shown great favor – the Lord is with you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  when the angel spoke again, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  “The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary. “Let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  and cried aloud, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  And Mary said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “My soul exalts the Lord, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  and my spirit delights in God my Savior, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  for he has looked with favor on his humble servant girl. 

<p class="indent-2"> From now on all generations will call me blessed! 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  “For the Almighty has done great things for me, 

<p class="indent-2"> and holy is his name. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  He has mercy on those who revere him 

<p class="indent-2"> in every generation. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  “Mighty are the deeds of his arm; 

<p class="indent-2"> he has scattered the self-satisfied proud, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  he has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 

<p class="indent-2"> and he uplifts the humble, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  he has filled the hungry with good things, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the rich he has sent away empty. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  “He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> ever mindful of his mercy, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  as he promised to our ancestors 

<p class="indent-2"> for Abraham and his descendants for ever.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son;  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  and her neighbors and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father,  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  when his mother spoke up, “No, he is to be called John.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  “You have no relation of that name!” they exclaimed;  <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.  <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words – ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised  <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.  <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  All their neighbors were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about.  <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  All who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – “What can this child be destined to become?” For the Power of the Lord was with him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[68]</span>  “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[69]</span>  and has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation 

<p class="indent-2"> In the house of his servant David – 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[70]</span>  As he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old – 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[71]</span>  salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[72]</span>  showing mercy to our ancestors, 

<p class="indent-2"> And mindful of his sacred covenant. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[73]</span>  This was the oath which he swore to our ancestor Abraham – 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[74]</span>  That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[75]</span>  and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness, 

<p class="indent-2"> In his presence all our days. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[76]</span>  And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, 

<p class="indent-2"> For you will go before the Lord to make ready his way, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[77]</span>  to give his people the knowledge of salvation 

<p class="indent-2"> In the forgiveness of their sins, 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[78]</span>  through the tender mercy of our God, 

<p class="indent-2"> Whereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[79]</span>  to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death, 

<p class="indent-2"> And guide our feet into the way of peace.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[80]</span>  The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  (This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria).  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And everyone went to his own town to be registered.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea – because he belonged to the family and house of David –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  To be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  While they were there her time came,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “glory to God on high, 

<p class="indent-2"> And on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus – the name given him by the angel before his conception. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  in compliance with the Law of the Lord that every first-born male will be dedicated to the Lord,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and also to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord – a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “Now, Lord, you will let your servant go, 

<p class="indent-2"> According to your word, in peace, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  for my eyes have seen the salvation 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Which you have prepared in the sight of all nations – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  A light to bring light to the Gentiles, 

<p class="indent-2"> And to be the glory of your people Israel.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother, “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against –  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart – and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  When the child’s parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances;  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  All who listened to him marveled at his intelligence and his answers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him, “My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> “What made you search for me?” </span>  he answered.  <span class="woc"> “Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?” </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  His parents did not understand what he meant.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people.

<h5>The Preparation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 

<p class="indent-1"> “Make ready the way of the Lord, 

<p class="indent-2"> Make his paths straight. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Every chasm will be filled, 

<p class="indent-2"> Every mountain and hill will be leveled, 

<p class="indent-1"> The winding ways will be straightened, 

<p class="indent-2"> The rough roads made smooth, 

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and everyone will see the salvation of God.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “What are we to do then?” the people asked.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “Let anyone who has two coats,” answered John, “share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John, “Teacher, what are we to do?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,” John answered.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And when some soldiers on active service asked “And we – what are we to do?” he said, “Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  John, addressing them all, said, “I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> Eli,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Mattith, Levi, Melchiah, Janna, Joseph,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Mattithiah, Amos, Nahum, Azaliah, Nogah,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Mattith, Mattithiah, Shimei, Joseph, Josheh,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Johanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Salathiel, Neriah,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Melchiah, Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Joshua, Eliezer, Joram, Mattith, Levi,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Meleah, Menan, Mattithiah, Nathan, David,  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salah, Nahshon,  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Aminadab, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah,  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah,  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Kenan, Arpachshad, Shem, Noah, Lamech,  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalalel, Kenan,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Enosh, Seth and Adam the son of God. 

<p>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On returning from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the power of the Spirit through the wilderness for forty days, tempted by the devil. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  All that time he ate nothing; and, when it was over, he became hungry.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So the devil said to him, “If you are God’s Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And Jesus answered him,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says – ‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And the devil led Jesus up, and showing him in a single moment all the kingdoms of the earth, said to him,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  “I will give you all this power, and the splendor of them; for it has been given into my hands and I give it to whom I wish.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If you worship me, it will all be yours.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And Jesus answered him,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says – ‘You should worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The devil next led him into Jerusalem, and, placing him on the parapet of the Temple, said, “If you are God’s Son throw yourself down from here,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for scripture says – ‘He will give his angels commands about you, to guard you safely,’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And ‘On their hands they will lift you up, otherwise you might strike your foot against a stone.’”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But Jesus answered him,  <span class="woc"> “It is said – ‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When he had tried every kind of temptation, the devil left Jesus, until another opportunity. 

<h5>The Work in Galilee</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Moved by the power of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee. Reports about him spread through all that region;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was honored by everyone. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Coming to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, Jesus, as was his custom, went on the Sabbath into the synagogue, and stood up to read the scriptures.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah; and Jesus opened the book and found the place where it says – 

<p><p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘The Spirit of the Lord is on me, 

<p class="indent-1"> For he has consecrated me to bring good news to the poor, 

<p class="indent-1"> He has sent me to proclaim release to captives and restoration of sight to the blind, 

<p class="indent-2"> To set the oppressed at liberty, </span>

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> to proclaim the accepted year of the Lord.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then, closing the book and returning it to the attendant, he sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and Jesus began, 

<p><span class="woc"> “This very day this passage has been fulfilled in your hearing.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the beautiful words that fell from his lips. “Isn’t Joseph’s son?” they asked.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “Doubtless,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you will remind me of the saying – ‘Doctor, cure yourself;’ and you will say ‘Do here in your own country all that we have heard that has been done at Capernaum.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you,” </span>  he continued,  <span class="woc"> “that no prophet is acceptable in his own country. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> There were, doubtless, many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, and a severe famine prevailed throughout the country; </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> and yet it was not to one of them that Elijah was sent, but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidonia. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet it was not one of them who was made clean, but Naaman the Syrian.” </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  All the people in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Starting up, they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town stood, intending to hurl him down.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But he passed through the middle of the crowd and went on his way. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the Sabbath he taught the people.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  They were amazed at his teaching, because his words were spoken with authority.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly,  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “Stop! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  But Jesus rebuked the demon.  <span class="woc"> “Be silent! Come out from him,” </span>  he said. The demon flung the man down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without causing him further harm.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  And they were all lost in amazement, and kept saying to one another, “What words are these? For he gives his commands to the foul spirits with a marvelous authority, and they come out.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  And rumors about Jesus traveled through every place in the region. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and they asked Jesus to cure her.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Bending over her, he rebuked the fever; the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of them.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and cured them.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  And even demons came out from many people, screaming ‘You are the Son of God.’ Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried to detain him and prevent his leaving them.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Jesus, however, said to them,  <span class="woc"> “I must take the good news of the kingdom of God to the other town also, for that was why I was sent.” </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  And he continued to make his proclamation in the synagogues of Judea. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 5]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Once, when the people were pressing around Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,  <span class="woc"> “Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “We have been hard at work all night, Sir,” answered Simon, “and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming, “Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners.  <span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid,” </span>  Jesus said to Simon,  <span class="woc"> “from today you will catch people.” </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “I am willing; become clean.” </span>

<p> Instantly the leprosy left the man;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone,  <span class="woc"> “but,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.)  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When he saw their faith, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this. “Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins except God?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “What are you debating with yourselves? </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Which is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins have been forgiven you’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’? </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” </span>  – he spoke to the paralyzed man –  <span class="woc"> “To you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, “We have seen marvelous things today!” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Levi left everything and got up and followed him.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  And Levi gave a great entertainment at his house, in honor of Jesus; and a large number of tax-gatherers and others were having dinner with them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  In answer Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> I have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “John’s disciples,” they said to Jesus, “Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But Jesus answered them,  <span class="woc"> “Can you make the groom’s friends fast while the groom is with them? </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> But the days will come – a time when the groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those days come.” </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “No one ever tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new one will not match the old. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine itself will run out, and the skins be lost. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> But new wine must be put into fresh skins. </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. ‘No,’ they say, ‘the old is excellent.’” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 6]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?” asked some of the Pharisees.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jesus’ answer was,  <span class="woc"> “Haven’t you read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions – </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are allowed to eat it?” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Jesus, however, knew what was in the their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered,  <span class="woc"> “Stand up and come out into the middle.” </span>  The man stood up;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “I ask you, is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then, looking around at them all, he said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Stretch out your hand.” </span>  The man did so; and his hand had become sound.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named ‘apostles.’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Afterward Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"><span class="woc"> “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. 

<p class="indent-1"> Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> Blessed are you when people hate you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and when they expel you from among them, 

<p class="indent-2"> and insult you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and reject your name as an evil thing – 

<p class="indent-1"> because of the Son of Man. </span>

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Then indeed you may be glad and dance for joy, for be sure that your reward in heaven will be great; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> But 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> alas for you who are rich, 

<p class="indent-2"> for you have had your comforts in full. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you who are sated now,

<p class="c-num">[Luke 7]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jesus had brought to a conclusion all that he had then had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  A captain in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who was seriously ill – almost at the point of death.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave’s life.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to do so. “He deserves the favor from you,” they said,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “For he is devoted to our nation, and himself built our synagogue for us.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the captain sent some friends with the message – “Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the crowd which was following him, he said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you, nowhere in Israel have I met with such faith as this!” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And, when the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave recovered. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and a great crowd going with him.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Just as he approached the gate of the town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial – an only son, and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town were with her.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her,  <span class="woc"> “Do not weep.” </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Young man, I am speaking to you – Rise!” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. “A great prophet has arisen among us,” they said. “God has visited his people.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the neighboring countries as well. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  All these events were reported to John by his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When these men found Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for somebody else?”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So his answer to the question was,  <span class="woc"> “Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard – the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When John’s messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> This is the man of whom scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, 

<p class="indent-2"> and he will prepare your way before you.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  (All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John’s baptism, acknowledged the justice of God.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But the Pharisees and the students of the Law, having rejected John’s baptism, frustrated God’s purpose in regard to them.) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> “To what then,” </span>  Jesus continued,  <span class="woc"> “should I compare the people of the present generation? What are they like? </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> They are like some little children who are sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another – ‘We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not wept!’ </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> For now that John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking wine, you are saying ‘He has a demon in him’; </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, you are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to his house and took his place at the table.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Just then a woman, who was an outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  and placed herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head, repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “Had this man been ‘the prophet,’ he would have known who, and what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an outcast.”  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  But, addressing him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, I have something to say to you.” </span>

<p> “Pray do so, teacher,” Simon answered; and Jesus began,  <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “There were two people who were in debt to a moneylender; one owed five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty. </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> As they were unable to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, do you think, will love him the more?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  “I suppose,” answered Simon, “it will be the man to whom he forgave the greater debt.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “You are right,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  and then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon,  <span class="woc"> “Do you see this woman? I came into your house – you gave me no water for my feet, but she has made my feet wet with her tears and dried them with her hair. </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> You did not give me one kiss, but she, from the moment I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> You did not anoint even my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> So I tell you, her great love shows that her sins, many as they are, have been pardoned. One who is pardoned little loves little.” </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Then he said to the woman,  <span class="woc"> “Your sins have been pardoned.” </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  The other guests began to say to one another, “Who is this man who even pardons sins?”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  But Jesus said to the woman,  <span class="woc"> “Your faith has delivered you; go, and peace be with you.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 8]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Shortly afterward, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom seven demons had been expelled),  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others – all of whom provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of a parable,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> “The sower went out to sow his seed; and, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path and was trodden on; and the wild birds ate it up. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Other seed fell on rock, and, as soon as it began to grow, because it had no moisture, it withered away. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Other seed fell in the middle of brambles, but the brambles grew up with it and choked it entirely. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Other seed fell into rich soil, and grew, and gave a hundredfold return.” </span>  After saying this, Jesus cried aloud,  <span class="woc"> “Let those who have ears to hear with hear.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “To you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of God has been imparted, but to others in parables only, so that though they have eyes they may not see, and though they have ears, they may not understand. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> This is the parable – The seed is God’s message. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> By the seed which fell along the path are meant those who hear the message; but then comes the devil and carries away the message from their minds, to prevent their believing it and being saved. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> By the seed which fell on the rock are meant those who, as soon as they hear the message, welcome it joyfully; but they have no root, and believe it only for a time, and, when the time of temptation comes, they draw back. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> By that which fell among the brambles are meant those who hear the message, but who, as they go on their way, are completely choked by this world’s cares and wealth and pleasures, and bring nothing to perfection. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> But by that in the good ground are meant those who, having heard the message, keep it in the good, rich soil of their hearts, and patiently yield a return. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “No one sets light to a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts it underneath a couch, but they put it on a lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Nothing is hidden which will not be brought into the light of day, not ever kept hidden which will not some day become known and come into the light of day. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Take care, then, how you listen. For, to all those who have, more will be given; while, from all those who have nothing, even what they seem to have will be taken away.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Presently Jesus’ mother and brothers came where he was, but they were not able to join him because of the crowd.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So word was brought to him – ‘Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  His reply, spoken to them all, was,  <span class="woc"> “My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God’s teaching and do what it says.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go across the lake.” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So they put off. While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake, and their boat was filling and they were in danger.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So the disciples came and roused him. “Sir, Sir,” they cried, “we are lost!” Jesus rose and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm followed.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “Where is your faith?” </span>  he exclaimed. But in great awe and amazement they said to one another, “Who can this be, who commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And they reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the Wilds. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> “What is your name?” </span>  Jesus asked. 

<p> “Legion,” he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him);  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  There was a drove of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the drove rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go back to your home,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and relate the story of all that God has done for you.” So the man went through the whole town and proclaimed, as he went, all that Jesus had done for him. </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely around him.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And a woman, who had suffered from hemorrhage for twelve years, and whom no one could cure,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the hemorrhage ceased. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> “Who touched me?” </span>  Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed, “Why, Sir, the people are crowding around you and pressing against you!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> “Somebody touched me,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “for I felt that power had gone out from me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him, and that she had been cured instantly. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> “Daughter,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  Before he had finished speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, “Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the teacher further.”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader,  <span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.” </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  And everyone was weeping and mourning for her. 

<p><span class="woc"> “Do not weep,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “she is not dead; she is asleep.” </span> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice,  <span class="woc"> “Child, rise!” </span> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 9]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not,” </span>  he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> If people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protest against them.” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the good news and curing people everywhere. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Prince Herod heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Herod himself said, “John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?” And he endeavored to see him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But the people recognized him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, “Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms around about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is for you to give them something to eat.” </span>

<p> “We have not more than five loaves and two fish,” they answered. “Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  (For the men among them were about five thousand.)  <span class="woc"> “Get them seated in companies,” </span>  was his reply,  <span class="woc"> “about fifty in each.” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  This they did, and got all the people seated.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up – twelve baskets. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Afterward, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question –  <span class="woc"> “Who do the people say that I am?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “John the Baptist,” was their answer. “Others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “But you,” </span>  he went on,  <span class="woc"> “who do you say that I am?” </span>  And to this Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone;  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And to all present he said,  <span class="woc"> “If any one wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross daily, and follow me. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life – that person will save it. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> What good does it do someone if, when they has gained the whole world, they has lost or forfeited themselves? </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them, when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will not know death, until they have seen the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became of a glittering whiteness.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed, “Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what he was saying;  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  and from the cloud came a voice which said – “This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.”  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, “Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “Faithless and perverse generation!” </span>  Jesus exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “How long must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.” </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God. 

<p> In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,  <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.” </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  and then said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among you all – that person is great.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  John said, “Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> “None of you must prevent him,” </span>  Jesus said to John,  <span class="woc"> “whoever’s not against you is for you.” </span>

<h5>The Journey to Jerusalem</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  When James and John saw this, they said, “Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?”  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  But Jesus turned and rebuked them.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span> <span class="woc"> And they made their way to another village. </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[58]</span> <span class="woc"> “Foxes have holes,” </span>  he replied,  <span class="woc"> “and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span> <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  To another man Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span>

<p> “Let me first go and bury my father,” said the man.  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and wide the news of the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  “Master,” said another, “I will follow you; but first let me say goodbye to my family.”  <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “No one who looks back, after putting their hand to the plow, is fitted for the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 10]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, the Master appointed seventy-two other disciples, and sent them on as his messengers, two and two, in advance, to every town and place that he was himself intending to visit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “The harvest,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “is abundant, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send laborers to gather in his harvest. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> Now, go. Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like lambs among wolves. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not take a purse with you, or a bag, or sandals; and do not stop to greet anyone on your journey. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> Whatever house you go to stay at, begin by praying for a blessing on it. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Then, if anyone there is deserving of a blessing, your blessing will rest on him; but if not, it will come back on yourselves. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Remain at that same house, and eat and drink whatever they offer you; for the worker is worth their wages. Do not keep changing from one house to another. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Whatever town you visit, if the people welcome you, eat what is set before you; </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> cure the sick there, and tell people that the kingdom of God is close at hand. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> But, whatever town you go to visit, if the people do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘We wipe off the dust of your town which has clung to Our feet; still, be assured that the kingdom of God is close at Hand.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that the doom of Sodom will be more bearable on that day than the doom of that town. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the Miracles which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes and repented long ago. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable at the judgment than yours. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> Anyone who listens to you is listening to me, and anyone who rejects you is rejecting me; while the person who rejects me is rejecting him who sent me as his messenger.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When the seventy-two returned, they exclaimed joyfully, “Master, even the demons submit to us when we use your name.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “I have had visions of Satan, fallen, like lightning from the heavens. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Remember, I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to meet all the strength of the Enemy. Nothing will ever harm you in any way. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet do not rejoice in the fact that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names have been enrolled in heaven.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  At that same time, moved to exultation by the Holy Spirit, Jesus said: 

<p><p class="indent-1"><span class="woc"> “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike! Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you. </span>

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone know who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said to them alone,  <span class="woc"> “Blessed are the eyes that see what you are seeing; </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> for, I tell you, many prophets and kings wished for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never heard them.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Just then a Student of the Law came forward to test Jesus further. “Teacher,” he said, “what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “What is said in the Law?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “What do you read there?” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  His reply was – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as you love yourself.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> “You have answered right,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “Do that, and you will live.” </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  But the man, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  To which Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “A man was once going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him of everything, and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> As it chanced, a priest was going down by that road. He saw the man, but passed by on the opposite side. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> A Levite, too, did the same; he came up to the spot, but, when he saw the man, passed by on the opposite side. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> But a Samaritan, traveling that way, came upon the man, and, when he saw him, he was moved with compassion. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> He went to him and bound up his wounds, dressing them with oil and wine, and then put him on his own mule, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and whatever more you may spend I will myself repay you on my way back.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> Now which, do you think, of these three men,” asked Jesus, “proved himself a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  “The one that took pity on him,” was the answer; at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Go and do the same yourself.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Master’s feet, and listened to his teaching;  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  but Martha was distracted by the many preparations that she was making. So she went up to Jesus and said, “Master, do you approve of my sister’s leaving me to make preparations alone? Tell her to help me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “Martha, Martha,” </span>  replied the Master,  <span class="woc"> “you are anxious and trouble yourself about many things; </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> but only a few are necessary, or rather one. Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken away from her.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One day Jesus was at a certain place praying, and, when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “When you pray,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “say – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Father, 

<p class="indent-2"> May your name be held holy, 

<p class="indent-2"> your kingdom come. </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> Give us each day the bread that we will need; </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> and forgive us our sins, 

<p class="indent-1"> for we ourselves forgive everyone who wrongs us; 

<p class="indent-1"> and take us not into temptation.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Jesus also said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Suppose that one of you who has a friend were to go to him in the middle of the night and say ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> for a friend of mine has arrived at my house after a journey, and I have nothing to offer him;’ </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> And suppose that the other should answer from inside ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already fastened, and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything’; </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is a friend, yet because of his persistence he will rouse himself and give him what he wants. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> “And so I say to you – Ask, and your prayer will be granted, search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> For the person who asks receives, everyone who searches finds, and to the person who knocks the door will be opened. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> What father among you, if his son asks him for a fish, will give him a snake instead, </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> or, if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> If you, then, naturally wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Once Jesus was driving out a dumb demon, and, when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke. The people were amazed at this;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but some of them said, “He drives out demons by the help of Beelzebul, the chief of the demons”;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  while others, to test him, asked him for some sign from the heavens.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Jesus himself, however, was aware of what they were thinking, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Any kingdom wholly divided against itself becomes a desolation; and a divided house falls. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> So, too, if Satan is wholly divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I drive out demons by the help of Beelzebul. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> But, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> But, if it is by the hand of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> When a strong man is keeping guard, fully armed, over his own mansion, his property is in safety; </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> but, when one still stronger has attacked and overpowered him, he takes away all the weapons on which the other had relied, and divides his spoil. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> No sooner does a foul spirit leave someone, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest; and finding none, it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’; </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that person proves to be worse than the first.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd, raising her voice, exclaimed, “Happy was the mother who bore you and nursed you!”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “Rather, happy are those who listen to God’s message and keep it.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  As the crowds increased, Jesus began to speak,  <span class="woc"> “This generation is a wicked generation. It is asking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> For, as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the people of this generation, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> At the judgment the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> No one sets light to a lamp, and then puts it in the cellar or under a basket, but he puts it on the lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body, also, is lit up; but, as soon as your eye is diseased, your body, also, is darkened. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Take care, therefore, that the inner light is not darkness. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> If, then, your whole body is lit up, and no corner of it darkened, the whole will be lit up, just as when a lamp gives you light by its brilliance.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  As Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to breakfast with him, and Jesus went in and took his place at the table.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The Pharisee noticed, to his astonishment, that Jesus omitted the ceremonial washing before breakfast.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  But the Master said to him,  <span class="woc"> “You Pharisees do, it is true, clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are filled with greed and wickedness. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> Fools! Did not the maker of the outside make the inside too? </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> Only give away what is in them in charity, and at once you have the whole clean. </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> But alas for you Pharisees! You pay tithes on mint, rue, and herbs of all kinds, and pass over justice and love to God. These last you ought to have put into practice without neglecting the first. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you Pharisees! You delight to have the front seat in the synagogues, and to be greeted in the markets with respect. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you! You are like unsuspected graves, over which men walk unawares.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Here one of the students of the Law interrupted him by saying, “Teacher, when you say this, you are insulting us also.”  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  But Jesus went on,  <span class="woc"> “Alas for you, too, you students of the Law! You load people with loads that are too heavy to carry, but do not, yourselves, touch them with one of your fingers. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you! You build the monuments of the prophets whom your ancestors killed. </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> You are actually witnesses to your ancestors’ acts and show your approval of them, because, while they killed the prophets, you build tombs for them. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> That is why the wisdom of God said – ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> some of whom they will persecute and kill, in order that the blood of all the prophets that has been spilt since the creation of the world may be exacted from this generation – </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house of God.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be exacted from this generation. </span> <span class="v-num">[52]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for you students of the Law! You have taken away the key of the door of knowledge. You have not gone in yourselves and you have hindered those who try to go in.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  When Jesus left the house, the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began to press him hard and question him closely on many subjects,  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  laying traps for him, so as to seize on anything that he might say. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 12]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Meanwhile the people had gathered in thousands, so that they trod on one another, when Jesus, addressing himself to his disciples, began by saying to them,  <span class="woc"> “Be on your guard against the leaven – that is, the hypocrisy – of the Pharisees. </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> There is nothing, however covered up, which will not be uncovered, nor anything kept secret which will not become known. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> So all that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear, within closed doors, will be proclaimed on the housetops. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> To you who are my friends I say, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but after that can do no more. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> I will show you of whom you should be afraid. Be afraid of him who, after killing you, has the power to fling you into Gehenna. Yes, I say, be afraid of him. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not one of them has escaped God’s notice. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> No, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone, I tell you, who publicly acknowledges me, the Son of Man, also, will acknowledge before God’s angels; </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> but the person who publicly disowns me will be altogether disowned before God’s angels. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who will say anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but for the person who slanders the Holy Spirit there will be no forgiveness. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Whenever they take you before the synagogue Courts or the magistrates or other authorities, do not be anxious as to how you will defend yourselves, or what your defense will be, or what you will say; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> for the Holy Spirit will show you at the moment what you ought to say.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “Teacher,” a man in the crowd said to Jesus, “tell my brother to share the property with me.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Man, who made me a judge or an arbiter between you?” </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And then he added,  <span class="woc"> “Take care to keep yourselves free from every form of covetousness; for even in the height of their prosperity a person’s true life does not depend on what they have.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then Jesus told them this parable –  <span class="woc"> “There was once a rich man whose land was very fertile; </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> and he began to ask himself ‘What will I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops? </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> This is what I will do,’ he said; ‘I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them; </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> and I will say to myself, Now you have plenty of good things put by for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> But God said to the man ‘Fool! This very night your life is being demanded; and as for all you have prepared – who will have it?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> So it is with those who lay by wealth for themselves and are not rich to the glory of God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “That is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about the life here – what you can get to eat; or about your body – what you can get to wear. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> For life is more than food, and the body than its clothes. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> Think of the ravens – they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God feeds them! And how much more precious are you than birds! </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong your life a moment? </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if you cannot do even the smallest thing, why be anxious about other things? </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Think of the lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet, I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendor was not robed like one of these. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> If, even in the field, God so clothes the grass which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith! </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> And you – do not be always seeking what you can get to eat or what you can get to drink; and do not waver. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> These are the things for which all the nations of the world are seeking, and your Father knows that you need them. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> No, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added for you. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> So do not be afraid, my little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> “Sell what belongs to you, and give in charity. Make yourselves purses that will not wear out – an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, or moth works ruin. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Make yourselves ready, with your lamps alight; </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> and be like servants who are waiting for their Master’s return from his wedding, so that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door for him at once. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> Happy are those servants whom, on his return, the Master will find watching. I tell you that he will make himself ready, and have them take their places at the table, and will come and serve them. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Whether it is late at night, or in the early morning that he comes, if he finds all as it should be, then happy are they. </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> This you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch, and would not have let his house be broken into. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> You must also prepare, for when you are least expecting him the Son of Man will come.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  “Master,” said Peter, “are you telling this parable with reference to us or to everyone?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “Who, then,” </span>  replied the Master,  <span class="woc"> “is that trustworthy steward, the careful man, who will be placed by his master over his establishment, to give them their rations at the proper time? </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> Happy will that servant be whom his master, when he comes home, will find doing this. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> His master, I tell you, will put him in charge of the whole of his property. </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> But should that servant say to himself ‘My master is a long time coming,’ and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> that servant’s master will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour of which he is unaware, and will flog him severely and assign him his place among the untrustworthy. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> The servant who knows his master’s wishes and yet does not prepare and act accordingly will receive many lashes; </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> while one who does not know his master’s wishes, but acts so as to deserve a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone to whom much has been given much will be expected, and from the man to whom much has been entrusted the more will be demanded. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> I came to cast fire on the earth; and what more can I wish, if it is already kindled? </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> There is a baptism that I must undergo, and how great is my distress until it is over! </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> Do you think that I am here to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but to cause division. </span> <span class="v-num">[52]</span> <span class="woc"> For from this time, if there are five people in a house, they will be divided, three against two, and two against three. </span> <span class="v-num">[53]</span> <span class="woc"> Father will be opposed to son and son to father, mother to daughter and daughter to mother, mother-in-law to her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  And to the people Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once ‘There is a storm coming,’ and come it does. </span> <span class="v-num">[55]</span> <span class="woc"> And when you see that the wind is in the south, you say ‘It will be burning hot,’ and so it proves. </span> <span class="v-num">[56]</span> <span class="woc"> Hypocrites! You know how to judge of the earth and the sky; how is it, then, that you cannot judge of this time? </span> <span class="v-num">[57]</span> <span class="woc"> Why don’t you yourselves decide what is right? </span> <span class="v-num">[58]</span> <span class="woc"> When, for instance, you are going with your opponent before a magistrate, on your way to the court do your best to be quit of him; otherwise he might drag you before the judge, then the judge will hand you over to the bailiff of the court, and the bailiff throw you into prison. </span> <span class="v-num">[59]</span> <span class="woc"> You will not, I tell you, come out until you have paid the very last cent.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 13]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Just at that time some people had come to tell Jesus about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you suppose,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that, because these Galileans have suffered in this way, they were worse sinners than any other Galileans? </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Or those eighteen men at Siloam on whom the tower fell, killing them all, do you suppose that they were worse offenders than any other inhabitants of Jerusalem? </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same manner.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And Jesus told them this parable –  <span class="woc"> “A man, who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, came to look for fruit on it, but could not find any. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> So he said to his gardener ‘Three years now I have come to look for fruit on this fig tree, without finding any! Cut it down. Why should it rob the soil?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Leave it this one year more, Sir,’ the man answered, ‘until I have dug around it and manured it. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Then, if it bears in future, well and good; but if not, you can have it cut down.’” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the synagogues,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and he saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was wholly unable to raise herself.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  He placed his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to praise God.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people, “There are six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of those, and not on the Sabbath.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “You hypocrites!” </span>  the Master answered him.  <span class="woc"> “Does not everyone of you let your ox or your ass loose from its manger, and take it out to drink, on the Sabbath? </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> But this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has been kept in bondage by Satan for now eighteen years, ought not she to have been released from her bondage on the Sabbath?” </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As he said this, his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all the wonderful things that he was doing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what can I liken it? </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> It is like a mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden. The seed grew and became a tree, and the wild birds roosted in its branches.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And again Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “To what can I liken the kingdom of God? </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> It is like some yeast which a woman took and covered in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and making his way towards Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  “Master,” someone asked, “are there but few in the path of salvation?” And Jesus answered,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “Strive to go in by the small door. Many, I tell you, will seek to go in, but they will not be able, </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> when once the master of the house has got up and shut the door, while you begin to say, as you stand outside and knock, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ His answer will be – ‘I do not know where you come from.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Then you will begin to say ‘We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets,’ and his reply will be – </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘I do not know where you come from. Leave my presence, all you who are living in wickedness.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are being driven outside. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> People will come from East and West, and from North and South, and take their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> There are some who are last now who will then be first, and some who are first now who will then be last!” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Just then some Pharisees came up to Jesus and said, “Go away and leave this place, for Herod wants to kill you.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Go and say to that fox ‘Look you, I am driving out demons and will be completing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will have done.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> But today and tomorrow and the day after I must go on my way, because it cannot be that a prophet should meet his end outside Jerusalem. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You who slays the prophets and stones the messengers sent to you – Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children around me, as a hen takes her brood under her wings, and you would not come! </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Verily your house is left to you desolate! And never, I tell you, will you see me, until you say – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’” </span>

<p>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 14]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Is it allowable,” </span>  said Jesus, addressing the students of the Law and the Pharisees,  <span class="woc"> “to work a cure on the Sabbath, or is it not?” </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They remained silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Which of you, finding that your son or your ox has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull them out on the Sabbath day?” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And they could not make any answer to that. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for themselves, Jesus told them this parable –  <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “When you are invited by anyone to a wedding banquet, do not seat yourself in the best place. Someone of higher rank might have been invited by your host; </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> and the host who invited you both will come and say to you ‘Make room for this person,’ and then you will begin in confusion to take the lowest place. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> No, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place, so that, when the host who has invited you comes, he may say to you ‘Friend, come higher up’; and then you will be honored in the eyes of all your fellow guests. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then Jesus went on to say to the man who had invited him,  <span class="woc"> “When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not ask your friends, or your brothers or sisters, or your relatives, or rich neighbors, because they might invite you in return, and so you should be repaid. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> No, when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> and then you will be happy indeed, since they cannot reward you; for you will be rewarded at the resurrection of the good.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  One of the guests heard what he said and exclaimed, “Happy will be the person who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “A man was once giving a great dinner. He invited many people, </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> and sent his servant, when it was time for the dinner, to say to those who had been invited ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> They all with one accord began to ask to be excused. The first said to the servant ‘I have bought a field and am obliged to go and look at it. I must ask you to consider me excused.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> The next said ‘I have bought five pairs of bullocks, and I am on my way to try them. I must ask you to consider me excused’; </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> while the next said ‘I am just married, and for that reason I am unable to come.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> On his return the servant told his master all these answers. Then in anger the owner of the house said to his servant ‘Go out at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> Presently the servant said ‘Sir, your order has been carried out, and still there is room.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Go out,’ the master said, ‘into the roads and hedgerows, and make people come in, so that my house may be filled; </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> for I tell you all that not one of those people who were invited will taste my dinner.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  One day, when great crowds of people were walking with Jesus, he turned and said to them,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “If any one comes to me and does not hate their father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes and even their life, he can be no disciple of mine. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever does not carry their own cross, and walk in my steps, can be no disciple of mine. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Why, which of you, when you want to build a tower, does not first sit down and reckon the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it? – </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> Otherwise, if you have laid the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will laugh at you, </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> and say ‘Here is a person who began to build and was not able to finish!’ </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Or what king, when he is setting out to fight another king, does not first sit down and consider if with ten thousand men he is able to meet one who is coming against him with twenty thousand? </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> And if he cannot, then, while the other is still at a distance, he sends envoys and asks for terms of peace. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> And so with everyone of you who does not bid farewell to all you have – you cannot be a disciple of mine. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> Yes, salt is good; but, if the salt itself should lose its strength, what will be used to season it? </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> It is not fit either for the land or for the manure heap. People throw it away. Let those who have ears to hear with hear!” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 15]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The tax-gatherers and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus to listen to him;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  but the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law found fault. 

<p> “This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!” they complained. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Jesus told them this parable –  <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> “Who among you who has a hundred sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in the open country, and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> And, when he has found it, he puts in on his shoulders rejoicing; </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> and, on reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbors together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one outcast who repents, than over ninety-nine religious people, who have no need to repent. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> And, when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> So, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of God’s angels over one outcast who repents.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then Jesus continued,  <span class="woc"> “A man had two sons; </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> and the younger of them said to his father ‘Father, give me my share of the inheritance.’ So the father divided the property between them. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> A few days later the younger son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> After he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that country, and he began to be in actual want. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> So he went and engaged himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> But, when he came to himself, he said ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death! </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> I will get up and go to my father, and say to him “Father, I sinned against heaven and against you; </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.”’ </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> And he got up and went to his father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Father,’ the son said, ‘I sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> But the father turned to his servants and said ‘Be quick and fetch a robe – the very best – and put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet; </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> for here is my son who was dead, and is alive again, was lost, and is found.’ So they began making merry. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when he got near the house, he heard music and dancing, </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> and he called one of the servants and asked what it all meant. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Your brother has come back,’ the servant told him, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> This made him angry, and he would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘No,’ he said to his father, ‘look at all the years I have been serving you, without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might have a merrymaking with my friends. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> But, no sooner has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Child,’ the father answered, ‘you are always with me, and everything that I have is yours. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> We could but make merry and rejoice, for here is your brother who was dead, and is alive; who was lost, and is found.’” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 16]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “There was a rich man who had a steward; and this steward was maliciously accused to him of wasting his estate. </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> So the master called him and said ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give in your accounts, for you cannot act as steward any longer.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘What am I to do,’ the steward asked himself, ‘now that my master is taking the steward’s place away from me? I have not strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> I know what I will do, so that, as soon as I am turned out of my stewardship, people may welcome me into their homes.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> One by one he called up his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked of the first. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Four hundred and forty gallons of oil,’ answered the man. ‘Here is your agreement,’ he said; ‘sit down at once and make it two hundred and twenty.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> And you, the steward said to the next, ‘how much do you owe?’ ‘Seventy quarters of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Here is your agreement,’ the steward said; ‘make it fifty-six.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> His master complimented this dishonest steward on the shrewdness of his action. And indeed men of the world are shrewder in dealing with their fellow men than those who have the light. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> And I say to you ‘Win friends for yourselves with your dishonest money,’ so that, when it comes to an end, there may be a welcome for you into the Eternal Home. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is trustworthy in a great one also; and the person who is dishonest in the smallest matter is dishonest in a great one also. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> So, if you have proved untrustworthy with the dishonest money, who will trust you with the true? </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if you have proved untrustworthy with what does not belong to us, who will give you what is really our own? </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> No servant can serve two masters, for, either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  All this was said within hearing of the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, and they began to sneer at Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “You,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “are the ones who justify themselves before the world, but God can read your hearts; and what is highly esteemed among people may be an abomination in the sight of God. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> The Law and the prophets sufficed until the time of John. Since then the good news of the kingdom of God has been told, and everybody has been forcing their way into it. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> It would be easier for the heavens and the earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be lost. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is an adulterer, and the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> There was once a rich man, who dressed in purple robes and fine linen, and feasted every day in great splendor. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Near his gateway there had been laid a beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores, </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> and who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> After a time the beggar died, and was taken by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> In Hades he looked up in his torment, and saw Abraham at a distance and Lazarus at his side. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> So he called out ‘Pity me, Father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering agony in this flame.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Child,’ answered Abraham, ‘remember that you in your lifetime received what you thought desirable, just as Lazarus received what was not desirable; but now he has his consolation here, while you are suffering agony. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> And not only that, but between you and us there lies a great chasm, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they cross from there to us.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Then, Father,’ he said, ‘I beg you to send Lazarus to my father’s house – </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> For I have five brothers to warn them, so that they may not come to this place of torture also.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘They have the writings of Moses and the prophets,’ replied Abraham; ‘let them listen to them.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘But, Father Abraham,’ he urged, ‘if someone from the dead were to go to them, they would repent.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,’ answered Abraham, ‘they will not be persuaded, even if someone were to rise from the dead.’” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 17]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “It is inevitable that there should be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> It would be good for them if they had been flung into the sea with a millstone around their neck, rather than that they should prove a trap even one of these little ones. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> Be on your guard! If your brother or sister does wrong, rebuke them; but if they repent, forgive them. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> Even if they wrong you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says ‘I am sorry,’ you must forgive them.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Give us more faith,” said the apostles to the Master;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  but the Master said,  <span class="woc"> “If your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, ‘Come at once and take your place at the table,’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Instead of saying ‘Prepare my dinner, and then make yourself ready and serve me while I am eating and drinking, and after that you will eat and drink yourself’? </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> Does he feel grateful to his servant for doing what he is told? </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> And so with you – when you have done all that you have been told, still say ‘We are but useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly, “Jesus! Sir! Pity us!”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Jesus saw them, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Go and show yourselves to the priest.” </span>  And, as they were on their way, they were made clean.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and threw himself on his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Were not all the ten made clean? </span>  exclaimed Jesus.  <span class="woc"> But the nine – where are they? </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Were there none to come back and praise God except this foreigner? </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Get up,” </span>  he said to him,  <span class="woc"> “and go on your way. Your faith has delivered you.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Being once asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of God does not come in a way that can be seen, </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> nor will people say ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’; for the kingdom of God is within you! </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> The day will come,” </span>  he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of Man, and will not see it. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> People will say to you ‘There he is!’ Or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go and follow them. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> For, just as lightning will lighten and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with the Son of Man. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be rejected by the present generation. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be again in the days of the Son of Man. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> They were eating and drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the skies and destroyed them all. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> On that day, if a person is on their house-top and their goods in the house, they must not go down to get them; nor again must one who is on the farm turn back. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> Remember Lot’s wife. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> Whoever is eager to get the most out of their life will lose it; but whoever will lose it will preserve it. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> On that night, I tell you, of two people on the same bed, one will be taken and the other left; </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> of two women grinding grain together, one will be taken and the other left.” </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  “Where will it be, Master?” asked the disciples.  <span class="woc"> “Where there is a body,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “there will the vultures flock.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> “There was,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> For a time the judge refused, but afterward he said to himself ‘Although I am without fear of God or regard for people, </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the Master added,  <span class="woc"> “Listen to what this iniquitous judge says! </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> And God – won’t he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them – though he holds his hand? </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> He will, I tell you, give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this parable –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way – ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men – thieves, rogues, adulterers – or even like this tax-gatherer. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even to raise his eyes to heaven, but he kept striking his breast and saying ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Jesus, however, called the little children to him.  <span class="woc"> “Let the little children come to me,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And one of the leaders asked Jesus this question – “Good teacher, what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why do you call me good?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “No one is good but God. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> You know the commandments – Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honor your father and your mother.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “I have observed all these,” he replied, “from childhood.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Hearing this, Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  “Then who can be saved?” asked those who heard this.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “What is impossible with people is possible with God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “But we,” said Peter, “we left what belonged to us and followed you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Gathering the Twelve around him, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the prophets will be done to the Son of Man. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on; </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.” </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  The apostles did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them and they did not understand what he was saying. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  he shouted out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!”  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me!”  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him,  <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>

<p> “Master,” he said, “I want to recover my sight.”  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  And Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 19]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There was a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a commissioner of taxes and a rich man.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree, to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your house today.” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  On seeing this, everyone began to complain, “He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master, “Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times as much.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> “Salvation has come to this house today,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “for even this man is a son of Abraham. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> The Son of Man has come to search for those who are lost and to save them.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He said,  <span class="woc"> “A nobleman once went to a distant country to receive his appointment to a kingdom and then return. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds of silver each, and told them to trade with them during his absence. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> But his subjects hated him and sent envoys after him to say ‘We will not have this man as our king.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> On his return, after having been appointed king, he directed that the servants to whom he had given his money should be summoned, so that he might learn what amount of trade they had done. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> The first came up, and said ‘Sir, your ten pounds have made a hundred.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘Well done, good servant!’ exclaimed the master. ‘As you have proved trustworthy in a very small matter, I appoint you governor over ten towns.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> When the second came, he said ‘Your ten pounds, Sir, have produced fifty.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> So the master said to him ‘And you I appoint over five towns.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Another servant also came and said ‘Sir, here are your ten pounds; I have kept them put away in a handkerchief. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> For I was afraid of you, because you are a stern man. You take what you have not planted, and reap what you have not sown.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> The master answered ‘Out of your own mouth I judge you, you worthless servant. You knew that I am a stern man, that I take what I have not planted, and reap what I have not sown? </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Then why didn’t you put my money into a bank? And I, on my return, could have claimed it with interest. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> Take away from him the ten pounds,’ he said to those standing by, ‘and give them to the one who has the hundred.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘But, Sir,’ they said, ‘he has a hundred pounds already!’ </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘I tell you,’ he answered, ‘that, to him who has, more will be given, but, from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> But as for my enemies, these men who would not have me as their king, bring them here and put them to death in my presence.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem. 

<h5>The Last Days</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go to the village facing us,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and, when you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has yet ridden; untie it and lead it here. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> And, if anybody asks you ‘Why are you untying it?’, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants it.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So the two who were sent went and found it as Jesus had told them.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  While they were untying the foal, the owners asked them – “Why are you untying the foal?”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  And the two disciples answered – “The Master wants it.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus on it.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  As he went along, the people kept spreading their cloaks in the road.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  When he had almost reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, everyone of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all the miracles that they had seen: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Blessed is He who comes – 

<p class="indent-2"> Our king – in the name of the Lord! 

<p class="indent-1"> Peace in heaven, 

<p class="indent-2"> And glory on high.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, restrain your disciples.”  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that if they are silent, the stones will call out.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “If only you had known, while yet there was time – even you – the things that make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your sight. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> For a time is coming when your enemies will surround you with earthworks, and encircle you, and hem you in on all sides; </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> they will trample you down and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who were selling,  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says – ‘My house will be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the chief priests and teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and so also were the leaders of the people.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Yet they could not see what to do, for the people all hung on his words. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 20]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, joined by the elders, confronted him,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and addressing him, said, “Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it who has given you this authority?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “I, too,” </span>  said Jesus in reply,  <span class="woc"> “will ask you one question. Give me an answer to it. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> It is about John’s baptism – was it of divine or of human origin?” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But they began arguing together, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But, if we say ‘human,’ the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So they answered that they did not know its origin.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “Then I,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But Jesus began to tell the people this parable –  <span class="woc"> “A man once planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for a long while. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they could give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> The owner afterward sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this man too, and sent him away empty-handed. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> He sent a third; but they wounded this man also, and threw him outside. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘What should I do?’ said the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my son, who is very dear to me. Perhaps they will respect him.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> But, on seeing him, the tenants consulted with one another. ‘Here is the heir!’ they said. ‘Let us kill him, and then the inheritance will become ours.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> So they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them? </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> He will come and put those tenants to death, and will let the vineyard to others.” </span>

<p> “Heaven forbid!” they exclaimed when they heard it.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But Jesus looked at them and said,  <span class="woc"> “What then is the meaning of this passage? – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  After this the teachers of the Law and the chief priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Having watched their opportunity, they afterward sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor’s jurisdiction and authority.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  These spies asked Jesus a question. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly;  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> “Show me a coin. Whose head and title are on it?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “The Emperor’s,” they said; and Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “Well then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  They could not lay hold of this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Should a man’s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The second and third brothers both took her as their wife;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and so, too, did all seven – dying without children.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The woman herself was the last to die.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  About the woman, then – at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “The men and women of this world,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “marry and are given in marriage; </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or being married, </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God’s children. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> As to the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> Now he is not God of dead people, but of living. For in his sight all are alive.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “Well said, teacher!” exclaimed some of the teachers of the Law,  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  for they did not venture to question him any further.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David’s son? </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> For David, in the book of Psalms, says himself – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, </span>

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> David, then, calls him ‘lord,’ so how is he David’s son?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples,  <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> “Be on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at dinner. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[Luke 21]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Looking up, Jesus saw the rich people putting their gifts into the chests for the Temple offerings.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He saw, too, a widow in poor circumstances putting two small coins into them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you” </span> , he said  <span class="woc"> “that this poor widow has put in more than all the others; </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> for everyone else here put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, has put in all she had to live on.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When some of them spoke about the Temple being decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> “As for these things that you are looking at, a time is coming when not one stone will be left on another here. Every one will be thrown down.” </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So the disciples questioned Jesus, “But, teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is near?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “See that you are not led astray; for many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He,’ and ‘The time is close at hand.’ Do not follow them. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> And, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must occur first; but the end will not be at once.” </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> and there will be great earthquakes, and plagues and famines in various places, and there will be terrible appearances and signs in the heavens. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> Before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, and they will betray you to synagogues and put you in prison, when you will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Then will be your opportunity of witnessing for me. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> Make up your minds, therefore, not to prepare your defense; </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> for I will myself give you words, and a wisdom which all your opponents together will be unable to resist or defy. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> You will be betrayed even by your parents and brothers and sisters and sisters and relatives and friends, and they will cause some of you to be put to death, </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> and you will be hated by everyone because of me my name. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet not a single hair of your heads will be lost! </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> By your endurance you will win yourselves life. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> As soon, however, as you see Jerusalem surrounded by armed camps, then you may know that the hour of her desecration is at hand. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> Then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains, those who are in Jerusalem must leave at once, and those who are in the country places must not go into it. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> For these are to be the days of vengeance, when all that scripture says will be fulfilled. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great suffering in the land, and anger against this people. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be taken prisoners to every land, and Jerusalem will be under the heel of the Gentiles, until their day is over – as it will be. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> There will be signs, too, in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth despair among the nations, in their dismay at the roar of the sea and the surge. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> People’s hearts will fail them through dread of what is coming upon the world; for the forces of the heavens will be convulsed. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> And, when these things begin to occur, look upwards and lift your heads, for your deliverance will be at hand.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then he taught them a lesson, saying –  <span class="woc"> “Look at the fig tree and all the other trees. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> As soon as they shoot, you know, as you look at them, without being told, that summer is near. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away until all has taken place. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> Be on your guard or your minds will become dulled by debauches or drunkenness or the anxieties of life, and ‘that day’ will close on you suddenly like a trap. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> For come it will on all who are living upon the face of the whole earth. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> Be on the watch at all times, and pray that you may have strength to escape all that is destined to happen, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  During the days, Jesus continued to teach in the Temple Courts, but he went out and spent the nights on the hill called the ‘Mount of Olives.’  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  And all the people would get up early in the morning and come to listen to him in the Temple Courts. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 22]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them,  <span class="woc"> “Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Where do you wish us to make preparations?” they asked.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “when you have got into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters; </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> and you will say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says to you – Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “I have most earnestly wished,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> For I tell you that I will not eat it again, until it has had its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Take this and share it among you. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink of the juice of the grape, until the kingdom of God has come.” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words,  <span class="woc"> “This is my body. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: which is now to be given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me. And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying: “This cup is the New Covenant made by my blood which is being poured out on your behalf.”  ] <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on the table! </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Jesus, however, said,  <span class="woc"> “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled ‘Benefactors.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Which is the greater – the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> You are the men who have stood by me in my trials; </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> and, just as my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places, </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat, </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen the others.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “Master,” said Peter, “with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “I tell you, Peter,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “the cock will not crow today until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.” </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Then he said to them all,  <span class="woc"> “When I sent you out as my messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?” </span>

<p> “No; nothing,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> “Now, however,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> For, I tell you, that passage of scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says – ‘He was counted among the godless’; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfillment.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Master,” they exclaimed, “look, here are two swords!” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Enough!” </span>  said Jesus. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  And, when he reached the spot, he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Pray that you may not fall into temptation.” </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but your be done.” </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him. [Note:        Some later manuscripts do not contain verses 43 or 44.  ] <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why are you asleep?” </span>  he asked them.  <span class="woc"> “Rise and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation.” </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  at which Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?” </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, “Master, should we use our swords?”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear;  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Let me at least do this”; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound. </span> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs? </span> <span class="v-num">[53]</span> <span class="woc"> When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, “Why, this man was one of his companions!”  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied.  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  A little while afterward someone else – a man – saw him and said, “Why, you are one of them!” 

<p> “No,” Peter said, “I am not.”  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  About an hour later another man declared positively, “This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!”  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  But Peter said, “I do not know what you are speaking about.” Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him –  <span class="woc"> “Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times”; </span> <span class="v-num">[62]</span>  and he went outside and wept bitterly. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[63]</span>  The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.  <span class="v-num">[64]</span>  They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said. “Who was it that struck you?”  <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  And they heaped many other insults on him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council.  <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  “If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “If I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you will not believe me; </span> <span class="v-num">[68]</span> <span class="woc"> and, if I question you, you will not answer. </span> <span class="v-num">[69]</span> <span class="woc"> But from this hour the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[70]</span>  “Are you, then, the Son of God?” they all asked.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “I am.” </span> <span class="v-num">[71]</span>  At this they exclaimed, “Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!” 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 23]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And they began to accuse him, “This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is ‘Christ, a king.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “Are you the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked him.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said, “I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But they insisted, “He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe around him, and then sent him back to Pilate.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and said to them, “You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  so I will have him scourged, and then release him.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: He had to release someone to them at the feast.  ] <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But they began to shout as one man, “Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  (Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.)  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  but they kept calling out, “Crucify, crucify him!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So Jesus turned and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> A time, I tell you, is coming, when it will be said – ‘Happy are the women who are barren, and those who have never borne children or nursed them!’ </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> At that time people will begin to say to the mountains ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills ‘Cover us.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> If what you see is done while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?” </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When they had reached the place called ‘The Skull,’ there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.” </span>  His clothes they divided among them by casting lots.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.”  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  and saying as they did so, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Above him were the words – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him. “Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us,” he said.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  But the other rebuked him. “Haven’t you,” he said, “any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence?  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  And we justly so, for we are only reaping our deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Jesus,” he went on, “do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.”  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you, this very day you will be with me in Paradise.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon,  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  the sun being eclipsed; and the Temple curtain was torn down the middle.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said,  <span class="woc"> “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” </span>  And with these words he expired.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  The Roman captain, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming, “This must have been a good man!”  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  All the people who had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home beating their breasts.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all this. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  (This man had not assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to Ramah, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of God.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  It was the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began.  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how the body of Jesus was laid,  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  and then went home, and prepared spices and perfumes. 

<h5>The Risen Life</h5>

<p> During the Sabbath they rested, as directed by the commandment. 

<p class="c-num">[Luke 24]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, taking with them the spices that they had prepared.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and, on going into it, they could not find the body [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: of the Lord Jesus.  ] .  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: He is not here but he has risen.  ]  Remember how he spoke to you before he left Galilee –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then they remembered the words of Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down he saw nothing but the linen wrappings, and he went away, wondering to himself at what had taken place.  ]

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognize him.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?” </span>  Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, “Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “What things do you mean?” </span>  asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterward crucified him.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Then Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Foolish men, slow to accept all that the prophets have said! </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> Was not the Christ bound to undergo this suffering before entering into his glory?” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further;  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from their sight.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  “How our hearts glowed,” the disciples said to each other, “while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together,  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognized Jesus at the breaking of the bread.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them. [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: and said, “Peace be with you.”  ] <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  but Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds? </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: After saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.  ] <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Have you anything here to eat?” </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  They handed him a piece of broiled fish,  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  and he took it and ate it before their eyes.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> “This is what I told you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “when I was still with you – that everything that had been written about me in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them,  <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> “Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he will rise again from the dead on the third day, </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> and that repentance for forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed on his authority to all the nations – beginning at Jerusalem. </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> You yourselves are to be witnesses to all this. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> And now I am myself about to send you that which my Father has promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested with power from above.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them. [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: and was carried up into heaven.  ] <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  They returned [Note:        Some later manuscripts read: They bowed to the ground before him and returned.  ]  to Jerusalem full of joy;  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  and they were constantly in the Temple Courts, blessing God.

<p class="c-num">[John 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the beginning the Word was; 

<p class="indent-2"> and the Word was with God; 

<p class="indent-2"> and the Word was God. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He was in the beginning with God; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  through him all things came into being, 

<p class="indent-2"> and nothing came into being apart from him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  That which came into being in him was life; 

<p class="indent-2"> and the life was the light of humanity; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and the light shines in the darkness, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the darkness never overpowered it. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light 

<p class="indent-2"> so that through him everyone might believe. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  He was not the light, 

<p class="indent-2"> but he came to bear witness to the light. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He was in the world; 

<p class="indent-2"> and through him the world came into being – 

<p class="indent-2"> yet the world did not know him. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He came to his own – 

<p class="indent-2"> yet his own did not receive him. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God – 

<p class="indent-2"> to those who believe in his name. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life, 

<p class="indent-2"> but to God. 

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And the Word became human, and lived among us, 

<p class="indent-2"> (We saw his glory – the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father), 

<p class="indent-2"> full of love and truth. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  (John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke – 

<p class="indent-2"> “He who is coming after me is now before me, 

<p class="indent-2"> for he was ever first”); 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  out of his fullness we have all received some gift, 

<p class="indent-2"> gift after gift of love; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for the Law was given through Moses, 

<p class="indent-2"> love and truth came through Jesus Christ. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  No one has ever yet seen God; 

<p class="indent-2"> God the Only Son, who is ever with the Father – 

<p class="indent-1"> He has revealed him. 

<p>

<h5>The Preparation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?” 

<p> “No,” he said, “I am not.” 

<p> “Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  “I,” he answered, “am – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord’, 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> as the prophet Isaiah said.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  These men had been sent from the Pharisees;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  I was taking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  John also said: 

<p> “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  But Jesus turned around, and saw them following.  <span class="woc"> “What are you looking for?” </span>  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “Come, and you will see,” </span>  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. 

<p> It was then about four in the afternoon.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas” </span>  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  “How do you know me?” asked Nathanael.  <span class="woc"> “Even before Philip called you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  “Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you believe in me,” </span>  asked Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those! </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” </span>

<h5>The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> “What do you want with me?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “My time has not come yet.” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Jesus said to the servants,  <span class="woc"> “Fill the water-jars with water.” </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added,  <span class="woc"> “Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.” </span>  The servants did so.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and said to the pigeon-dealers,  <span class="woc"> “Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.” </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “Destroy this temple,” </span>  was his answer,  <span class="woc"> “and I will raise it in three days.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them. 

<p class="c-num">[John 3]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  exclaimed Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “What! You a teacher of Israel,” </span>  exclaimed Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet do not understand this! </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things? </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven – the Son of Man himself. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> And, as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up; </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed; </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do. </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  (For John had not yet been imprisoned).  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and the disciples came to John and said, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  He must become greater, and I less.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure. 

<p class="c-num">[John 4]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  (Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He had to pass through Samaria,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her –  <span class="woc"> “Give me some to drink,” </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “If you knew of the gift of God,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said. “Where did you get that ‘living water?’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> “All who drink of this water,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “will be thirsty again; </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go and call your husband,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and then come back.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  “I have no husband,” answered the woman.  <span class="woc"> “You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “Believe me,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am he,” </span>  Jesus said to her,  <span class="woc"> “I who am speaking to you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And the people left the town and went to see Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> “I have food to eat,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “of which you know nothing.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “My food,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest! </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> For here the proverb holds good – ‘One sows, another reaps.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  “Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him  <span class="woc"> ‘Your son is living’ </span> ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee. 

<p class="c-num">[John 5]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades around it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had.  ] <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Do you wish to be cured?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “I have no one, Sir,” the sick man answered, “to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “Stand up,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “take up your mat, and walk.” </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Take up your mat and walk.’” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “Who was it,” they asked, “that said to you  <span class="woc"> ‘Take up your mat and walk’?” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So Jesus made this further reply,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son, </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> so that everyone may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him; </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice, </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> and will come out – those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> “If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy; </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John’s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out – the work that I am doing – is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form; </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger. </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life; </span>  and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me,  <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> you refuse to come to me to have life. </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “I do not receive honor from people, </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> but I know this of you, that you have not the love of God in your hearts. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> How can you believe in me, when you receive honor from one another and do not desire the honor which comes from the only God? </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> For, had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote; </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my teaching?” </span>

<p class="c-num">[John 6]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,  <span class="woc"> “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,” answered Philip, “it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “There is a boy here,” said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Make the people sit down,” </span>  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.” </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, “This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “It is I; do not be afraid!” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The people who remained on the further side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “How,” they asked, “are we to do the work that God wants us to do?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “The work that God wants you to do,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  “What sign, then,” they asked, “are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven; </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “Master,” they exclaimed, “give us that bread always!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am the life-giving bread,” </span>  Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst again. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me. </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> For I have come down from heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me; </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying –  <span class="woc"> ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  “Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,” they asked, “whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not murmur among yourselves,” </span>  said Jesus in reply.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> “No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day. </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> It is said in the prophets – ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life. </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the life-giving bread. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died. </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> The bread that comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die. </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  They began disputing with one another, “How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you. </span> <span class="v-num">[54]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day. </span> <span class="v-num">[55]</span> <span class="woc"> For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink. </span> <span class="v-num">[56]</span> <span class="woc"> Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them. </span> <span class="v-num">[57]</span> <span class="woc"> As the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live because I live. </span> <span class="v-num">[58]</span> <span class="woc"> That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?”  <span class="v-num">[61]</span>  But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them,  <span class="v-num">[62]</span> <span class="woc"> “Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? </span> <span class="v-num">[63]</span> <span class="woc"> It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life. </span> <span class="v-num">[64]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.” </span>  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;  <span class="v-num">[65]</span>  and he added,  <span class="woc"> “This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.” </span> <span class="v-num">[66]</span>  After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.  <span class="v-num">[67]</span>  So Jesus said to the Twelve,  <span class="woc"> “Do you also wish to leave me?” </span> <span class="v-num">[68]</span>  But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;  <span class="v-num">[69]</span>  and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[70]</span> <span class="woc"> “Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.” </span> <span class="v-num">[71]</span>  He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve. 

<p class="c-num">[John 7]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For even his brothers did not believe in him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> “My time,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is not come yet, but your time is always here. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.” </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So, in reply, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> “There was one thing I did,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “at which you are all still wondering. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath? </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said,  <span class="woc"> “Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.” </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  “Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  What does he mean by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone thirsts, they should come to me, and drink. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.” </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  (By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  “No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  “What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  “Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  “Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  “Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  And everyone went home 

<p class="c-num">[John 8]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives [Note:        This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.  ] .  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “No one, Sir,” she answered. 

<p> “Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Jesus again addressed the people.  <span class="woc"> “I am the light of the world,” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> “Even if I bear testimony to myself,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> You judge by appearances; I judge no one. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> “Where is your father, then?” </span>  they asked.  <span class="woc"> “You know neither me nor my Father,” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Jesus again spoke to the people.  <span class="woc"> “I am going away,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says –  <span class="woc"> ‘You cannot go where I am going’?” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “You,” </span>  added Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not; </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “Who are you?” they asked.  <span class="woc"> “Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  They did not understand that he meant the Father.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.” </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him,  <span class="woc"> “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples; </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> and you find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘you will be set free’?” </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “everyone who sins is a slave to sin. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed! </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts. </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “Our father is Abraham,” was their answer.  <span class="woc"> “If you are Abraham’s children,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “do what Abraham did. </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way. </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> You are doing what your own father does.” </span>

<p> “We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father – God himself.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> “If God were your Father,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger. </span> <span class="v-num">[43]</span> <span class="woc"> How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message. </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span> <span class="woc"> As for you, you are children of your Father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying. </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth? </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  “Aren’t we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am not possessed by a demon,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me. </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides. </span> <span class="v-num">[51]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  “Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say  <span class="woc"> ‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span> <span class="woc"> “If I do honor to myself,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor – and you say that he is your God; </span> <span class="v-num">[55]</span> <span class="woc"> and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart. </span> <span class="v-num">[56]</span> <span class="woc"> Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  “You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[58]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “before Abraham existed I was.” </span> <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> “Neither the man nor the parents,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam” </span>  (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “How did you get your sight, then?” they asked.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  “The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’ </span>  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and gave him his sight.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put clay on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.” 

<p> “How is it possible,” retorted others, “for a bad man to give signs like this?”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  “What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  “I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  “Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight!  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> “Not only have you seen him,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but it is he who is now speaking to you.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him;  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  and Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.” </span> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span> <span class="woc"> “If you had been blind,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains. </span>

<p class="c-num">[John 10]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber; </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.” </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So he continued,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me – </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “I have told you so,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me; </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands. </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands. </span> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> The Father and I are one.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and seeing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  “It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “Are there not,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “these words in your Law – ‘I said, You are gods’? </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ – and scripture cannot be set aside – </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’? </span> <span class="v-num">[37]</span> <span class="woc"> If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me; </span> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.” </span> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  “John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.”  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  And many learned to believe in Jesus there. 

<p class="c-num">[John 11]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and, when Jesus heard it, he said,  <span class="woc"> “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.” </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then, after that, he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go to Judea again.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> “Are not there twelve hours in the day?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun; </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.” </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And, when he had said this, he added,  <span class="woc"> “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  “If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then he said to them plainly,  <span class="woc"> “Lazarus is dead; </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of brother’s death.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “Your brother will rise to life,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> “I am the resurrection and the life,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “He who believes in me will live, though he die; </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  “Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!”  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “Where have you buried him?” </span>  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Jesus burst into tears.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span> <span class="woc"> “Move the stone away,” </span>  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span> <span class="woc"> “Didn’t I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?” </span> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said,  <span class="woc"> “Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer; </span> <span class="v-num">[42]</span> <span class="woc"> I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice,  <span class="woc"> “Lazarus! Come out!” </span> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth.  <span class="woc"> “Set him free,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and let him go.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, learned to believe in him.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our city and our Nationality.”  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  “You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.  <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him. 

<p class="c-num">[John 12]</p>

<h5>The Last Days</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There a supper was given in honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “Leave her alone,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord – The king of Israel!”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  ‘Fear not, people of Zion; Your king is coming to you, Sitting on the foal of an ass.’  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  This was his reply –  <span class="woc"> “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour – </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> Father, honor your own name.” </span>  At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span> <span class="woc"> “It was not for my sake that the voice came,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but for yours. </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out; </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be  <span class="woc"> ‘lifted up’ </span>  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> “Only a little while longer,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going. </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.” </span>  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words –  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  ‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.’  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues;  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  for they valued honor from people more than honor from God.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  But Jesus had proclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me; </span> <span class="v-num">[45]</span> <span class="woc"> and he who sees me sees him who sent me. </span> <span class="v-num">[46]</span> <span class="woc"> I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness. </span> <span class="v-num">[47]</span> <span class="woc"> When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span> <span class="v-num">[48]</span> <span class="woc"> He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day. </span> <span class="v-num">[49]</span> <span class="woc"> For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver. </span> <span class="v-num">[50]</span> <span class="woc"> And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.” </span>

<p class="c-num">[John 13]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God –  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> “You do not understand now what I am doing,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but you will learn by and by.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “You will never wash my feet!” exclaimed Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Unless I wash you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you have nothing in common with me.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  “Then, Master, not my feet only,” exclaimed Simon Peter, “but also my hands and my head.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “He who has bathed,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,” </span>  he said to the disciples,  <span class="woc"> “are clean, yet not all of you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said  <span class="woc"> ‘You are not all clean.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again.  <span class="woc"> “Do you understand what I have been doing to you?” </span>  he asked.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> “You yourselves call me ‘the teacher’ and ‘the Master’, and you are right, for I am both. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> If I, then – ‘the Master’ and ‘the teacher’ – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet; </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, “Tell me who it is that he means.”  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, “Who is it, Master?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> “It is the one,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.” </span>  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Do at once what you are going to do.” </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him; </span> <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – ‘You cannot come where I am going’ – I now say to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you. </span> <span class="v-num">[35]</span> <span class="woc"> It is by this that everyone will recognize you as my disciples – by your loving one another.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  “Where are you going, Master?” asked Peter.  <span class="woc"> “I am going where you cannot now follow me,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but you will follow me later.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  “Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span> <span class="woc"> “Will you lay down your life for me?” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times. </span>

<p class="c-num">[John 14]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> <span class="woc"> Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. </span> <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> In my Father’s Home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am; </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> and you know the way to the place where I am going.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “We do not know where you are going, Master,” said Thomas. “So how can we know the way?”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> If you had recognized me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognize him, indeed you have already seen him.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “Master, show us the Father,” said Philip, “and we will be satisfied.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> “Have I been all this time among you,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet you, Philip, have not recognized me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, ‘Show us the Father’? </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> Believe me,” he said to them all, “when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honored in the Son. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> If you ask anything, in my name, I will do it. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart, </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you always – the Spirit of truth. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognize him, but you recognize him, because he is always with you, and is within you. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> I will not leave you bereaved; I will come to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living also. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> At that time you will recognize that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> It is they who have my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “What has happened, Master,” said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), “that you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “Whoever loves me,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> I have told you all this while still with you, </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> but the helper – the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name – will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> Peace be with you!

Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you.

He has nothing in common with me; </span> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going. </span>

Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honored. </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love. </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father’s commands to heart and remain in his love. </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> This is my command – love one another, as I have loved you. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> And you are my friends, if you do what I command you. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name. </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> I am giving you these commands that you may love one another. </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me. </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span> <span class="woc"> If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you. </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> Remember what I said to you – ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> The person who hates me hates my Father also. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – ‘They hated me without cause.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me; </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first. </span>

<p class="c-num">[John 16]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span> <span class="woc"> They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God. </span> <span class="v-num">[3]</span> <span class="woc"> They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me. </span> <span class="v-num">[4]</span> <span class="woc"> But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself. </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – ‘Where are you going?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[7]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment; </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span> <span class="woc"> as to sin, for people do not believe in me; </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer; </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned. </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come. </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span> <span class="woc"> He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us  <span class="woc"> ‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’; </span>  and by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘Because I am going to the Father’? </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  What does he mean by  <span class="woc"> ‘In a little while’?” </span>  they said. “We do not know what he is speaking about.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’? </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world. </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy. </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name. </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span> <span class="woc"> So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span> <span class="woc"> I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly. </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span> <span class="woc"> You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you; </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span> <span class="woc"> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father. </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span> <span class="woc"> I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you believe that already?” </span>  Jesus answered.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span> <span class="woc"> “Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span> <span class="v-num">[33]</span> <span class="woc"> I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heaven-wards, and said:

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the brook Kedron to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some police officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “For whom are you looking?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer.  <span class="woc"> “I am he,” </span>  said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When Jesus said  <span class="woc"> ‘I am he,’ </span>  they drew back and fell to the ground.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> “I have already told you that I am he,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.” </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This was in fulfillment of his words –  <span class="woc"> ‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But Jesus said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish police, arrested Jesus and bound him,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So the maidservant said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” 

<p> “No, I am not,” he said.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The servants and police officers were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span> <span class="woc"> “For my part,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret. </span> <span class="v-num">[21]</span> <span class="woc"> Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  When Jesus said this, one of the police officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> “If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but if not, why do you strike me?” </span> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  “If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  “Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.” 

<p> “We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied –  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  In fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do you ask me that yourself?” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “or did others say it to you about me?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  “Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span> <span class="woc"> “My kingly power,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  “So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate.  <span class="woc"> “Yes, it is true I am a king,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  “No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber. 

<p class="c-num">[John 19]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” 

<p> “Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  “But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “You would have no power over me at all,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!” 

<p> “What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> So they took Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘They shared my clothes among them, 

<p class="indent-2"> And over my clothing they cast lots.’ 

<p> That was what the soldiers did.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother,  <span class="woc"> “There is your son.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then he said to that disciple,  <span class="woc"> “There is your mother.” </span>  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture,  <span class="woc"> “I am thirsty.” </span> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “All is finished!” </span>  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. 

<p class="c-num">[John 20]</p>

<h5>The Risen Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The disciples then returned to their companions. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> “Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” </span>  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> “Mary!” </span>  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).  <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> “Do not hold me,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.” </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you”; </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Again Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  After saying this, he breathed on them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Receive the Holy Spirit; </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span> <span class="woc"> if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!” 

<p> “Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,” he exclaimed, “and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you.” </span> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Then he said to Thomas,  <span class="woc"> “Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.” </span> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And Thomas exclaimed, “My Master, and my God!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span> <span class="woc"> “Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life. 

<p class="c-num">[John 21]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “I am going fishing.” 

<p> “We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> “My children,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “have you anything to eat?” </span>

<p> “No,” they answered.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> “Cast your net to the right of the boat,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will find fish.” </span>  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> “Come and have breakfast.” </span> , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?” </span>

<p> “Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Feed my lambs,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then, a second time, Jesus asked,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” </span>

<p> “Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Tend my sheep,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The third time, Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, are you my friend?” </span>  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.” 

<p><span class="woc"> “Feed my sheep,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.” </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span> <span class="woc"> “If it is my will that he should wait until I come,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.” </span> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said  <span class="woc"> “If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?” </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.

<p class="c-num">[Acts 1]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> 

<h3>The Church and the Jews</h3>

<p>

<h5>The Acts of the Apostles Peter and John</h5>

<p> The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise –  <span class="woc"> “that promise,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “of which you have heard me speak; </span> <span class="v-num">[5]</span> <span class="woc"> for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question – “Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  His answer was,  <span class="woc"> “It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision; </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span> <span class="woc"> but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and said, “People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  About this time, at a meeting of the Lord’s followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “Friends,” he said, “it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  (This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, ‘Akeldama,’ which means the ‘Field of Blood.’) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “For in the book of Psalms,” Peter continued, “it is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Let his home become desolate, 

<p class="indent-1"> And let no one live in it’; 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> and also – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘His office let another take.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us –  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  from his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us – someone must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and they offered this prayer – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  to take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 2]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, “What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians – yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They were all utterly amazed and bewildered. 

<p> “What does it mean?” they asked one another.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But there were some who said with a sneer, “They have had too much new wine.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  ‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says, 

<p class="indent-2"> ‘That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity; 

<p class="indent-1"> Your sons and your daughters will become prophets, 

<p class="indent-1"> Your young men will see visions, 

<p class="indent-1"> And your old men dream dreams; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Yes, even on the slaves – for they are mine – both men and women, 

<p class="indent-2"> I will in those days pour out my Spirit, 

<p class="indent-3"> And they will become prophets; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And I will show wonders in the heavens above, 

<p class="indent-1"> And signs on the earth below – 

<p class="indent-2"> Blood and fire and mist of smoke; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The sun will become darkness, 

<p class="indent-1"> And the moon blood-red, 

<p class="indent-2"> Before the day of the Lord comes – that great and awful day. 

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well –  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  He, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight; 

<p class="indent-2"> Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, 

<p class="indent-2"> Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  You have shown me the path to life, 

<p class="indent-2"> You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord said to my master, “Sit on my right hand, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ – this Jesus whom you crucified.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Friends, what can we do?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them – “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 3]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o’clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called ‘the Beautiful Gate,’ to beg of those who went in.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, “Look at us.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  but Peter added, “I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.”  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  All the people saw him walking about and praising God;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and, when they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered around them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  On seeing this, Peter said to the people, “People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honor to his servant Jesus – him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead – and of that we are ourselves witnesses.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has – by his name – been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Moses himself said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.” 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them. 

<p> “By what power,” they asked, “Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, “Leaders of the people and elders,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead – it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “What are we to do to these men?” they asked one another. “That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him –  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> “Sovereign Lord, it is you who has made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said – 

<p class="indent-2"> ‘Why did the nations rage, 

<p class="indent-3"> and the peoples form vain designs? 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The kings of the earth set their array, 

<p class="indent-2"> and its rulers gathered together, 

<p class="indent-3"> against the Lord and against his Christ.’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides –  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  while you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The apostles continued with great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s blessing rested on them all abundantly.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Nor was there anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  And laid them at the apostles’ feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his wants.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from the apostles the additional name of ‘Barnabas’ – which means ‘The Consoler,’)  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 5]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  There was, however, a man named Ananias, who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and, with her connivance, kept back some of the proceeds. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles’ feet. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “Ananias,” Peter exclaimed, “how is it that Satan has so taken possession of your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit, and kept back a part of the money paid for the land?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  While it was unsold, was not it your own? And after it was sold, was not the money at your own disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not to people, but to God!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and everyone who heard of it was appalled.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The young men got up, and, winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  “Is it true,” Peter asked, addressing her, “that you sold your land for such a sum?” 

<p> “Yes,” she answered, “we did.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then Peter said, “How did you come to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door; and they will carry you out too.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Instantly Sapphira fell down at Peter’s feet and expired. On coming in, the young men found her dead; so they carried her out and buried her by her husband’s side.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The whole church and all who heard of these events were appalled. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people, through the instrumentality of the apostles, whose custom it was to meet all together in the Colonnade of Solomon;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  but of the rest no one ventured to join them. On the other hand, the people were full of their praise,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and still larger numbers, both of men and women, as they became believers in the Lord, were added to their number.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on someone of them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Besides this, the inhabitants of the towns around Jerusalem flocked into the city, bringing with them their sick and those who were troubled by foul spirits; and they were cured everyone. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  At this the high priest was roused to action, and he and all his supporters (who formed the party of the Sadducees), moved by jealousy,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  arrested the apostles, and had them placed in custody.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  An angel of the Lord, however, opened the prison doors at night and led them out.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Go,” he said, “and stand in the Temple Courts, and tell the people the whole message of this new life.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  When they heard this, they went at daybreak into the Temple Courts, and began to teach. The high priest and his party, on their arrival, summoned the High Council, including all the leaders of the people among the Israelites, and sent to the jail to fetch the apostles.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But, when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported that,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  while they had found the goal barred securely and the guards posted at the doors, yet, on opening them, they had not found anyone inside.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  When the officer in charge at the Temple and the chief priests heard their story, they were perplexed about the apostles and as to what all this would lead to.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Presently, however, someone came and told them, that the men whom they had put in prison were actually standing in the Temple Courts, teaching the people.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then, the officer went with his men and fetched the apostles – without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people –  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And then brought them before the Council. The high priest demanded an explanation from them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “We gave you strict orders,” he said, “not to teach in this name. Yet you have actually flooded Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to make us responsible for the death of this man.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  To this Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you put to death by hanging him on a cross.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  It is this Jesus whom God has exalted to his right hand, to be a guide and a Savior, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  And we are witness to the truth of this, and so is the Holy Spirit – the gift of God to those who obey him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  The members of the Council became frantic with rage on hearing this, and were for putting the apostles to death.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  But Gamaliel, a Pharisee, who was a Doctor of the Law and who was held in universal respect, rose in the Council, and directed that the men should be taken out of court for a little while. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  He then said, “People of Israel, take care as to what you intend to do with these men.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  For not long ago Theudas appeared, professing to be somebody, and was joined by a body of some four hundred men. But he was killed; and all his followers scattered and dwindled away.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  After him, Judas the Galilean appeared at the time of the census, and induced people to follow him; Yet he, too, perished and all his followers were dispersed.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  And, in this present case, my advice to you is not to interfere with these men, but to leave them alone, for, if their designs and their work are merely of human origin, they will come to an end;  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  but, if they are of divine origin, you will be powerless to put an end to them – or else you may find yourselves fighting against God!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  The Council followed his advice, and, calling the apostles in, had them flogged, and then, after cautioning them not to speak in the name of Jesus, set them free.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  But the apostles left the Council, rejoicing that they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for that name;  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  and never for a single day, either in the Temple Courts or in private houses, did they cease to teach, or to tell the good news of Jesus, the Christ. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 6]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The Twelve, therefore, called together the general body of the disciples and said to them, “It is not well for us to see to the distribution at the tables and neglect God’s message.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Therefore, friends, look for seven men of reputation among yourselves, wise and spiritually-minded men, and we will appoint them to attend to this matter;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the delivery of the message.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose Stephen – a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit – and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former convert to Judaism;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and they brought these men to the apostles, who, after praying, placed their hands on them. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So God’s message spread, and the number of the disciples continued to increase rapidly in Jerusalem, and a large body of the priests accepted the faith. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Meanwhile Stephen, divinely helped and strengthened, was showing great wonders and signs among the people.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But some members of the Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and Visitors from Cilicia and Roman Asia, were roused to action and began disputing with Stephen;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  yet they were quite unable to withstand the wisdom and the inspiration with which he spoke.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then they induced some men to assert that they had heard Stephen saying blasphemous things against Moses, and against God;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and they stirred up the people, as well as the elders and the teachers of the Law, and set on Stephen, and arrested him, and brought him before the High Council.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There they produced witnesses who gave false evidence. 

<p> “This man,” they said, “is incessantly saying things against this Holy place and the Law;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  indeed, we have heard him declare that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the customs handed down to us by Moses.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The eyes of all the members of the Council were riveted on Stephen, and they saw his face looking like the face of an angel. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Stephen replied, “Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him –  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ‘Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  God’s words were these – ‘Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,’ God said, ‘and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father’s house;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?’  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying – ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?’  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say –  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  ‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then the Lord said to him – ‘Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.’  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words – ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel – ‘God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.’  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  while they said to Aaron – ‘Make us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honor of their own handiwork!  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel, 

<p class="indent-2"> all those forty years in the desert? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  You took with you the tent where Moloch is worshiped 

<p class="indent-1"> and the star of the god Rephan – 

<p class="indent-2"> the images which you had made to worship. 

<p class="indent-3"> Therefore I will exile you beyond Babylon.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Our ancestors had the tent where they worshiped God in the desert, constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it, after the model which he had seen.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  This tent, which was handed down to them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their advance), and remained here until the time of David.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  David found favor with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place to reside.  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  But it was Solomon who built a house for God.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Yet it is not in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  ‘The heavens are a throne for me, 

<p class="indent-2"> and the earth a stool for my feet. 

<p class="indent-1"> What manner of house will you build me, asks the Lord, 

<p class="indent-2"> or what place is there where I may rest? 

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  Was it not my hand that made all these things?’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  Which of the prophets escaped persecution at their hands? They killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one; of whom you, in your turn, have now become the betrayers and murderers –  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  You who received the Law as transmitted by angels and yet failed to keep it.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  As they listened to this, the Council grew frantic with rage, and gnashed their teeth at Stephen.  <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  He, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes intently on the heavens, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right hand. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  “Look,” he exclaimed, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right hand!”  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  At this, with a loud shout, they stopped their ears and all rushed on him, forced him outside the city,  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  and began to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.  <span class="v-num">[59]</span>  And they stoned Stephen, while he cried to the Lord, “Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!”  <span class="v-num">[60]</span>  Falling on his knees, he called out loudly, “Lord! Do not charge them with this sin;” and with these words he fell asleep. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Saul approved of his being put to death. 

<p> On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house, dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. ‘This man,’ they used to say, ‘must be that power of God which people call “The Great Power.”’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  (As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus).  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  When Simon saw that it was through the placing of the apostles’ hands on them that the Spirit was given, he brought them a sum of money and said,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  “Give me also this power of yours, so that, if I place my hands on anyone, he may receive the Holy Spirit.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “A curse on you and on your money,” Peter exclaimed, “for thinking that God’s free gift can be bought with gold!  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  You have no share or part in our message, for your heart is not right with God.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, that, if possible, you may be forgiven for such a thought;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  for I see that you have fallen into the bitterness of envy and the fetters of sin.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  “Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,” Simon answered, “so that none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the Lord’s message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they went, in many Samaritan villages. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Meanwhile an angel of the Lord had said to Philip, “Set out on a journey southwards, along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (It is now deserted).  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So Philip set out on a journey; and on his way he came on an official of high rank, in the service of Candace, Queen of the Abyssinians. He was her treasurer, and had been to Jerusalem to worship,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and was now on his way home, sitting in his carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up to the carriage over there and keep close to it.”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  So Philip ran up, and he heard the Abyssinian reading the prophet Isaiah. 

<p> “Do you understand what you are reading?” he asked.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  “How can I,” the other answered, “unless someone will explain it to me?” and he invited Philip to get up and sit by his side.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  The passage of scripture which he was reading was this – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter, 

<p class="indent-2"> and as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer, 

<p class="indent-2"> so he refrains from opening his lips. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  He was humiliated and justice was denied him. 

<p class="indent-1"> Who will tell the story of his generation? 

<p class="indent-2"> For his life is cut off from earth.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “Now,” said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, “tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Then Philip began, and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, “Look! Here is water; what is to prevent my being baptized?”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: Philip said, “If you believe with your whole heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”  ] <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  So he ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water – both Philip and the Treasurer – and Philip baptized him.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful heart.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  But Philip was found at Ashdod, and, as he went on his way, he told the good news in all the towns through which he passed, until he came to Caesarea. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 9]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorizing him, if he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him –  <span class="woc"> “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “Who are you, Lord?” he asked. 

<p><span class="woc"> “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” </span>  the voice answered;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span> <span class="woc"> “Yet stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said,  <span class="woc"> “Ananias.” </span>

<p> “Yes, Lord,” he answered.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span> <span class="woc"> “Go at once,” </span>  said the Lord,  <span class="woc"> “to the Straight Street, and ask at Judas’s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying, </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  “Lord,” exclaimed Ananias, “I have heard from many people about this man – how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But the Lord said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel. </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said, “Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord – by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here – so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  All who heard him were amazed. 

<p> “Is not this,” they asked, “the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  “Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.” Aeneas got up at once;  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  and all the inhabitants of Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord’s side. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek ‘Dorcas’ – a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came around him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha! Stand up.” 

<p> She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ’s people, presented her to them alive.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  This became known all through Jaffa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  And Peter stayed some days at Jaffa with a tanner named Simon. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 10]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a captain in the regiment known as the ‘Italian Regiment,’  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  One afternoon, about three o’clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said, “What is it, Lord?” 

<p> “Your prayers and your charities,” the angel answered, “have been an acceptable offering to God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And now, send messengers to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Jaffa. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then he was aware of a voice which said –  <span class="woc"> “Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  “No, Lord, I cannot,” answered Peter, “for I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.”  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Again he was aware of a voice which said –  <span class="woc"> “What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.” </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon’s house, came up to the gate,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, “There are two men looking for you at this moment.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the person you are looking for. What is your reason for coming?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The men replied, “Our captain, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So Peter invited them in and entertained them. 

<p> The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Lord’s followers from Jaffa;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relatives and intimate friends to meet them.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter’s feet, bowed to the ground.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, “Stand up, I am only human like yourself.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  “Just three days ago this very hour,” Cornelius said, “I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  ‘Cornelius,’ he said, ‘your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Therefore send to Jaffa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.’  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.”  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Then Peter began. 

<p> “I see, beyond all doubt,” he said, “that God does not show partiality,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace – and Jesus is Lord of all!  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning form Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed –  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God – to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  To him it is that all the prophets bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives through his name forgiveness of sins.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even on the Gentiles;  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  for they heard them speaking in different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked,  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  “Can anyone refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?”  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  And he directed that they should be baptized in the faith of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 11]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God’s message.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  on the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had taken meals with them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So Peter began to relate the facts to them as they had occurred.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “I was in the town of Jaffa,” he said, “and was praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the heavens; and it came right down to me.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Looking intently at it, I began to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and I also heard a voice saying to me –  <span class="woc"> ‘Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  ‘No, Lord, I cannot,’ I answered, ‘for nothing defiled or unclean has ever passed my lips.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then a second time there came a voice from the heavens.  <span class="woc"> ‘What God has pronounced clean’, </span>  it said,  <span class="woc"> ‘you must not call defiled.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  At that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also went with me. And, when we came into the man’s house,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to him – ‘Send to Jaffa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to you and all your household.’  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I had but just begun to speak,” continued Peter, “when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the first;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and I recalled the saying of the Master –  <span class="woc"> ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master – who was I that I could thwart God?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  On hearing this statement, they said no more, but broke out into praise of God. “So even to the Gentiles,” they exclaimed, “God has granted the repentance which leads to life!” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message – but only to Jews.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord’s side.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  On coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to the Lord –  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith – and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord’s side.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Afterward Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and, when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And so it came about that, for a whole year, they attended the meetings of the church there, and taught a large number of people; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called ‘Christians.’

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  One of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world – a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  So the disciples, without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send something to help the followers living in Judea.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And this they did, sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 12]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the members of the church.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He had James, the brother of John, beheaded;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and, when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.)  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the Passover, to bring him up before the people.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So Peter was kept in prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly offered to God on his behalf.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Just when Herod was intending to bring him before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of the door, guarding the prison.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side, and roused him with the words, “Get up quickly.”  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The chains dropped from his wrists, and then the angel said, “Put on your belt and sandals.” When Peter had done so, the angel added, “Throw your cloak around you and follow me.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under the angel’s guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once the angel left him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know beyond all doubt that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod’s hands and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As soon as he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered together, praying.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On his knocking at the door in the gate, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  She recognized Peter’s voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them that Peter was standing outside. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “You are mad!” they exclaimed. But, when she persisted that it was so, they said, “It must be his spirit!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Peter signed to them with his hand to be silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, adding, “Tell James and the others all this.” Then he left the house, and went away to another place. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers – what could have become of Peter!  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And, when Herod had made further search for him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at Caesarea. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king’s for its food supply.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes, seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The people kept shouting, “It is the voice of God, and not of a person!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Meanwhile the Lord’s message kept extending, and spreading far and wide. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  When Barnabas and Saul had carried out their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, and took with them John, who was also known as Mark. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 13]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span> 

<h3>The Church and the Gentiles</h3>

<p>

<h5>Acts of the Apostle Paul</h5>

<p> Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several prophets and teachers – Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of ‘Black’, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and Saul.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  While they were engaged in the worship of the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.”  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Accordingly, after fasting and prayer, they placed their hands on them and dismissed them. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Barnabas and Saul, sent on this mission, as they were, by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  On reaching Salamis, they began to tell the message of God in the Jewish synagogues; and they had John with them as an assistant.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After passing through the whole island, they reached Paphos, where they found an astrologer who pretended to be a prophet – a Jew by birth, whose name was Barjoshua.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He was at the court of the Governor, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked to be told God’s message.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But Elymas, the astrologer (for that is the meaning of the word), opposed them, eager to divert the Governor’s attention from the faith.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him and said,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “You incarnation of deceit and all fraud! You son of the devil! You opponent of all that is good! Will you never cease to divert the straight paths of the Lord? Listen!  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The hand of the Lord is on you even now, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the sun.” Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went feeling about for someone to guide him.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When the Governor saw what had happened, he became a believer in Christ, being greatly impressed by the teaching about the Lord. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  After this, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and went to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The others went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and took their seats.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  After the reading of the Law and the prophets, the synagogue leader sent them this message – “Friends, if you have any helpful words to address to the people, now is the time to speak.”  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So Paul rose and, motioning with his hand, said: 

<p> “People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to say.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For about forty years he bore with them in the desert;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people –  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For about four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of whom the prophet Samuel was the last.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And, when they demanded a king, God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  After removing him, he raised David to the throne, and bore this testimony to him – ‘In David, the son of Jesse, I have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my purposes.’  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  It was from this man’s descendants that God, in accordance with his promise, gave Israel a Savior – Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  John having first proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for all the people of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  As John was drawing towards the end of his career, he said ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But there is “one coming” after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.’  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, and all those among you who worship God, it was to us that the message of this salvation was sent.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The people of Jerusalem and their leaders, failing to recognize Jesus, and not understanding the utterances of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  They found no ground at all for putting him to death, and yet demanded his execution from Pilate;  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  and, after carrying out everything written about him, they took Jesus down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But God raised him from the dead;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are now witnesses for him to the people.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  We also have good news to tell you, about the promise made to our ancestors –  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  That our children have had this promise completely fulfilled to them by God, by his raising Jesus. That is just what is said in the second Psalm – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to corruption, this is what is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  And, therefore, in another Psalm it is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You will not give up the Holy One to undergo corruption.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  David, after obediently doing God’s will in his own time, fell asleep and was laid by the side of his ancestors, and did undergo corruption;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  but Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, did not undergo corruption.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  I would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  and that, in union with him, everyone who believes in him is absolved from every sin from which under the Law of Moses you could not be absolved.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Beware, therefore, that what is said in the prophets does not come true of you – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  ‘Look, you despisers, and wonder, and perish; 

<p class="indent-1"> for I am doing a deed in your days – 

<p class="indent-2"> a deed which, though told you in full, you will never believe’.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged for a repetition of this teaching on the next Sabbath.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  After the congregation had dispersed, many of the Jews, and of the converts who joined in their worship, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue to rely on the loving kindness of God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  On the following Sabbath, almost all the city gathered to hear God’s message.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  But the sight of the crowds of people filled the minds of the Jews with jealousy, and they kept contradicting Paul’s statements in violent language.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out fearlessly, and said: 

<p> “It was necessary that the message of God should be told to you first; but, since you reject it and reckon yourselves not worthy of the eternal life – we turn to the Gentiles!  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  For this is the Lord’s command to us – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles, 

<p class="indent-1"> a means of salvation to the ends of the earth’.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  On hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and extolled God’s message; and all those who had been enrolled for eternal life became believers in Christ;  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  and the Lord’s message was carried throughout that district.  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  But the Jews incited the women of high social standing who worshiped with them, and the leading men of the town, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  They, however, shook the dust off their feet in protest,  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  and went to Iconium, leaving the disciples full of joy and of the Holy Spirit. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 14]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the Lord’s followers.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there, and spoke out fearlessly, relying on the Lord, who confirmed the message of his love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their hands.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some with the apostles;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to stone them,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  the apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district around,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and there they continued to tell the good news. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  said loudly, “Stand upright on your feet.” 

<p> The man leaped up, and began walking about,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language, “The Gods have come down to us in human form.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So they called Barnabas ‘Zeus,’ and Paul ‘Hermes,’ because he took the lead in speaking;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and the priest of Zeus-beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd. 

<p> “Friends, why are you doing this?” they shouted.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  “We are only people like yourselves, and we have come with the good news that you should turn away from these follies to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In bygone times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself – sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Even with this appeal they could hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But, when the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  After telling the good news throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  They also appointed elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  and, after telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  From there they sailed to Antioch – the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  After their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 15]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord’s followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Some of the Pharisees’ party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After much discussion, Peter rose and said: 

<p> “You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out – that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council. 

<p> “Friends,” he began, “hear what I have to say.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his name.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  ‘After this I will return; 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen – 

<p class="indent-1"> Its ruins I will rebuild, 

<p class="indent-2"> And will set it up once more; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  That so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord – 

<p class="indent-1"> Even all the Gentiles on whom my name has been bestowed. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  They were bearers of the following letter – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds – without instructions from us –  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions –  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: But Silas decided to stay.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord’s message.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the Lord’s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord’s message, and see how they are prospering.”  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 16]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and who was well spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and there one night Paul saw a vision. A Macedonian was standing and appealing to him – ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had summoned us to tell the good news to the people there. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  From there we made our way to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and also a Roman Settlement. 

<p> In that city we spent several days.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman’s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and, when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us to become her guests. 

<p> “Since you have shown your conviction,” she said, “that I really am a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she insisted on our doing so. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her masters by fortune-telling.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, calling, “These men are servants of the most high God, and they are bringing you news of a way to salvation.”  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.” That very moment the spirit left her. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and took them before the Magistrates. 

<p> “These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,” they complained;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  On receiving so strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured their feet in the stocks.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening to them,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the prisoners’ chains were loosened.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Roused from his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But Paul called our loudly, “Do not harm yourself; we are all here.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then he led them out, and said, “What must I do to be saved?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  “Believe in Jesus, our Lord,” they replied, “and you will be saved, you and your household too.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Then they spoke to him of God’s message, and to all his household as well.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  And that very hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging to him were baptized without delay.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Afterward he took them up to his house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all his household, had come to believe in God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  In the morning the Magistrates sent the police with an order for the men to be discharged.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  The jailer told Paul of his instructions. “The Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,” he said, “so you had better leave the place at once and go quietly away.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  But Paul’s answer to them was, “They have flogged us in public without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let them come and take us out themselves.”  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  The police reported his words to the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, were alarmed,  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  and went to the prison, and did their best to conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the city.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, and, after they had seen the Lord’s followers, and encouraged them, they left the place. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 17]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ – this Jesus about whom I am telling you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord’s followers before the city magistrates, shouting out, 

<p> “These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and have been harbored by Jason! They are all defying the decrees of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king – a man called Jesus!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus. 

<p> “May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  (All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said – “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription – ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The God who made the world and all things that are in it – he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  He made all races of the earth’s surface – fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements –  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘His offspring, too, are we.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone – a work of human art and imagination.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed – and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  And so Paul left the Court.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them – their trade was tent-making.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision,  <span class="woc"> “Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced; </span> <span class="v-num">[10]</span> <span class="woc"> for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.” </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, “If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  as he took his leave, “I will come back again to you, please God,” and then set sail from Ephesus.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 19]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?” 

<p> “No,” they answered, “we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “What then was your baptism?” Paul asked.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  “John’s baptism was a baptism on repentance,” rejoined Paul, “and John told the people (speaking of the ‘one coming’ after him) that they should believe in him – that is in Jesus.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  On hearing this, they were baptized into the faith of the Lord Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  There were about twelve of them in all. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord’s message. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul’s hands;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them. 

<p> “I order you,” they would say, “by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but the wicked spirit answered them, “Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you – who are you?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them, mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honor.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  So irresistibly did the Lord’s message spread and prevail. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. “And after I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  So he sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Roman Asia. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  got these men together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and said: 

<p> “Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at all.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendor – though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Paul wished to go into the amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself inside.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing why they had met.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to show that he wanted to speak in their defense to the people.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  However, when they recognized him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they continued shouting for two hours – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said, “People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis, and of the statue which fell down from Zeus?  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash;  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  for you have brought these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor blasphemers of our Goddess.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal proceedings.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled in the regular Assembly.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  For I tell you that we are in danger of being proceeded against for today’s riot, there being nothing to account for it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this disorderly gathering.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  With these words he dismissed the Assembly. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 20]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with encouraging words, bade them goodbye, and started on his journey to Macedonia.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  After going through those districts and speaking many encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed three months.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he decided to return by way of Macedonia.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of Roman Asia.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  These people went to Troas and waited for us there;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  while we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  There were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked up for dead.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms around him. 

<p> “Do not be alarmed,” he said, “he is still alive.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then he went upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with them at great length until daybreak, and then left.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Meanwhile they had taken the lad away alive, and were greatly comforted. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement, as he intended to go by land himself.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The day after we had sailed from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day, and the next day reached Miletus;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  for Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of the Harvest. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church elders to meet him;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and, when they came, he said to them, “You know well the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set foot in Roman Asia,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of the Jewish leaders.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I never shrank from telling you anything that could be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And now, under spiritual constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  except that in town after town the Holy Spirit plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But I count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus – which was to declare the good news of the love of God.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And now, I tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again – you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Therefore I declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the fate of any of you,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole purpose of God regarding you.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Be watchful over yourselves, and over the whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his life.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  and from among yourselves, too, people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw away the disciples after them.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Therefore, be on your guard, remembering how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to warn each one of you.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  And now I commend you to the Lord and to the message of his love – a message which has the power to build up your characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become Christ’s people.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  I have never coveted anyone’s gold or silver or clothing.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not only for my own wants, but for my companions also.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  I left nothing undone to show you that, laboring as I labored, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself –  <span class="woc"> ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” </span> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  All were in tears; and throwing their arms around Paul’s neck, they kissed him again and again,  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  grieving most of all over what he had said – that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 21]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set sail.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and then said goodbye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned home. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and exchanged greetings with the followers there, and spent a day with them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip, the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  During our visit, which lasted several days, a prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He came to see us, and, taking Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands with it, said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says – ‘The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, and they will give him up to the Gentiles’.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When we heard that, we and the people of the place began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  It was then that Paul made the reply, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only adding – “The Lord’s will be done.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on our way up to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing, with whom we were to stay.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  On our arrival at Jerusalem, the followers of the Lord there gave us a hearty welcome;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and the next day Paul went with us to see James, and all the church elders were present.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  After greeting them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and, when they had heard it, they began praising God, and said to Paul: 

<p> “You see, brother, that those of our people who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification, and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on behalf of each of them. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the Jewish people from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul and shouting,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “People of Israel! Help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our Law, and this place; and, what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this sacred place.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in Paul’s company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had taken him into the Temple.) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were immediately shut.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  They were bent on killing him, when it was reported to the officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in commotion.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  He instantly got together some officers and soldiers, and charged down on the crowd, who, when they saw the commanding officer and his soldiers, stopped beating Paul.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Then he went up to Paul, arrested him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he was, and what he had been doing.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Some of the crowd said one thing, and some another; and, as he could get no definite reply because of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  When Paul reached the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the violence of the mob;  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  for the people were following in a mass, shouting out, “Kill him!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the commanding officer, “May I speak to you?” 

<p> “Do you know Greek?” asked the commanding officer.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  “Aren’t you, then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the four thousand Bandits out into the wilderness?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  “No,” said Paul, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city of some note. I beg you to give me permission to speak to the people.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew: 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 22]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  “Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I am about to make.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on: 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God’s service as any of you who are here today.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all around me.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ </span> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I replied. Then the voice said  <span class="woc"> ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker’s voice.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then I said ‘What am I to do, Lord?’  <span class="woc"> ‘Get up and go into Damascus,’ </span>  The Lord said to me,  <span class="woc"> ‘and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Standing close to me, he said ‘Saul, my brother, recover your sight.’ And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then he said ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And now why wait any longer, Be baptized at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.’  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and saw Jesus saying to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  ‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But Jesus said to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away’.” </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, “Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the captain standing near, “Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  On hearing this, the captain went and reported it to the commanding officer. “Do you know what you are doing?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” 

<p> “Yes,” replied Paul.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  “I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,” said the officer. “I am one by birth,” rejoined Paul. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 23]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began: 

<p> “Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.”  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Paul turned to him and said: 

<p> “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The people standing near said to Paul, “Do you know that you are insulting God’s high priest?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,” said Paul, “for scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill’.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  (For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.)  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested, “We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel…”  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Courage! You have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome also.” </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There were more than forty in the plot;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and they went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  However, the son of Paul’s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Paul called one of the Captains of the garrison and asked him to take the lad to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The captain went with the lad to the commanding officer, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this lad to you, as he has something to tell you.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The commanding officer took the lad by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  “Some men have agreed,” answered the lad, “to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.”  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o’clock that night,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He also wrote a letter along these lines: 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  ‘Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the Governor.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  when I found that their charges were connected with questions of their own Law, and that there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris;  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and on the next day, leaving the troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  On arriving at Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought Paul before him.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he said,  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  “I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have arrived.” And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s Government house. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 24]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Five days afterward the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and, when the hearing came on, Tertullus began his speech for the prosecution.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  “We owe it to your Excellency,” he said, “that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms – advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But – not to be tedious – I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a brief statement of our case.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  We have found this man a public pest; he is one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a ringleader of the Nazarene heretics.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He even attempted to desecrate the Temple itself, but we caught him;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: We wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias the commanding officer came and took him out of our hands by force, ordering his accusers to come before you.  ] <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and you will be able, by examining him on all these points, to satisfy yourself as to the charges which we are bringing against him.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his statements.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply: 

<p> “Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defense.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  where my prosecutors never found me holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect – either in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and they cannot establish the charges which they are now making against me.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and I have a hope that rests in God – a hope which they also cherish – that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This being so, I strive at all times to keep my conscience clear before both God and people.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me –  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Or else let my opponents here say what they found wrong in me when I was before the Council,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  except as to the one sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them – ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today’.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Felix, however, adjourned the case – though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way – with the promise, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.”  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So he gave orders to the captain in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But, while Paul was speaking at length about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified, and interrupted him – “Go for the present, but, when I find an opportunity, I will send for you again.”  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  He was hoping, too, for a bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with him.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left Paul a prisoner. 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 25]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There the chief priests and the leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and asked a favor of him, to Paul’s injury – to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the road.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  “So let the influential men among you,” he said, “go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.”  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  On Paul’s appearance, the Jewish leaders who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious charges, which they failed to establish.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Paul’s answer to the charge was – ‘I have not committed any offense against the Jewish Law, or the Temple, or the Emperor.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “No,” replied Paul, “I am standing at the Emperor’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offense deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, “You have appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and paid a visit of congratulation to Festus;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king. “There is a man here,” he said, “left a prisoner by Felix,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an information, demanding judgment against him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  “I should like to hear this man myself,” Agrippa said to Festus. 

<p> “You will hear him tomorrow,” Festus answered. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought before them.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all here present, you see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to be allowed to live.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  I found, however, that he had not done anything deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I decided to send him.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But I have nothing definite to write about him to my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him, I may have something to write.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against him.” 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 26]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, “You are at liberty to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  “I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,” he said, “that it is before you that I have to make my defense today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and they have always known – if they choose to give evidence – that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused – and by Jews themselves!  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all around me and those traveling with me.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew –  <span class="woc"> ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. And the Lord said,  <span class="woc"> ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you, </span> <span class="v-num">[17]</span> <span class="woc"> since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God’s people, by faith in me.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike – without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen –  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  While Paul was making this defense, Festus called out loudly, “You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  “I am not mad, your Excellency,” he replied. “On the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But Agrippa said to Paul, “You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  “Whether it is soon or late,” answered Paul, “I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself – except for these chains!”  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. “There is nothing,” they said, “deserving death or imprisonment in this man’s conduct”;  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, “The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.” 

<p class="c-num">[Acts 27]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavorable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called ‘Fair Havens,’ near which was the town of Lasea. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “My friends,” he said, “I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And, as the harbor was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favor of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbor, open to the north-east and south-east.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But shortly afterward a hurricane came down on us off the land – a north-easter, as it is called.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship’s boat,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and, on the following day, threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said, “My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Yet, even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you – only the ship.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said –  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  ‘Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers.’  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Therefore, courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  We will, however, have to be driven on some island.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretense of running out anchors from the bows,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, “Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.”  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat. 

<p> “It is a fortnight today,” he said, “that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The island’s people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  There we found some of the Lord’s followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said, “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor – not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  “We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and from the prophets – speaking from morning until evening.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only – 

<p> “True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Go to this nation and say: 

<p class="indent-2"> You will hear with your ears without ever understanding, 

<p class="indent-3"> and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For the mind of this nation has grown dense, 

<p class="indent-3"> And their ears are dull of hearing, 

<p class="indent-3"> Their eyes also have they closed; 

<p class="indent-2"> Otherwise some day they might see with their eyes, 

<p class="indent-2"> And with their ears they might hear, 

<p class="indent-2"> And in their mind they might understand, and might turn – 

<p class="indent-3"> And I might heal them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles; and they will listen.”  <span class="v-num">[29]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: After he said these things the Jews left, all the while engaging in a heated debate among themselves.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unhindered.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Romans</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Romans 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations. 

<h5>Faith the Ground of Acceptance</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  will fall on every human being who persists in wrong-doing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  since God shows no partiality.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For, as scripture says – ‘The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you’!  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But what if our wrong-doing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Otherwise how can God judge the world? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  As scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘There is not even one who is righteous, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  not one who understands, 

<p class="indent-2"> not one who is searching for God! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  They have all gone astray; 

<p class="indent-2"> they have one and all become depraved; 

<p class="indent-3"> there is no one who is doing good – no, not one!’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  ‘Their throats are like opened graves; 

<p class="indent-2"> they deceive with their tongues.’ 

<p class="indent-1"> ‘The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,’ 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  ‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’ 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  ‘Swift are their feet to shed blood. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Distress and trouble dog their steps, 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and the path of peace they do not know.’ 

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  ‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’ 

<p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  ‘Blessed are those whose wrong-doings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  as scripture says – ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words – ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Now these words – ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ – were not written with reference to Abraham only;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offenses, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  in order than, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 6]</p>

<h5>Difficulties arising from this Teaching</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Surely you know that, when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service sin which leads to death, or a service Duty which leads to righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the Commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The Commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  sin took advantage of the Commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so the Law is holy, and each Commandment is also holy, and just, and good.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the Commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  At heart I delight in the Law of God;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  They who are earthly cannot please God.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  All who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a son which leads us to cry ‘Abba, Our Father.’  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  All Nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For Nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  yet not without the hope that some day Nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  We know, indeed, that all Nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And not Nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  What are we to say, then, in the light of all this? 

<p><p class="indent-1"> If God is on our side, who can there be against us? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf! 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Scripture says – ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us!  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord! 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 9]</p>

<h5>Gentiles and Jews</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as sons, the visible presence, the Covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the Promises.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  They are descended from the Patriarchs; and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the Promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  that the elder would be a servant to the younger.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I might rather ask ‘Who are you who are arguing with God?’ Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it ‘Why did you make me like this?’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and whom he called – even us – Not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also!  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – ‘Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And in the place where it was said to them – “You are not my people”, they will be called sons of the living God.’  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – ‘Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape!  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.’  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  It is as Isaiah foretold – ‘Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  As scripture says – ‘See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 10]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ (which means to bring Christ down)  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  ‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  No, but what does it say? ‘The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart’ (which means ‘The Message of faith’ which we proclaim).  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of faith and so find salvation.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As the passage of scripture says – ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for – ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand?’ First there is Moses, who says – ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And Isaiah says boldly – ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But of the people of Israel he says – ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The rest grew callous; as scripture says – ‘God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  David, too, says – ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I ask then – ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If the first handful of dough in holy, so is the whole mass; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  True; it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognize the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And they will see the fulfillment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.’  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the Patriarchs.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For God never regrets his gifts or his call.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Who has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.

<h5>Advice on Daily Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Rather – ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Let everyone obey the supreme Authorities. For no Authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing Authorities have been appointed by God.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Therefore he who sets himself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the Law.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, You must not kill, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us have done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 14]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  One person’s faith permits of their eating food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For scripture says – ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.”’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 15]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And again it says – ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And yet again – ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Again, Isaiah says – ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  But as scripture says – ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’ 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When I have settled this matter, and have secured to the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen. 

<p class="c-num">[Romans 16]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is an assistant of the church at Cenchreae;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  to Mary, who worked hard for you;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  to Urban, our fellow worker in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  to that proved Christian Apelles; to the household of Aristobulus;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  to my countryman Herodion; to the Christians in the household of Narcissus;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  to that eminent Christian, Rufus, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me also;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and our friends with them;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all Christ’s people who are with them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For such persons are not serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and, by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good, and innocent of all that is bad.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet. 

<p> May the blessing of Jesus, our Lord, be with you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, send theirs. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  I Tertius, who am writing this letter, send you my Christian greeting. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  My host Gaius, who extends his hospitality to the whole church, sends you his greeting; and Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus, our dear friend, add theirs.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span> [Note:        Some later manuscripts add: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.  ]

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past ages was kept secret but now has been revealed  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and, in obedience to the command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith –  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  to him, I say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<h2>Paul’s First Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Corinthians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. 

<h5>The State of the Church at Corinth</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the faith of Paul?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  so that no one can say that you were baptized into my faith.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  so that in his presence no one should boast.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  so that – in the words of scripture – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!’ 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ – and him crucified!  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It is what scripture speaks of as – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard, 

<p class="indent-1"> what never entered people’s minds – 

<p class="indent-2"> even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it. 

<p> No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And it says again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours!  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit? 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 6]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Don’t you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God! 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 7]</p>

<h5>Answers to Questions Asked by the Church at Corinth</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  (If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter around your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ –  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died!  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The defense that I make to my critics is this:  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Haven’t we a right to food and drink?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For in the Law of Moses it is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You should not muzzle a bullock while it is treading out the grain.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the plowman ought not to plow, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If I tell the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not tell it!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  I, therefore, run with no uncertain aim. I box – not like a man hitting the air.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 10]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and that they all ate the same supernatural food,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 11]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonors him who is his head;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonors him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  To begin with, I hear you and, to some extent, I believe it.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Indeed, there must be actual parties among you, for so only will the people of real worth become known.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said  <span class="woc"> “This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying  <span class="woc"> “This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.” </span> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offense against the Lord’s body and blood.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and those parts which we deem less honorable we surround with special honor; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honor to the part that lacks it –  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honor done it, all the others share its joy.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them?  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Strive for the greater gifts.

<p> Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 13]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 14]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ should pray for ability to interpret them.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  It is said in the Law – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  (The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 15]</p>

<h5>The Apostle’s Teaching as to the Resurrection of the Dead</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still!  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  The last enemy to be overthrown is death;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Do not be deceived. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Good character is marred by evil company.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Someone, however, may ask ‘How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?’  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies!  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.  <span class="v-num">[41]</span>  There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.  <span class="v-num">[42]</span>  It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;  <span class="v-num">[43]</span>  sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.  <span class="v-num">[44]</span>  As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.  <span class="v-num">[45]</span>  That is what is meant by the words – ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  <span class="v-num">[46]</span>  That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterward comes the spiritual;  <span class="v-num">[47]</span>  the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[48]</span>  Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[49]</span>  And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[50]</span>  This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.  <span class="v-num">[51]</span>  Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,  <span class="v-num">[52]</span>  at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.  <span class="v-num">[53]</span>  For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.  <span class="v-num">[54]</span>  And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[55]</span>  ‘death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[56]</span>  It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.  <span class="v-num">[57]</span>  But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[58]</span>  Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Corinthians 16]</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.

<h2>Paul’s Second Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Corinthians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers. 

<h5>The Apostle’s Relations with his Converts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’!  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So I entreat you to assure him of your love.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts. 

<h5>The Ministry of the Apostles</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  (For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 5]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the Ministry of Reconciliation –  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 6]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For he says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘At the time for acceptance I listened to you, 

<p class="indent-1"> And on the day of deliverance I helped you.’ 

<p> Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things! 

<h5>The Apostle and his Converts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will live among them, and walk among them; 

<p class="indent-2"> And I will be their God, and they will be my people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord, 

<p class="indent-1"> “And touch nothing impure; 

<p class="indent-2"> And I will welcome you; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,” 

<p class="indent-2"> says the Lord, the Ruler of all.’ 

<p>

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 7]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 8]</p>

<h5>The Palestine Famine Fund</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  As scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did not lack!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honor of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  With reference, indeed, to the Fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Remember the saying – ‘Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  (As scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘He scattered broadcast, he gave to the poor; His righteousness continues for ever.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  All thanks to God for his inestimable gift! 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 10]</p>

<h5>The Apostle’s Claims and Authority</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” –  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 11]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I engaged you to one husband so that I might present you to the Christ a pure bride.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either!  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 12]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But his reply has been –  <span class="woc"> ‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’ </span>

<p> Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong! 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Corinthians 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognize this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But I hope that you will recognize that we can stand the test.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Greet one another with a sacred kiss.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  All Christ’s people here send you their greetings. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Galatians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and from all the followers of the Lord here.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of God and Father,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed! 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ. 

<h5>The Independence of the Apostle’s Gospel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  (As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  all that they had heard was – ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And they praised God for my sake. 

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Fourteen years afterward I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?” 

<h5>The Law and the Gospel</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  We, though we are Jews by birth and not outcasts of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be outcasts, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die! 

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 3]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  It is just as it was with Abraham – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the Law, and do it.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance. 

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My point is this – As long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  To ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – ‘Abba, our Father.’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years!  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  (The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  For scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Rejoice, you barren one, who does never bear, 

<p class="indent-1"> Break into shouts, you who are never in labor, 

<p class="indent-2"> For many are the children of her who is desolate – 

<p class="indent-3"> aye, more than of her who has a husband.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  But what does the passage of scripture say? 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave’s son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free. 

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 5]</p>

<h5>The Gospel in the Daily Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  A little leaven leavens all the dough.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle!  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence, but serve one another in a loving spirit.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Against such things there is no law!  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another. 

<p class="c-num">[Galatians 6]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  for everyone must bear their own load.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the Household of the faith. 

<h5>Conclusion in the Apostle’s own handwriting</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Those who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances are the people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised; and they do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Ephesians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory. 

<h5>The power of God displayed in Christ, the Head of the Church</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence. 

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  even though we were dead because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘the Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘the Circumcised’ – circumcised only by human hands!  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the Covenants founded on God’s Promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s Household.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the corner-stone.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit. 

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 3]</p>

<h5>The Apostle’s Divine Commission to the Gentiles</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen. 

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 4]</p>

<h5>The Gospel and Daily Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  That is why it is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  and give no opportunity to the devil.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.  <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you. 

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 5]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore have nothing to do with such people.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Sleeper, awake! 

<p class="indent-1"> Arise from the dead, 

<p class="indent-2"> And the Christ will give you light!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Savior of his body.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  for we are members of his body. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband. 

<p class="c-num">[Ephesians 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  ‘Honor your father and mother’ – this is the first Commandment with a promise –  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ‘so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breast-plate,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the Master’s cause, will tell you everything.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower peace, and love linked with faith.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  May God’s blessing be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Philippians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Philippians 1]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And what I pray for is this – that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still. 

<p class="c-num">[Philippians 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I entreat you to make my happiness complete – Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and you must also rejoice and share my joy.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me. 

<p class="c-num">[Philippians 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as refuse, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body. 

<p class="c-num">[Philippians 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honor have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong!  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Colossians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Colossians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, also a follower of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light. 

<h5>The Person and Work of the Christ</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his love,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – first-born and head of all creation;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The first-born from the dead, he is to the church the Source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  But now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  That truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – ‘Christ among you! Your hope of glory!’  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me. 

<p class="c-num">[Colossians 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Take care there is not someone who will carry you away by his ‘philosophy’ – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called ‘humility’ and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  to such ordinances as ‘Do not handle, or taste, or touch’?  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature. 

<p class="c-num">[Colossians 3]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. 

<h5>The Gospel in the Daily Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality. 

<p class="c-num">[Colossians 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains!  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Give this message to Archippus – ‘Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master’s cause.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God’s blessing be with you.

<h2>Paul’s First Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Thessalonians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 Thessalonians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace. 

<h5>The Apostle and his Converts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Thessalonians 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  You are our pride and our delight! 

<p class="c-num">[1 Thessalonians 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Thessalonians 4]</p>

<h5>Advice on Daily Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For God’s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia. 

<p> Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything. 

<h5>The Dead in Christ at the coming of the Lord</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterward we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Thessalonians 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For you all are children of light and children of the day. 

<p> We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord’s service, and give you counsel.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We entreat you also, friends – warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Always be joyful;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  never cease to pray;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Do not quench the Spirit;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  do not make light of preaching.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  shun every form of evil.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Friends, pray for us. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Greet all the Lord’s followers with a sacred kiss.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  I order you in the Lord’s name to have this letter read to all the brethren. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

<h2>Paul’s Second Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Thessalonians</h1>

<p class="c-num">[2 Thessalonians 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<h5>The Apostle and his Converts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin – banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  when he comes to be honored in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) – as he will be on that day.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honored in you, and you in him. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Thessalonians 2]</p>

<h5>Events that must precede the Lord’s Coming</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  not lightly to let your minds become unsettled, or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message, or by any letter, purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Do not let anyone deceive you, whatever he may do. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of that Incarnation of Wickedness, that Lost Soul,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret; but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then will ‘Wickedness Incarnate’ appear, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his lips, and annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For at the coming of the Lord there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Thessalonians 3]</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

<h2>Paul’s First Letter to</h2>

<h1>Timothy</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for the immoral, for perverts, for slave-dealers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’! And there is no greater sinner than I!  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterward to believe on him and attain eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 2]</p>

<h5>General Directions on Church Matters</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all. 

<p> This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Adam was formed first, not Eve.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  How true is this saying:  ‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  they should provide for own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus. 

<h5>Special Directions to Timothy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the Household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘He was revealed in our nature, 

<p class="indent-2"> Pronounced righteous in spirit, 

<p class="indent-3"> Seen by angels, 

<p class="indent-1"> Proclaimed among the Gentiles, 

<p class="indent-2"> Believed on in the world, 

<p class="indent-3"> Taken up into glory.’ 

<p>

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Remember these things in your teaching.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The words of scripture are – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You should not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> and again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"><span class="woc"> ‘The worker is worth their wages.’ </span>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrong-doing of others. Keep your life pure.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Timothy 6]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5> Those are the things to insist on in your teaching. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarreling, recriminations, base suspicions,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment!  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  So, with food and shelter, we will be content.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honor and power for ever. Amen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall ‘theology,’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> God bless you all.

<h2>Paul’s Second Letter to</h2>

<h1>Timothy</h1>

<p class="c-num">[2 Timothy 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and Immortality to light by that good news,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  of which I was myself appointed a herald and apostle, and teacher.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Timothy 2]</p>

<h5>Injunctions to Timothy</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  How true this saying is – ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS’; 

<p> and this – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Timothy 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind. 

<p class="c-num">[2 Timothy 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Do your utmost to come to me soon;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  You must also on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to</h2>

<h1>Titus</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Titus 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  – and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace. 

<h5>Mission of Titus in Crete</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work. 

<p class="c-num">[Titus 2]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you. 

<p class="c-num">[Titus 3]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  But, when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Let all our people learn to devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their lives may not be unfruitful. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting to our friends in the faith. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> God bless you all.

<h2>Paul’s Letter to</h2>

<h1>Philemon</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Philemon 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. 

<h5>Request regarding runaway slave</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s People have been cheered, friend, by you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers. 

<h5>Messages and Blessing</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

<h2>The Letter to the</h2>

<h1>Hebrews</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 1]</p>

<h5>Christ the Mediator</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he took his seat at the right hand of God’s Majesty on high,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For to which of the angels did God ever say – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’? 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> or again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son’? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Speaking of the angels, he said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘He makes the winds his angels 

<p class="indent-2"> And the flames of fire his servants’; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  while of the Son he said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘God is your throne for ever and ever; 

<p class="indent-2"> The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  You love righteousness and hates iniquity; 

<p class="indent-2"> Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth, 

<p class="indent-1"> and the heavens are the work of your hands. 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They will perish, but you remain; 

<p class="indent-1"> as a garment they will all grow old; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  As a mantle you will fold them up, 

<p class="indent-1"> and as a garment they will be changed, 

<p class="indent-2"> but you are the same, and your years will know no end.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  To which of the angels has God ever said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Sit you at my right hand 

<p class="indent-2"> until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’? 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation? 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  No; a writer has declared somewhere – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them? 

<p class="indent-2"> Or human beings that you should care for them? 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  You have made them, for a while, lower than angels; 

<p class="indent-2"> With glory and honor you have crowned them; 

<p class="indent-1"> You have set them over all that your hands have made; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  You have placed all things beneath their feet.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  He says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters, 

<p class="indent-1"> In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> And yet again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 3]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘If today you hear God’s voice, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me 

<p class="indent-2"> On the day when they tried my patience in the desert, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Where your ancestors tried my forbearance, 

<p class="indent-2"> And saw my mighty deeds for forty years. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation, 

<p class="indent-1"> And I said – “Their hearts are always straying; 

<p class="indent-2"> They have never learned my ways”; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  While in my wrath I swore – 

<p class="indent-2"> “They will never enter upon my rest.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  To use the words of scripture – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘If today you hear God’s voice, 

<p class="indent-1"> Harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 4]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘In my wrath I swore – 

<p class="indent-2"> “They will never enter upon my rest;”’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> Although God’s work was finished at the creation of the world;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘God rested on the seventh day after all his work.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  On the other hand, we read in that passage – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘They will never enter upon my rest.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘If today you hear God’s voice 

<p class="indent-1"> Harden not your hearts.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 5]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’; 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and on another occasion also – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 6]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Yes and, with God’s help, we will.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  His words were – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 7]</p>

<h5>Paramount Priesthood of the Christ</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for that is the meaning of the declaration – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  (for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord has sworn, and will not change, “You are a priest for all time.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  (These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But, finding fault with the people, God says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord, 

<p class="indent-2"> “When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah – 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors 

<p class="indent-2"> On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. 

<p class="indent-1"> For they did not abide by their covenant with me, 

<p class="indent-2"> And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  “This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel 

<p class="indent-2"> After those days,” says the Lord. 

<p class="indent-1"> “I will impress my laws on their minds, 

<p class="indent-2"> And will inscribe them on their hearts; 

<p class="indent-1"> And I will be their God, 

<p class="indent-2"> And they will be my people. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen, 

<p class="indent-2"> Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’; 

<p class="indent-1"> For everyone will know me, 

<p class="indent-2"> From the lowest to the highest. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings, 

<p class="indent-2"> And I will no longer remember their sins.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 9]</p>

<h5>The New Revelation and the Old</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  saying, as he did so – “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 10]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body; 

<p class="indent-2"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  So I said, “See, I have come” (as is written of me in the pages of the book), 

<p class="indent-2"> “To do your will, God.”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  First come the words – ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the Law),  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and then there is added – ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  ‘“This is the covenant that I will make with them 

<p class="indent-2"> After those days,” says the Lord; 

<p class="indent-1"> “I will impress my laws on their hearts, 

<p class="indent-2"> And will inscribe them on their minds,”’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  then we have – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin. 

<h5>Encouragement and Warning</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  by the way which he inaugurated for us – a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and, since we have in him ‘a great priest set over the house of God,’  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  When someone disregarded the Law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  We know who it was that said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘It is for me to avenge, I will requite’; 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> and again – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord will judge his people.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  ‘For there is indeed but a very little while 

<p class="indent-2"> Ere He who is coming will have come, without delay; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  And through faith the righteous will find life, 

<p class="indent-2"> But, if anyone draws back, my heart can find no pleasure in them.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Faith is the realization of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterward to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for child-bearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous ‘as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only aliens and strangers on the earth.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  of whom it had been said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘It is through Isaac that there will be descendants to bear your name.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and ‘to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.’  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of ‘son of a daughter of Pharaoh.’  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  For he counted ‘the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ’ of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.  <span class="v-num">[30]</span>  Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.  <span class="v-num">[31]</span>  Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[32]</span>  Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.  <span class="v-num">[33]</span>  By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,  <span class="v-num">[34]</span>  quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.  <span class="v-num">[35]</span>  Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.  <span class="v-num">[36]</span>  Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.  <span class="v-num">[37]</span>  They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –  <span class="v-num">[38]</span>  people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.  <span class="v-num">[39]</span>  Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfillment of God’s promise;  <span class="v-num">[40]</span>  since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us. 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 12]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘My child, think not lightly of the Lord’s discipline, 

<p class="indent-2"> Do not despond when he rebukes you; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines, 

<p class="indent-2"> And he chastises every child whom he acknowledges.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  for they could not bear to think of the command – ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – ‘I tremble with fear.’  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Hebrews 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Therefore we may say with confidence – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. 

<p class="indent-2"> What can mere people do to me?’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord –  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  May God bless you all.

<p class="c-num">[James 1]</p>

<h5>Greeting</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad. 

<h5>Advice on Various Subjects</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Do not be deceived, my dear friends.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  They look at themselves, then go on their way,  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world. 

<p class="c-num">[James 2]</p>

<h5>Warning on Various Subjects</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.” 

<p> “Then show me your faith,” I reply, “apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions. 

<p class="c-num">[James 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace. 

<p class="c-num">[James 4]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘God opposes the haughty, 

<p class="indent-2"> but gives grace to the humble.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor? 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them. 

<p class="c-num">[James 5]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you? 

<h5>Concluding Appeal</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

<h1>Peter’s First Letter</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 Peter 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure. 

<h5>The Christian’s Hope of Salvation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look. 

<h5>The Christian’s Character</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For scripture says – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You will be holy, because I am holy.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  For – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘All earthly life is but as grass, 

<p class="indent-2"> and all its splendor as the flower of grass. 

<p class="indent-1"> The grass fades, 

<p class="indent-2"> its flower falls, 

<p class="indent-3"> <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’ 

<p> And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Peter 2]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For there is a passage of scripture that runs – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious corner-stone; 

<p class="indent-2"> And those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’ 

<h5>Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times.</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and to governors as sent by him to punish evil-doers and to commend those who do right.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Peter 3]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  as they see your pure, reverent conduct.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing! 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  ‘The person who wants to enjoy life 

<p class="indent-2"> And see happy days – 

<p class="indent-1"> They should keep their tongue from evil 

<p class="indent-2"> And their lips from deceitful words, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  they should turn from evil and do good, 

<p class="indent-2"> They should seek for peace and follow after it; 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, 

<p class="indent-2"> And his ears are attentive to their prayers, 

<p class="indent-3"> But the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Peter 4]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Never grudge hospitality to one another.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right. 

<p class="c-num">[1 Peter 5]</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Greet one another with the kiss of love. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.

<h1>Peter’s Second Letter</h1>

<p class="c-num">[2 Peter 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 

<h5>The Transfiguration and the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this ‘tent,’ to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  for I know that the time for this ‘tent’ of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

<h5>Warning against separating Christianity from a Holy Life</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbors;  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for ‘the day of judgment’ –  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  but was rebuked for his offense. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – ‘A dog returns to what it has vomited’ and ‘A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.’ 

<p class="c-num">[2 Peter 3]</p>

<h5>A Reassertion of the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Savior given to you through your apostles.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  will come and ask scoffingly – ‘Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon [Note:        Or: and desire its coming.  ] . At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.

<h1>John’s First Letter</h1>

<p class="c-num">[1 John 1]</p>

<h5>Preface</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete. 

<h5>Fellowship with God</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us. 

<p class="c-num">[1 John 2]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did. 

<h5>A new commandment</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them. 

<h5>Those who know God should not love the world</h5>

<p>

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Little children, I am writing to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because your sins have been forgiven for Christ’s sake. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Parents, I am writing to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. 

<p class="indent-1"> Young people, I am writing to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because you have conquered the evil one. 

<p class="indent-1"> Children, I write to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because you have come to know the Father. 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Parents, I write to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because you have learned to know him who has been from the beginning. 

<p class="indent-1"> Young people, I write to you 

<p class="indent-2"> because you are strong, 

<p class="indent-2"> and God’s message is always in your hearts, 

<p class="indent-2"> and you have conquered the evil one. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever. 

<h5>Warnings against an antichrist</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him.  <span class="v-num">[28]</span>  Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming.  <span class="v-num">[29]</span>  Since you know he is righteous, you realize that everyone who does what is right is his child. 

<p class="c-num">[1 John 3]</p>

<h5>God’s Children</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous. 

<h5>Love each other</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  This is how we know that love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence:  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us. 

<p class="c-num">[1 John 4]</p>

<h5>True and False Inspiration</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world! 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception. 

<h5>God is love</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us. 

<p> God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  We love, because God first loved us.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other. 

<p class="c-num">[1 John 5]</p>

<h5>Faith and Confidence</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith!  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Indeed three testify:  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life. 

<h5>Final words</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.

<h1>John’s Second Letter</h1>

<p class="c-num">[2 John 1]</p>

<h5>Greetings</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours – the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son – in truth and love. 

<h5>Live in truth and love</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. – Let us love one another.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And this is love – to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world – men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching – they have both the Father and the Son.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them;  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work. 

<h5>Final words</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.

<h1>John’s Third Letter</h1>

<p class="c-num">[3 John 1]</p>

<h5>Greetings</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  From the elder to his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health – I know that all is well with your soul.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth. 

<h5>Gaius</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other followers – even when they are strangers to you.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Therefore, we should support people like them, and so take our share in their work for the truth. 

<h5>Diotrephes and Demetrius</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be the leader among them) doesn’t welcome us.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  So if I come, I will bring up his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that, he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers, but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say is true. 

<h5>Final words</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and ink.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Peace be with you. The friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one of our friends.

<h2>The Letter from</h2>

<h1>Jude</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Jude 1]</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  To those who, having received the call, have been loved by God the Father and protected by Jesus Christ, From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  May mercy, peace, and love be yours in ever increasing measure. 

<h5>Warnings against moral corruption</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to encourage you to fight in defense of the faith that has once for all been entrusted to the keeping of Christ’s people.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  For there have crept in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Now I want to remind you – but you already know it all – that, though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterward destroyed those who refused to believe in him;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains and black darkness.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, punishment in eternal fire. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial beings.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Yet even Michael, the archangel, when, in his dispute with the devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge him with maligning, but said merely ‘The Lord rebuke you!’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  But these people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam’s love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like Korah.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  These are the people who are blots on your ‘love-feasts,’ when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  they are wild sea waves, foaming with their own shame; they are ‘wandering stars,’ for which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  To these people, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, declared – ‘See! The Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones around him,  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  to execute judgment on all people, and to convict all godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken against him, godless sinners that they are!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  These people are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot; they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words on their lips; and they flatter others for the sake of what they can get from them. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  how they used to say to you – ‘As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  These are the people – animal and unspiritual – who cause divisions.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  To some show pity, because they are in doubt. ‘Drag them out of the fire,’ and save them.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  To others show pity, but with caution, hating the clothing polluted by their touch. 

<h5>Ascription</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  To him who is able to guard you from falling, and to bring you into his glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing –  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  to the one God, our Savior, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, glory, majesty, power, and dominion, as it was before time began, is now, and will be for all time to come. Amen.

<h1>The Revelation to John</h1>

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 1]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  who testified to the message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for the time is near. 

<h5>Messages to the Seven Churches</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood –  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and he made us a kingdom of priests in the service of God, his Father! – to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  He is coming among the clouds! Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. So will it be. Amen.

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  It said –  <span class="woc"> ‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicaea.’ </span> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said –  <span class="woc"> ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, </span> <span class="v-num">[18]</span> <span class="woc"> the Everliving.

<h5>The Vision of the Seven Seals</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and around the throne there was a rainbow of the color of an emerald.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And, whenever these creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  ‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’ 

<p>

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 5]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  But one of the elders said to me – ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  And they are singing a new song – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  and they cried in a loud voice – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and praise, and blessing.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  And the four creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 6]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – ‘Come.’  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – ‘Come.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – ‘Come.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They cried in a loud voice – ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’ 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 7]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  ‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites. 

<p><p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Napthali twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, 

<p class="indent-1"> from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And they are crying in a loud voice – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Salvation be ascribed to our God who is seated on his throne and to the Lamb.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  saying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Amen. Blessing and praise, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.’ 

<p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then one of the elders turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  ‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’ 

<p> ‘These,’ he said, ‘are they who come through the Great Persecution; they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 8]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour. 

<h5>Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  (The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 9]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer). 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow! 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulfur.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur that issued from their mouths;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 10]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – ‘Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said ‘Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And I was told – ‘You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 11]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow! 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped Him,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  saying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 12]</p>

<h5>Vision of Seven Figures</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and night.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and he took his stand on the sea-shore. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 13]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – ‘Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Let those who have ears hear.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.) 

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honor of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  (Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 14]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and he cried in a loud voice – ‘Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then a second angel followed, crying – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – ‘Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulfur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  (Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.”’ 

<p> “Yes,” answers the Spirit, “that they may rest from their toil. Their good deeds go with them.” 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – ‘Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.’  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – ‘Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.

<h5>Vision of Seven Curses</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvelous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Who will not honor and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 16]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  And I heard the response from the altar – ‘Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span> <span class="woc"> (‘I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.’) </span> <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew ‘Har-Magedon.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said ‘All is over.’)  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  There followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth – none so great;  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 17]</p>

<h5>Doom of the Enemies of Christ</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the sentence passed on that Great Harlot who is seated at the meeting of many waters,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.’  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  while on her forehead there was written this mystic name – ‘BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ALL IDOLATROUS ABOMINATIONS ON EARTH.’  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  but the angel said to me – ‘Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.’  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  (Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And the angel said to me – ‘The waters that you saw, where the Harlot is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast – they will hate the Harlot, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their kingdoms to the Beast, until God’s decrees will be executed.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  As for the woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the kings of the earth.’ 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 18]</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  With a mighty voice he cried – “She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.”  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then I heard another voice from heaven saying – “Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  Therefore in one day will these curses strike her – death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.”  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry – “Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour your judgment fell.”  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes –  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying –  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  “Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments, and precious stones, and pearls!  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.” Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried – “What city can compare with the Great city?”  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – “Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.”  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying – “So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.”  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 19]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Hallelujah! To our God belong salvation, and glory, and Power,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Again they cried – ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  and from the throne there came a voice which said – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Praise our God all you who serve him, You who worship him, both high and low.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying – 

<p><p class="indent-1"> ‘Hallelujah! For the Lord is king, our God, the Almighty.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honor, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.’ 

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then a voice said to me ‘Write – “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said – ‘These words of God are true.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulfur.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 20]</p>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  (The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years. 

<p> <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his prison,  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 21]</p>

<h5>The New Creation</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  And he who was seated on the throne said – ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said – ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’  <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  And he said to me – ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.  <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars – their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulfur. That is the Second Death.’ 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’  <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.  <span class="v-num">[12]</span>  It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.  <span class="v-num">[13]</span>  There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.  <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.  <span class="v-num">[16]</span>  The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.  <span class="v-num">[17]</span>  Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.  <span class="v-num">[18]</span>  The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.  <span class="v-num">[19]</span>  The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;  <span class="v-num">[20]</span>  the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.  <span class="v-num">[21]</span>  The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.  <span class="v-num">[22]</span>  And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.  <span class="v-num">[23]</span>  The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb.  <span class="v-num">[24]</span>  The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.  <span class="v-num">[25]</span>  Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there.  <span class="v-num">[26]</span>  And people will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.  <span class="v-num">[27]</span>  Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life. 

<p class="c-num">[Revelation 22]</p> <span class="v-num">[1]</span>  And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,  <span class="v-num">[2]</span>  in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  <span class="v-num">[3]</span>  Every thing that is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;  <span class="v-num">[4]</span>  they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.  <span class="v-num">[5]</span>  Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever. 

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p> <span class="v-num">[6]</span>  Then the angel said to me – “These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;  <span class="v-num">[7]</span>  and they said  <span class="woc"> ‘I will come quickly.’ </span>  Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[8]</span>  It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.  <span class="v-num">[9]</span>  But he said to me – “Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.” 

<p> <span class="v-num">[10]</span>  Then the angel said to me – “Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near.  <span class="v-num">[11]</span>  Let the wrong-doer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to be holy.”  <span class="v-num">[12]</span> <span class="woc"> (‘I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to each what their actions deserve. </span> <span class="v-num">[13]</span> <span class="woc"> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the End.’) </span> <span class="v-num">[14]</span>  Blessed will they be who wash their robes! They will have the right to approach the Tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.  <span class="v-num">[15]</span>  Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it. 

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>

<p> <span class="v-num">[16]</span> <span class="woc"> ‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these things before the churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David, the bright star of the Morning.’ </span>

<p class="indent-0">&nbsp;</p>
