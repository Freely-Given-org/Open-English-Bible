<span class="verse" rel="v018001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 shunned evil. He had a family of seven sons and 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 three daughters: and he owned seven thousand  sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke  of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a vast train of  servants, so that he was the richest man in all the 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 East. Now his sons used to hold feast day about,  and they would send and invite their three sisters 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 to eat and drink with them; and when the cycle  of feasts was over, Job used to send for them and  prepare them for worship, rising early and offering  burnt offerings for them all: for – said Job– <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance my children have sinned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cursed God in their heart.  And this Job never failed to do. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings  came to present themselves before Jehovah, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 among them came Satan. Then Jehovah asked  Satan where he had come from, and Satan answered  Jehovah thus, "From ranging the earth and from 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 walking up and down it." Then Jehovah said to  Satan: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hast thou noted my servant Job, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on earth there is none like him– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A man blameless and upright, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who fears God and shuns evil?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 To this Satan made answer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But is it for nothing that Job fears God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Hast Thou not Thyself fenced him and his house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all he possesses on every side? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his substance abounds in the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 But put forth Thy hand and touch all he possesses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "See! all he possesses is in thy power, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But lay not thy hand on the man himself." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Now on a certain day, as his sons and daughters  Were eating and drinking wine in the house of their 
<span class="verse" rel="v018001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 eldest brother, suddenly a messenger appeared  before Job with the tidings: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "The oxen were hard at the plough; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the asses were feeding beside them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 When sabeans fell upon them and seized them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The servants they slew with the sword– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fire of God has fallen from heaven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And burnt to a cinder the sheep and the servants– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Chaldeans, formed into three bands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made a raid on the camels and seized them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The servants they slew with the sword– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 While he was still speaking, another came and said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the house of their eldest brother: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 On a sudden a mighty wind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the other side of the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; came and smote and four sides of the house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it fell on the young folk and killed them– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only I alone am escaped to tell thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Then Job rose and rent his robe; and, after shaving <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; his head, he threw himself with these words pros- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; trate upon the ground: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 "Naked came I from my mother’s womb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And naked thither must I return. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah hath given, Jehovah hath taken: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of Jehovah be blessed." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 In all this Job committed no sin, nor did he charge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; God with unseemly dealing. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Now on a certain day the heavenly Beings came  to present themselves before Jehovah, and among  them came Satan to present himself before Jehovah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Then Jehovah asked Satan where he had come from,  and satan answered Jehovah thus, "From ranging  the earth and from walking up and down it." 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Then Jehovah said to Satan: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hast thou noted my servant Job, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on earth there is none like him– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A man blameless and upright, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who fears God and shuns evil? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And still he clings to his honour– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain hast thou set me on to destroy him." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 To this Satan made answer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Skin for skin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All a man’s goods will he give for his life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 But put forth Thy hand, touch his bone and his flesh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And assuredly then to Thy face he will curse Thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Whereat Jehovah said to Satan: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See! he is on thy power, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But take heed that thou spare his life." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Then forth Satan went from the presence of Jehovah. <br /><br /> And he smote Job from the sole of his foot to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 crown of his head with boils so grievous that he  took a potsherd to scratch with; and, as he was 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 sitting among the ashes, his wife said to him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Art thou clinging still to thine honour? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curse God and die." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 But Job said to her: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must thou too speak <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a foolish women speak? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We accept from God what is good: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we not accept what is evil?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In all this Job was guilty of no sin of speech. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 When Job’s three friends heard of all the misery  that had come upon him, they travelled each man  from his own place – Eliphaz the Temabite, Bildad  the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they  had made a tyrst together to come to condole with 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 him and comfort him. But when they caught a  glimpse of him at a distance they did not recognize  him. Then every man of them wept aloud and  tore his robe and scattered dust heavenwards upon 
<span class="verse" rel="v018002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 his head. Then they sat down beside him upon the  ground seven days and nights, and no one said a word  to him; for they saw that his pain was very great. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Thereafter Job opened his mouth to curse his 
<span class="verse" rel="v018003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 day, and thus he began: </p><h6>ACT 1</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Perished the day wherein I was born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the night which announced that a man-child had come. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800304a" id="00304a" >4a</span>
 Utter darkness let that night be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800309b" id="00309b" >9b</span>
 Looking for light, but finding none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800304b" id="00304b" >4b</span>
 May God in the heights above ask not after it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800304c" id="00304c" >4c</span>
 And may no beam shine forth upon it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 May darkness and gloom claim it for their own, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And may the thick cloud rest upon it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Black vapours of the day affright it! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 And let the thick darkness snatch it away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; May it not be joined to the days of the year, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or enter into the tale of the months. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 As for that night, let it be barren: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May there never ring through it a cry of joy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Accursed of sorcerers be that day– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those that are skilful to stir up Leviathan. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800309a" id="00309a" >9a</span>
 Dark be the stars of its morning twilight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01800309c" id="00309c" >9c</span>
 And never the eyelids of Dawn may it see; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Since it shut not the doors of my mother’s womb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hid not trouble from mine eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Why died I not at my birth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe my last as I came from the womb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Like a hidden untimely birth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like infants that never see light? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Why on the knees was I welcomed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why were there breasts to suck? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 For then had I lain down in quiet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then had I slept and had rest– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 With kings of the earth and with cousellors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who built stately tombs for themselves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Or with princes rich in gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had filled their houses with silver. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 There the wicked cease their tumult, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There the weary are at rest– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 Prisoners at ease together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deaf to the taskmaster’s voice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 There the small and the great are alike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the servants is free from his master. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 Why is light given to the wretched, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And life to the bitter in soul, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 To the man whose path is obscured, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is hedged round about by God– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Such as long for death, but it comes not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dig for it more than for treasure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 Who would joy o’er a mound of stones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rejoice, could they find a grave? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 For my bread there comes to me sighing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My groans are poured out like water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 For the evil I fear overtakes me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The things that I dread comes upon me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 Scarce have I ease or quiet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rest, when tumult cometh. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 
<span class="verse" rel="v018004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 May we lift up a word unto thee who art fainting, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For who has the heart to restrain his speech? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 see! thou hast instructed many, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strengthened the drooping hands. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Thy words used to set up the stumbling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strengthen the tottering knees. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 But now that it comes upon thee, thou art faint; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that it reaches thyself, thou art terrified. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Is not thy religion thy confidence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy blameless life thy hope? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Bethink thee: has an innocent man ever perished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or when have the just been cut off? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 It is those who plough wrong and sow trouble <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That reap it: – for this have I seen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 By the breath of God they perish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the blast of HIs anger they vanish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 The Lion roared, the hoarse lion thundered: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his young lion’s teeth were broken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 So for lack of prey he perished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Now to me a word came stealing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mine ear caught a whisper thereof, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 In thoughts from the visions of night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When deep sleep falleth on men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Fear came upon me and trembling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That made my bones all quake. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Then a breath passed over my face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hair of my flesh bristled up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 There – it – stood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not tell what it looked like– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This form before mine eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the silence I heard a voice say: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 Wise-hearted and strong as He is, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who hath ever successfully braved Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 Mountains He moves without effort, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns them about in His anger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 He shaketh the earth from her place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And maketh her pillars shudder. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 He speaks to the sun, and it shines not; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He setteth a seal on the stars. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 He strecheth the heavens all alone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He treadeth the heights of the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 He maketh the Bear and Orion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pleiades and the southern chambers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 He doeth great things and unsearchable, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marvellous things without number. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 Lo! He passes me by all unseen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeps past – but I cannot perceive Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 He seizeth, and who can prevent Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who dare ask Him, "What doest Thou?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 God will not withdraw His anger; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The helpers of Rahab stooped under Him: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 How much less can I give Him answer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And choose out my words against Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 Were I right, I could give Him no answer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But needs must entreat my Judge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 If I called, He would give me no answer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot believe He would listen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 For He Crushes me in a temptest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a wanton wound. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 He suffers me not to take breath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with bitterness He fills me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 Is it question of strength? There He is. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or of justice? Then who will implead Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 Am I right? Still mine own mouth condemns me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Innocent? He proveth me perverse. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 Innocent I am – but I reck not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spurn my life; ’tis all one. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 And therefore it is that I say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He destroyeth both guiltless and guilty." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 When the scourge bringeth sudden death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The despair of the blameless He mocketh. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 He hath given up the earth to the wicked; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He veileth the face of its judges. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be not He, who then? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 My days are more swift than a runner, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They flee unillumined by joy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 They glide like the ships of reed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an eagle that darts on its prey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 If I vow to forget my plaint <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to wear a bright face for a joyless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009028" id="009028" >28</span>
 I shudder at all my pains; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Thou wilt not hold me guiltless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009029" id="009029" >29</span>
 I then am I infallibly guilty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why should I labour in vain? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009030" id="009030" >30</span>
 For though I wash me with snow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleanse my hands with lye, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009031" id="009031" >31</span>
 Thou wouldst plunge me then in the mire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that even my friends would abhor me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009032" id="009032" >32</span>
 Thou art not a man like myself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we come into judgment together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009033" id="009033" >33</span>
 O for an umpire between us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lay his hand on us both! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009034" id="009034" >34</span>
 Let Him take but His rod from off me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And affright me no more with His terrors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018009035" id="009035" >35</span>
 And then I would speak unafraid– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For not such at heart am I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> In my soul is a loathing of life, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will let my complaint loose against Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 I will say to God, "Do not condemn me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But show me the ground of Thy quarrel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 What dost Thou gain from oppressing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spurning the work of Thy hands? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 Hast Thou then eyes of flesh? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or seest Thou as man seeth? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 Are Thy days like the days of mortals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Thy years like the days of man, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 That Thou shouldest seek out my guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make this search for my sin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 Though Thou knowest I am not guilty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no treachery cleaves to my hand? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 Thy hands did fashion and mould me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now wilt Thou turn and destroy me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 Remember Thou madest me like clay, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And back to the dust wilt Thou bring me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 Didst Thou not pour me out like milk, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And curdle me after like cheese, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 Clothe me with skin and with flesh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And knit me with bones and with sinews? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 Life Thou didst grant me and favour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Providence guarded my spirit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 While this was Thy secret heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this was Thy purpose, I know. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 Do I sin? Then Thou dost observe me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And refuse to acquit me of guilt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010015" id="010015" >15</span>
 Am I wicked? Then woe us me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just? I dare not lift up my head– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of shame and drunken with sorrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 If I rise, like a lion Thou huntest me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working fresh marvels upon me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 And bringing new witness against me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine anger with me Thou increasest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou musterest fresh hosts against me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 O why from the womb didst Thou bring me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O why died I not all unseen? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 O to be as though I had not been, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borne from the womb to the grave! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 Are the days of my life not few? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O leave me to smile a little, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 Ere I go to return no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the land of darkness and gloom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 To the land of murky darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of gloom and utter confusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the very light is as darkness." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> Then Zophar of Naamah answered and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Should a voluble man go unanswered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man who but babbles be justified? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 Must men hold their peace at thy bragging? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mocking is no one to curb? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 Thou maintainest thy way to be pure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thyself to be clean in His sight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 But oh that God would speak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And open His lips against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 And show thee the secrets of wisdom– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How marvellous are her achievements! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For then thou shouldst know that thy guilt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God remembers not wholly against thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 Canst thou find out the deep things of God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or come nigh the Almighty’s perfection? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 It is higher than heaven – what canst thou? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeper than Sheol – what knowest thou? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 Longer than earth is its measure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And broader it is than the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 When He sweeps past and puts men in durance <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And calls them to trial, who can turn Him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 For well He knoweth vain men: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks upon sin and He marks it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 Even a senseless man may be taught, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a wild ass’s colt may be caught. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 Now, if thou wouldst prepare thy heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretch out thy hands unto Him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 And put away sin from thy hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let wrong dwell no more in thy tent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 Then thy face thou wouldst lift without blemish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou wouldst be steadfast and fearless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 Yea, thou wouldst forget thy sorrow– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As floods that are passed wouldst thou think of it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 Brighter than noon would thy life rise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy darkness would be as the morning. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011018" id="011018" >18</span>
 Secure wouldst thou be in thy hope: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou couldst lie without trembling or care– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011019" id="011019" >19</span>
 Lay thee down without one to affright thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And many would sue for thy favour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place of their refuge is perished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their hope is – to breathe their last. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> Then Job answered and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 Verily ye are the people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wisdom shall die with you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 But, like you, I have understanding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knoweth not things like these? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 A laughing-stock to his friend <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is become one whose cry God had answered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A laughing-stock is the righteous; <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018012The" id="012The" >The</span>
 blameless is doomed to disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The man of ease mocks at his fate: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are thrusts for the feet that are slipping. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 It is tents of robbers that prosper, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And those who vex God that are safe– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who say, "Is not God in my hand?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012007" id="012007" >7</span>
 But inquire of the beasts – they will teach thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds of the air – they will show thee: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012008" id="012008" >8</span>
 The creatures that crawl – they will teach thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fish of the sea – they will tell thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 For which of them all doth not know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 In whose hand are all living souls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the breath of all humankind? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 Doth not the ear test words <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the palate tastes food for itself? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 Doth wisdom depend upon years, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding on length of days? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 With Him is wisdom and might, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding and counsel are His. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 See! He breaketh down, and who buildeth? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imprisons, and none can set free. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 See! He holds back the floods and they dry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then He hurls them on earth and confounds it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 With Him is strength and achievement; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deceived and deceiver are His. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 The wise men of earth He makes foolish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judges He turns into madmen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012018" id="012018" >18</span>
 The fetters kings rivet He loosens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And binds their own loins with a chain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012019" id="012019" >19</span>
 He leadeth priests barefoot away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient families He overturneth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012020" id="012020" >20</span>
 He removeth the speech of the trusty; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elders He robs of discretion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012021" id="012021" >21</span>
 He poureth contempt upon princes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looseth the belt of the strong. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012022" id="012022" >22</span>
 He revealeth the deep things of darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gloom-wrapped He bringeth to light. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012023" id="012023" >23</span>
 He makes nations great and destroys them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expands them, then hurls them to ruin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012024" id="012024" >24</span>
 Earth’s chiefs He bereaves of their judgment; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They wander in trackles wastes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018012025" id="012025" >25</span>
 Where they grope in the unit darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stagger like drunken men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> Lo! all this mine eye hath seen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine ear hath heard it and marked it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 One inviteth his friends to a feast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the eyes of his children are failing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 Thou has made me the by-word of nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They look upon me as a monster. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017007" id="017007" >7</span>
 Mine eye is grown dim for vexation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My members are all as a shadow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017011" id="017011" >11</span>
 My days pass away without hope; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The desires of my heart are extinguished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017012" id="017012" >12</span>
 The night I turn into day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the light is before me as darkness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017013" id="017013" >13</span>
 If I hope, then the grave is my home, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my couch I have spread in the darkness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017014" id="017014" >14</span>
 I call to the pit, "My mother"; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And unto the worm, "My sister." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017015" id="017015" >15</span>
 Where then were that "hope" of mine? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my happiness who can espy? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018018003" id="018003" >3</span>

 Honest men thrill with horror at this: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pure man is roused by such godlessness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018017009" id="017009" >9</span>

 His great swinging strides become shortened; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His own counsel maketh him stumble. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018018008" id="018008" >8</span>
 His foot is thrust into a net, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that over the net-work ge sprawleth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 A snare shall take hold of his heel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a trap shall close tightly upon him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 A noose lies concealed on the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a trap on his path doth await him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The pestilence gnaws at his skin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the first-born of death at his members. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 Then, dragged from his tent in despair, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is marched to the King of Terrors. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018018015" id="018015" >15</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 These ten times ye have put me to shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And set upon me unabashedly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Behold! I cry "Wrong" – but no answer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I call – but justice is none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019008" id="019008" >8</span>
 My way He hath fenced round impassably, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darkness He sets on my path. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019009" id="019009" >9</span>
 He hath stripped my glory from off me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And taken the crown from my head. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 He hath torn me clean down – I am gone: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath plucked up my hope like a tree. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019011" id="019011" >11</span>

 Yea, even young boys despise me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mock me when I try to rise. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019019" id="019019" >19</span>
 All mine intimate friends abhor me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man whom I love turns against me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018019020" id="019020" >20</span>
 My skin clings to my bones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I escape with my flesh in my teeth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Knowest thou not this from of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time there were men on the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 That the song of the wicked is short, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hypocrite’s joy but a moment? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 His sons shall be crushed by privation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wealth shall his children restore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020011" id="020011" >11</span>
 The vigour of youth filled his bones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But within him it shall lie in the dust. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020012" id="020012" >12</span>
 Though evil be sweet in his mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he keeps it hid under his tongue; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020013" id="020013" >13</span>
 Though he spare it and let it not go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But still holdeth it back in his mouth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Yet his food in his stomach is turned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is poison of asps within him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020015" id="020015" >15</span>
 The wealth that he swallowed he vomits; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God easteth it forth from his belly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020016" id="020016" >16</span>

 His increasing gain brings him no gladness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His traffickling yields him no joy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018020019" id="020019" >19</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018020020" id="020020" >20</span>
 His treasures have brought him no peace. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his precious things cannot deliver. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Such the wicked man’s portion from God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God’s heritage unto the rebel. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> Then Job answered and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018021003" id="021003" >3</span>
 Suffer me, for I would speak also: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when I have spoken, mock on. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 Is it man that I would complain of? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why should I not be impatient? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021005" id="021005" >5</span>
 Now listen to me; and, in horror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay ye your hand on your mouth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Their seed is established before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their offspring in sight of their eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 Their homes are strangers to terror; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No rod of God is on them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021010" id="021010" >10</span>
 Their bull doth unfailingly gender, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their cow never loses her calf. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 Like a flock they send their young children; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their boys and their girls dance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018021012" id="021012" >12</span>
 They sing to the timbrel and lyre; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sound of the pipe they make merry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Ah, how small am I! What can I answer? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay my hand on my mouth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018040005" id="040005" >5</span>
 Once indeed have I spoken; – enough: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea twice – but not ever again. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="042001">42</span>
<span class="verse" rel="v018042002" id="042002" >2</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v01804203b" id="04203b" >3b</span>
 Therefore spake I without understanding, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01804203c" id="04203c" >3c</span>
 Of wonders beyond my knowledge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018042005" id="042005" >5</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018042006" id="042006" >6</span>
 And therefore I spurn (my words) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And repent in dust and in ashes. </p><h6>The Epilogue</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="043001">43</span>
<span class="verse" rel="v018043007" id="043007" >7</span>
 So after Jehovah has spoken these words to Job,  He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My anger is  hot against thee and thy two friends; because,  unlike my servant Job, ye have not spoken the 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043008" id="043008" >8</span>
 truth about me. But now, go to my servant Job  with seven bullocks and seven rams, and offer them  as a burnt-offering for yourselves, and my servant  Job shall pray for you; for, our of regard for him,  I will not put you to confusion for your failure to  speak the truth about me, as my servant Job has 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043009" id="043009" >9</span>
 done." So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the  Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did  as Jehovah told them, and Jehovah had regard unto  Job. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018043010" id="043010" >10</span>
 So when Job prayed for his friends, Jehovah  changed his fortunes, giving him double of all he 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043011" id="043011" >11</span>
 had before. Then his brothers and sister and old  friends came – every one of them – and dined  with him at his home; and they condoled with  him, and comforted him for all the misery that  Jehovah had brought upon him. Besides, each of  them made him a present of a piece of money and a  gold ring. 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043012" id="043012" >12</span>
 Thus in the end Jehovah made Job more blessed  than he was at the first – with his fourteen thousand  sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043013" id="043013" >13</span>
 oxen, and one thousand she-asses. Besides, he had  seven sons, and three daughters whom he named 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043014" id="043014" >14</span>
 in the order of their birth Jemimah, Keziah, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v018043015" id="043015" >15</span>
 Keren-happuch. In all the world were no women  found so fair as the daughters of Job, and their  father made them sharers in his inheritance with  their brothers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018043016" id="043016" >16</span>
 After this Job lived a hundred and forty years.  Thus he was spared to see not only his children, but  his grandchildren – four generations. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018043017" id="043017" >17</span>
 Then Job died – old and full of days. </p><h6>Elihu’s Interpretation of Suffering</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="032001">32</span> Now these three men ceased answering Job,  because he was righteous in his own eyes. Then 
<span class="verse" rel="v018032002" id="032002" >2</span>
 the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite,  of the family of Ram, was kindled; against Job  was his anger kindled, because he had made himself 
<span class="verse" rel="v018032003" id="032003" >3</span>
 out to be more righteous than God. But his anger  was kindled against his three friends as well,  because they had condemned Job without finding 
<span class="verse" rel="v018032004" id="032004" >4</span>
 any answer. Now, as they were older, Elihu had 
<span class="verse" rel="v018032005" id="032005" >5</span>
 waited while they were speaking with Job; but,  on seeing that the three men had no answer to offer,  Elihu’s anger was kindled. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018032006" id="032006" >6</span>
 Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite  answered and said:  I am but young in years, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While ye are aged men: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was timid, and feared <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To set my opinion before you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032007" id="032007" >7</span>
 I felt that days ought to speak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that years gave the right to teach wisdom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032008" id="032008" >8</span>
 But the spririt enlighteneth men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Almighty inspires then with insight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032009" id="032009" >9</span>
 It is not the old men that are wise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the aged that understand truth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032010" id="032010" >10</span>
 And so, pray, listen to me– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, too, would set forth my opinion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01803211a" id="03211a" >11a</span>
 I waited what you had to say, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v01803211b" id="03211b" >11b</span>
 I lent mine ear to your reasons; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01803212a" id="03212a" >12a</span>
 Yea, I gave heed unto you, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v01803211c" id="03211c" >11c</span>
 While ye searched out what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v01803212b" id="03212b" >12b</span>
 But see! none brought conviction to Job, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v01803212c" id="03212c" >12c</span>
 Not a man of you answered his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032013" id="032013" >13</span>
 Say not "Here wer have come upon wisdom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis God must confound him, not man." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032014" id="032014" >14</span>
 He hath not yet debated with me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will I give him answers like yours. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032015" id="032015" >15</span>
 Panic-stricken they answer no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words have floated away from them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032016" id="032016" >16</span>
 Must I wait because they are silent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand still, and answer no more? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032017" id="032017" >17</span>
 Nay, but I, too, will answer my share; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, too, will set forth my opinion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032018" id="032018" >18</span>
 For filled with words am I; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath in my body distress me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032019" id="032019" >19</span>
 Like wine without vent is my belly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like new wine-skins ready to burst. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032020" id="032020" >20</span>
 I must speak and so find me relief; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must open my lips and make answer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032021" id="032021" >21</span>
 I would show my favour to none, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And give flattering titles to no man. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018032022" id="032022" >22</span>
 Of flattery I know nothing– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else soon would my Maker remove me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="033001">33</span> But listen, Job, pray, to my words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And give ear unto all that I say. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033002" id="033002" >2</span>
 Behold! I have opened my mouth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tongue in my palate hath spoken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033003" id="033003" >3</span>
 MY heart poureth forth words of knowledge; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfeigned is the speech of my lips. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033005" id="033005" >5</span>

 See! I am in God’s sight as thou; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, too, was fashioned to clay. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033004" id="033004" >4</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018033008" id="033008" >8</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018033010" id="033010" >10</span>
 But He findeth pretexts against me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He counteth me as His foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033011" id="033011" >11</span>
 He setteth my feet in the stocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keepeth watch over all my ways. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033012" id="033012" >12</span>
 Behold! when I cry, comes no answer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God hideth Himself from men." </p><h6>God speaks to Men through Dreams and Visions</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033013" id="033013" >13</span>
 Now why dost thou plead against Him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That He giveth thy words no answer? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033014" id="033014" >14</span>
 For God hath one manner of speech, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea two – and He doth not revoke it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033015" id="033015" >15</span>
 In a dream, in a vision of night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When deep sleep falleth on men," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In slumbers upon the bed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033016" id="033016" >16</span>
 Then He opens the ears of men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sendeth them fearful warnings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033017" id="033017" >17</span>
 To turn men aside from wrong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to bring human pride to an end– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033018" id="033018" >18</span>
 To keep back man’s soul from the pit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his life from descending to Sheol. </p><h6>God speaks to Men through Pain and Sickness</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033019" id="033019" >19</span>
 Or on bed of pain he is chastened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all his bones are benumbed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033020" id="033020" >20</span>
 His soul has a loathing of bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the daintiest food he abhorreth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033021" id="033021" >21</span>
 His flesh is lean and wasted; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His bones are all but bare. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033022" id="033022" >22</span>
 His soul draweth nigh to the pit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his life to the angels of death. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033023" id="033023" >23</span>
 Then over him there is an angel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpreter, one of a thousand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who expounds unto man his chastisement, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018033024" id="033024" >24</span>
 Takes pity on him and says: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him not go down to the pit: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found (for his soul) a ransom." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033025" id="033025" >25</span>
 Then his flesh becomes fresher than child’s, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returns to the days of his youth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033026" id="033026" >26</span>
 He prays unto God with acceptance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks on His face with joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells the story of his salvation, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v018033027" id="033027" >27</span>
 And sings before men this song: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have sinned and perverted the right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet He hath not requited my sin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033028" id="033028" >28</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018033030" id="033030" >30</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v018033031" id="033031" >31</span>
 Be attentive, Job, listen to me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be thou silent, and I will speak. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018033032" id="033032" >32</span>
 If aught thou canst say, then answer me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, for my wish is to clear thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 But if not, listen thou unto me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be silent, while I teach thee wisdom. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="034001">34</span> Then Elihu went on: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018034003" id="034003" >3</span>
 For the ear is the tester of words <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the palate the taster of food. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018034004" id="034004" >4</span>

 For Job claimeth to be in the right: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God," he says, "hath deprived me of justice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018034006" id="034006" >6</span>

 So, ye men of intelligence, listen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Far be it from God to do evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the Almighty to err. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018034011" id="034011" >11</span>
 For the work of each man He requiteth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bringeth his way back upon him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018034012" id="034012" >12</span>
 God assuredly cannot do wrong. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Almighty would not pervert justice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 In a moment they die – at midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich are convulsed, they pass: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mysteriously removeth the mighty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v018034027" id="034027" >27</span>
 For they turned from following Him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they gave no heed to His ways. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018034028" id="034028" >28</span>

 Who can lay bare the face of his garment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or enter the folds of his breastplate? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037014" id="037014" >14</span>
 Who can open the doors of his face? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round about his teeth lieth terror. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037015" id="037015" >15</span>
 His back is a ripple of shields, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his breast is a seal of flint. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037016" id="037016" >16</span>
 One shield is so near to another <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That no air can come between them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037017" id="037017" >17</span>
 Each cleaveth so close to his fellow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So locked, that they cannot be served. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037018" id="037018" >18</span>
 Through the breath of his nostrils light flashes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes are the lids of the morning. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037019" id="037019" >19</span>
 Out of his mouth go torches <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sparks of fire leap forth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037020" id="037020" >20</span>
 Smoke issues out of his nostrils, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a seething and boiling pot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037021" id="037021" >21</span>
 His breath setteth coals ablaze, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a flame goeth forth from his mouth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037022" id="037022" >22</span>
 His neck is the home of strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And terror danceth before him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037023" id="037023" >23</span>
 The flakes of his flesh are welded <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So firm that they cannot be moved. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037024" id="037024" >24</span>
 His heart is as firm as a stone– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, firm as the nether mill-stone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037025" id="037025" >25</span>
 When he lifts himself, strong men are terrified; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his teeth are the mighty dismayed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037026" id="037026" >26</span>
 No sword availeth against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor spear nor dart nor arrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037027" id="037027" >27</span>
 He counteth iron as straw, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And brass as rotten wood; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037028" id="037028" >28</span>
 No arrow can put him to flight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On him sling-stones are turned to stubble. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037029" id="037029" >29</span>
 Clubs are counted as reed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he laughs at the whirr of a javelin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037030" id="037030" >30</span>
 Beneath him (his scales, like) sharp sherds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread marks, as of sledge, on the mire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037031" id="037031" >31</span>
 He makes the deep boil like a pot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stirreth the sea like ointment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037032" id="037032" >32</span>
 In his wake is a shinning path– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would think the deep to be hoary. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037033" id="037033" >33</span>
 There is not his like upon earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Created to know no fear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v018037034" id="037034" >34</span>
 Everything that is high is afraid of him: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is king o’er the sons of pride.
