How lonely the city <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once crowded with people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She that was great among nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is now as a widow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She that was queen of the provinces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is a vassal. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Sore, sore she weeps in the night; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are tears on her cheecks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is no one to comfort <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all those that loved her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All her friends have proved faithless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And turned to be foes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 From sorrow and toil into exile <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath Judah departed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And now is her home with the hearthen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no rest she findeth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of her straits her pursuers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have all overtaken her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 The highways to Zion lie mourning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For pilgrims are none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All desolate now are her gates, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her priest are in sorrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her virgins are dragged away far; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She herself is in bitterness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Supreme her foes are now, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her enemies triumph. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord hath afflicted her sore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her manifold sins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone are her little once captive <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 The glory is vanished clean <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the daughter of Zion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her princes are like unto harts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can nowhere find pasture; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All feeble they move on their way <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With pursuers behind them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Jerusalem calleth to mind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days of her travail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When into the hands of the foemen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her people fell helpless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The mocking foe feasted his eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her sore desolation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so she hath fallen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All they that honoured despise her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At sight of her nakedness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She meanwhile groaneth and moaneth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And turneth her backward. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Her filthiness clung to her skirts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She became all abhorrent. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To the future she gave not a thought, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So her fall was appalling. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, O Lord, what I suffer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the insolent foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 The foeman hath stretched out his hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To secure all her treasures. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearthen she saw enter in <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her temple profaneâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Even those Thou forbadest to mix <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Thine own congregation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Her people all groan and moan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their search after bread. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have given away their treasures <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For food to revive them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, O Jehovah, and see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How abject am I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 All ye that pass by, I appeal to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look ye and see; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Has there ever been sorrow like mine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like that dealt out to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Lord, in His fierce indignation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did put me to grief? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 He hurled down fire from on high; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It hath entered my bones. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A net He hath spread for my feet; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath turned me backward. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Faint He hath left me and desolate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the day long. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 A watch He hath kept on my sins; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And into a yoke <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For my neck with His hands He hath twined them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, crippling my strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath given me into the hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a foe irresistible. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 The Lord hath hurled to the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the strong men within me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath summoned a festal assembly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To crush my young (warriors). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord in His wine-press hath trodden <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter of Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 For these things I weep without creasing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes stream with tears; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For none have I now by my side <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To refresh me and comfort me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My children are clean distraught, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the foe hath prevailed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Zion hath stretched forth her hands; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no one to comfort her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On her neighbours the Lord laid a charge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be hostile to Jacob; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And now is Jerusalem vile <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And abhorrent among them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 As for the Lord, He is just; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the rebel was I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye peoples all, hear, I entreat you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And look on my sorrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Together my maidens and youths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are gone into captivity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 I called upon those that had loved me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they have deceived me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the city my priest and mine elders <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have perished of hunger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the bread they searched in their need, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But their search was in vain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Look, Lord, for distress is upon me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ferment within me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Within me my heart writhes with pain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, for playing the rebel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword dealeth death in the streets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the houses the pestilence. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 Listen to these my sighs; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no one to comfort me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My foes have all heard with delight <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the evil Thou wroughtest me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing the day Thou proclaimedst <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all of my sins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 Let their wickedness all come before Thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them fare like me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And do even so unto them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Thou didst unto me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For my sighs are many and many, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sore is my heart. </p><h6>The Divine Judgment and the Inconsolable Sorrow</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Alas! How the Lord is beclouding <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter of Zion! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the heaven down to earth He hath hurled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the day of His wrath He remembers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His foot-stool no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Without pity the Lord hath engulfed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the homesteads of Jacob. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In His wrath He hath torn clean down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the strongholds of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath hurled to the ground in dishonour <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her king and her princes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 He hath hewn in the glow of His anger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Israelâ€™s horn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath drawn His right hand back <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the face of the foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a fire He is blazing in Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devouring around. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 His bow He hath bent like a foeman; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stands as for siege. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All the lovely He slays in the tent <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the daughter of Zion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath poured forth His anger like fire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 The Lord hath become like a foe; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath swallowed up Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Swallowed her palaces allâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath ruined her strongholds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And heaped on the daughter of Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamenting and woe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 His booth like His vine He hath ravaged; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath ruined His trysting-place. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah hath blotted from Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feast and the sabbath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The king and the priest He hath spurned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heat of His anger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 The Lord hath rejected His altar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast off His holy place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Given to the hands of the foemen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walls of her palaces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the house of the Lord there were shouts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the shouts of a feast-day. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 For the walls of the daughter of Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord hath planned ruin. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He stretched out the line, and withdrew not <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ravaging hand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Wall and rampart He plunged into mourningâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together they languish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Sunk in the dust are her gates, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her bars He hath shivered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her king and her princes are exiles <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And guidance is none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, and no vision hath come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Lord to His prophets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Speechless they sit on the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the elders of Zionâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With dust cast up on their heads, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with girdles of sack-cloth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The maids of Jerusalem bow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their heads to the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Mine eyes are wasted with weeping, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My bowels are troubled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is poured out on the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wreck of my people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The babe and the suckling lie faint <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the streets of the city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 To their mothers they keep on saying, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O where is our bread?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the wounded they lie in a swoon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the streets of the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As they pour out their lives (to the death) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the breasts of their mothers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 With what shall I rank or compare thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O daughter of Jerusalem? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is thy like, that I comfort thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virgin of Zion? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For vast as the sea is thy ruin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Alas!) who can heal thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 The visions thy prophets have brought thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are false and dishonest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not uncover thy guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so save thee from exile. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The visions they uttered for thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were deceptive and false. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 They clapped their hand over theeâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All they that passed by. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They hissed and they wagged their heads <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Jerusalemâ€™s daughter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; " Is this the city men called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perfection of Beauty?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Against thee thine enemies all <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened wide their mouths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They hissed and they wagged their heads <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Jerusalemâ€™s daughter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the city men called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perfection of Beauty?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Against thee thine enemies all <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened wide their mouths. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They hissed and they gnashed their teeth: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have swallowed her up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this is the day that we looked for: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have it, we see it." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Jehovah hath done what He planned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath accomplished His word: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As in days long ago He enjoined, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath wrecked without pity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath made thee the sport of thy foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And exalted thine enemies. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Cry thou aloud to the Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O virgin of Zion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour down thy tears like a torrent <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By day and by night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Give thyself no respite, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No rest to thine eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Arise, pierce the night with thy cries, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each night-watch beginneth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour out like water thy heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the Lord. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift up thy hands unto Him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the life of thy littles ones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 Behold, O Lord, and consider <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom thus Thou maltreatest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall women devour their own offspring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The babes that they dandled? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the priest and the prophet be slain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Lordâ€™s holy place? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 In the streets on the ground they are lyingâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young and the old. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My maidens and young men together <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are fallen by the sword. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the day of Thy wrath Thou hast slaughtered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And slain without pity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Thou didst summon, as though â€™twere a feast-day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The villages round. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But not one in the day of Thine anger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Escaped or was left; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The children I brought up and fondled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were slain by the foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> I am the man who was humbled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the rod of His anger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 The way that He guided and led me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was dark and unlighted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Against me alone was His hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever turned all the day. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 He hath shrivelled my flesh and my skin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath broken my bones. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 He hath built round bout me a wall <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of exhaustion and bitterness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 He hath made me to dwell in the darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As those long dead. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 He hath shut me behind solid walls; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath loaded my chain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 When I cry and entreat Him for help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is deaf to my prayer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 He hath blocked up my path with hewn stone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my way He hath tangled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 He lurketh for me like a bear <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a lion in ambush. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 He chased me aside and He tore me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And left me forlorn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 His bow he bent, and He set me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mark for His arrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Into my reins He hath driven <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shafts of His quiver. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 A derision was I to all peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their song all the day. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 To the full did He fill me with bitterness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wormwood He sated me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 He hath broken my teeth with gravel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And heaped me with ashes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 He hath robbed me of peace; and of weal <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 So I said, "My glory is gone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my hope in Jehovah." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 The thought of my woe and my wandering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wormwood and gall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 My soul doth for ever recall them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is bowed down within me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Now this I will lay on my heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And will therefore take hopeâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 That the love of the Lord is unceasing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His pity unfailing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 Thy kindness is new every morning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And great is Thy faithfulness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 "The Lord is my portion," I said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will hope then in Him." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 Those that wait for the Lord find Him graciousâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The souls that do seek Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 It is good, then, in silence to wait <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the help of the Lord. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003027" id="003027" >27</span>
 It is good for a man that he carry <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A yoke in his youth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003028" id="003028" >28</span>
 Let him sit all alone and keep silence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When He hath imposed it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003029" id="003029" >29</span>
 Let him lay his lips low in the dust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For perchance there is hope. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003030" id="003030" >30</span>
 Let him offer his cheek to the smiter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bear all the taunt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003031" id="003031" >31</span>
 For Jehovah will not cast away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The afflicted for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003032" id="003032" >32</span>
 Though He wound, He will yet have compassionâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His love is so great. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003033" id="003033" >33</span>
 He is loth to give sorrow or pain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the children of men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003034" id="003034" >34</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v025003035" id="003035" >35</span>
 When a man is deprived of his right <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the Highest: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003036" id="003036" >36</span>
 When the cause of a man is subverted: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth not the Lord see? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003037" id="003037" >37</span>
 Where is he that can bring things to pass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Lord hath not ordered? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003038" id="003038" >38</span>
 Do not evil and good come alike <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mouth of the Highest? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003039" id="003039" >39</span>
 Why then should a mortal complain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When chastised for his sins? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003040" id="003040" >40</span>

 "We have transgressed and rebelled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thou hast not pardoned. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v025003049" id="003049" >49</span>
 Mine eye poureth down without rest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And without any respite, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003050" id="003050" >50</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v025003052" id="003052" >52</span>
 They have hunted me sore like a birdâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that groundlessly hate meâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003053" id="003053" >53</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v025003054" id="003054" >54</span>
 Waters flowed over my head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I said, "I am lost." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003055" id="003055" >55</span>
 From the depths of the dungeon, O Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I call on Thy name; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003056" id="003056" >56</span>
 And my voice Thou didst hear: "O hide not <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine ear from my cry." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003057" id="003057" >57</span>
 Thou camest the day that I called Thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And badest me fear not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003058" id="003058" >58</span>
 Thou pleddest my cause, O Lord, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And didst ransom my life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003059" id="003059" >59</span>
 Thou hast seen, Lord, how I am wronged; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O secure for me justice: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003060" id="003060" >60</span>
 For all the revenge Thou hast seen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they plotted against me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003061" id="003061" >61</span>
 O Lord, Thou has heard all the insults <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They plotted against me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003062" id="003062" >62</span>
 The threatenings and plots without ceasing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those that assail me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025003063" id="003063" >63</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v025003064" id="003064" >64</span>

 Pursue them in wrath and destroy them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From under Thy heavens. </p><h6>The Fate of the People and their Leaders</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Alas! How bedimmed is the gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most pure gold. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The jewels, so sacred, lie scattered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At every street corner. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 The children of Zion, the precious, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose worth is as gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Count, alas! but as earthenware pitchers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of the potter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 Even the monsters give breast <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they suckle their young; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But the daughters of my people are cruel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ostriches wild. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 The tongue of the sucking child cleaves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To his palate for thirst. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The children are craving for bread; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none to dispose it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Those that had feasted on dainties <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now waste on the streets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that were nurtured in scarlet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie huddled on ash-heaps. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 The guilt of my people surpassed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transgressions of Sodom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose overthrow came in a flash <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere a hand could be wrung. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 Her princes were purer than snow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were whiter than milk, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With a skin more ruddy than coral <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And veins like the sapphire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Now blacker than darkness their formâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the streets no one knows them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their skin is drawn tight on their bones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is dry as a stick. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Better they that are slain with the sword <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than that perish with hunger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pinning away for the lack <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the fruits of the field. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 The hands of compassionate women <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have sodden their children. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, these have served them for food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wreck of my people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 The Lord hath accomplised His wrath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath poured out His hot anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And kindled in Zion a fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which devoured her foundations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 No kings of the earth had believed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no folk in the world, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That assailant or foeman could enter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates of Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 It was all for the sins of her prophets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crimes of her priests, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have shed in the midst of the city <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood of the righteous. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 With the blood-stains upon them they reel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the blind through the streets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they touch with their robes those whom erstwhile <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could not endure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 "Away, ye unclean!" â€“ men adjure themâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Away, touch us not!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So they stagger and wander around <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no resting for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 Jehovah Himself hath dispersed themâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He careth no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the priest Ha hath shown no regard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the prophets no pity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 How long did our weary eyes watch <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the help that was vain! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, on our watch-tower we watched <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the nation that saved not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 They hunted our steps, that we dared not <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appear in out streets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Our days were cut short and completed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our end was now come. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 Swifter were they that pursued us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than eagles of heaven. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the mountains they chased us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They ambushed the desert. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 The breath of our life, Godâ€™s anointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was trapped in their toilsâ€“ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He of whom we had said, "â€™Neath his shade <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall live as a nation." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v025004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 Be glad and rejoice in thy home-land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O daughter of Edom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee, too, the cup shall come round; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thouâ€™lt be drunken and naked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 O Zion, thy guilt is now blotted: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of exile no more! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But thy guilt He shall visit, O Edom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sins are laid bare. </p><h6>Her Sorrows</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Bethink thee, O Lord, of our plight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look and see how Thy folk are insulted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v025005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 Princes were hanged by their hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the faces of elders dishonoured. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
