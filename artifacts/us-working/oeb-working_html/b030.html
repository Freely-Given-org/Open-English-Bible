<span class="verse" rel="v030001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Amos said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  roars from Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and utters his voice from Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the top of Carmel becomes arid. </p><h6>The Judgment About to Overtake Israel’s Guilty Neighbors</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Damascus’ three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Therefore I will send fire on Hazael’s house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 and I will break open the gate of Damascus, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sceptered ruler of Beth-Eden; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Gaza’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They carried away captive a whole nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sold them as slaves to Edom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and it shall devour her palaces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sceptered ruler of Askelon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will turn my hand against Ekron, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Tyre’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and did not remember the brotherly covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will devour her palaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Edom’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They pursued their relatives with the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; stilled their pity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; cherished their anger continually, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; retained their fury forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 So I will send a fire into Teman. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Ammonites’ three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in their lust for land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will destroy her palaces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with a war-cry in the day of battle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Their king will go into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he and his nobles together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Moab’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom,       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 to desecrate the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So I will send a fire into Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will devour the palaces of Kirioth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with a war-cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with the sound of trumpets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 I will kill the ruler, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all his nobles I will slay with him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Judah’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have rejected the law of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and have not kept his statutes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but their false gods their ancestors followed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; have led them astray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 So I will send a fire on Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem. </p><h6>The Judgment Awaiting Thrice Guilty Israel</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Israel’s three crimes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no, four! – I will not rescind my judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They sell the righteous for money, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the needy for a pair of shoes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 They trample on the head of the poor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; push the humble out of the way. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Father and son go to the same temple girl, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and so profane my holy name. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 They stretch themselves on garments taken in pledges beside every altar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they drink the wine of those who have been fined in the house of their God.       <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; whose height was like that of the cedars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as strong as oaks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I destroyed their fruit from above and their roots from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and led you forty years in the wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites.     <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 I raised up some of your sons to be prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and some of your youths to be Nazirites. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not this indeed so, Israelites? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But you made the Nazirites drink wine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and banned the prophets from prophesying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Listen! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is I who will make you groan in your places,       <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as a wagon groans under its load of grain.    <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Then flight will fail the swift,   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the strength of the strongest will be useless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The warrior will not save his life,   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 the archer will not stand firm, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the swift of foot will not escape, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the horseman will not save his life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 The bravest of warriors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; will flee away naked in that day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span></p><h6>The Basis of the Prophet’s Arraignment of Israel</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear this word <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken against you, Israelites, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; this is why I will punish you for your crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Do two walk together unless they agreed to meet? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Does a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Does a young lion cry out in his den unless he has caught something? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Does a bird swoop down into a trap if no bait is set for it? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Does a trap spring up from the ground if nothing sets it off? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Can a trumpet be blown in a city and the people not tremble? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Can disaster strike a city and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  not have caused it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Surely the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  does nothing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 The lion has roared; who does not fear? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  has spoken; who will not prophesy? </p><h6>The Guilt and Doom of Samaria</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and over the palaces in the land of Egypt: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Gather upon the mountain of Samaria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and see the violent turmoil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the acts of oppression in her midst. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 For they do not know how to do right. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They are heaping up violence and oppression in their palaces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v030003011" id="003011" >11</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  says:  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; An enemy will surround the land,      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he will strip your strength from you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and your palaces will be looted. 
<span class="verse" rel="v030003012" id="003012" >12</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; two shin-bones or a piece of an ear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with the corner of a couch, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the damask of a divan! <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v030003013" id="003013" >13</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear and testify against the house of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , the God of hosts. 
<span class="verse" rel="v030003014" id="003014" >14</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the horns of the altar will be hacked off, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they will fall to the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 I will destroy the winter houses together with the summer houses <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the houses of ivory will perish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Many great houses will be swept away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Listen to this message, women of Sameria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you well-fed cows of Bashan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who oppress the poor and crush the needy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who say to your husbands, “Bring us another drink!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  has sworn by his holiness: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; your children carried away in fish-baskets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 and through the breaches in the city wall you will go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; thrown out on the garbage dump, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. </p><h6>Israel’s Failure to Understand the Lord’s Judgments</h6><p> ********* <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Come to Bethel and transgress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At Gilgald increase your transgression; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring in the morning your sacrifices, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day your tithes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 And burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And proclaim aloud the voluntary offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For you love to do so, O Israelites! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the oracle of the Lord the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 But it was also I who gave to you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty stomachs in all your cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And lack of bread in all your palaces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet ye have not returned to me, is the oracle of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 I also it was who withheld from you the rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I sent rain upon one city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; While upon another I did not let it rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 I smote you with blight and mildew, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid waste your gardens and vineyards, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your fig and your olive trees the young locust devoured; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet you did not return to me, is the oracle of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 I sent among you a pestilence by the way of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I slew your youths with the sword, taking captive your horses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 I wrought a destruction among you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye were as a brand plucked from the burning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet ye did not return to me, is the oracle of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v030004012" id="004012" >12</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v030004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 For behold it is he who formeth the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And createth the wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And declareth to man what is his thought; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He maketh dawn and darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And treadeth upon the heights of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of hosts, is his name. <span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span></p><h6>Certain Destruction Awaiting Israel Unless She Seeks the Lord</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear the word which I take up against you, even a dirge, O house of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 And I will plant them upon their own soil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall never again be torn away from their land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I have given them, saith the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  thy God.
