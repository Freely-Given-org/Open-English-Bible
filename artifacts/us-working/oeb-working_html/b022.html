<span class="verse" rel="v022001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 O for a kiss from thy lips: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy caresses are better than wine. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Thy perfumes are fine in their fragrance; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As perfumes poured forth is thy name: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore the maidens (all) love thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Draw me after thee. O let us hasten: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O king, bring me into thy chamber. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In thee we will joy and be glad; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than wine shall we praise thy caresses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they are right who love thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 I am dark, but yet comely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye maids of Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like (dark) tents of Kedar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like curtains of Solomon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Eye me not strangely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I am dark: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis the sun that hath scorched me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the sons of my mother <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were angry with me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So they set me to watch the vineyards; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But the vineyard that was mine own <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched not at all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 O tell me, beloved of my soul, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where thou restest thy flock at the noon-tide; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For why should I wander in vain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be found by the flocks at the noon-tide; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For why should I wander in vain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be found by the flocks of thy comrades? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 If thou dost not know at all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou of women the fairest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Go forth on the trail of the flock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feed thy kids where the shepherds are tented. </p><h6>Dialogue</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 "I liken thee, O my love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a filly in Pharaoh’s chariot– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Thy cheeks all lovely with spangles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy neck with strings of jewels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 And circlets of gold we will make thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With pendants of silver." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 "While the king on his couch is reclining, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My spikenard yieldeth its fragrance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 A scent-bag of myrrh is my loved one, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That lieth between my breasts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 My love is a cluster of henna <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the vineyards of En-gedi." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 "O how fair, my love, art thou; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How fair, with thy dove-like eyes!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 "O how fair, my beloved, how lovely! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And green is our bed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Our house hath cedars for beams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our rafters are fir. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> A crocus of Sharon am I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lily of the valleys." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 "As a lily among the thorns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is my love among the sons. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In his shadow I sit with delight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his fruit is sweet to my taste." </p><h6>The Happiness of the Bride</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 To the house of wine he hath brought me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O’erhung with the banner of love. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Stay me with cakes of raisins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strengthen me with apples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For faint with love am I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 His left arm was under my head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his right arm round about me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 I adjure you, ye maids of Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the roes and the hinds of the field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That ye rouse not love nor awake her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until it be her good pleasure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Hark! my beloved! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See, he cometh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaping the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skipping the hills. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 See, there he standeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of our wall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I look from the window, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I peer though the latice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 And thus my beloved <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes answer to me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arise, my beloved, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fair, come away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 For see! the winter is past, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain is over and gone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 The flowers appear in the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time for pruning is come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of the ring-dove is heard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 The figs on the fig-trees are reddening, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vines are all blossom and fragrance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Arise, my beloved, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fair, come away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 O my dove, from thy craggy retreat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From thy hiding-place steep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O show me thy face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me hear thy voice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy voice is so sweet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy face is so lovely." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Take us the foxes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little foxes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That ruin our vineyards, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those blossoming vineyards. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 My beloved is mine, I am his: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Mong the lilies he pastures. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Till cool grows the day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shadows depart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O turn, my beloved, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sport like the roe <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the playful gazelle <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the cleft-riven mountains. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> On my bed in the night did I seek <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beloved of my soul. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I sought him in vain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 "I will rise and go over the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its streets and its squares. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will seek the beloved of my soul." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I sought him in vain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 I was met by the watchmen who passed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their round of the city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ("Tell me," I said), "Have ye seen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beloved of my soul?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Scarce had I parted from them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I found the beloved of my soul. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I held him and slacked not my hold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I brought him home to my mother. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 I adjure you, ye maids of Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the roes and the hinds of the field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That ye rouse not love nor awake her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Until it be her good pleasure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 What is this that comes up from the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like columns of smoke. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All scents of the merchant? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Behold, it is Solomon’s litter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And round it three score valiant men <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the valiant of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Each with a sword in his hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And acquainted with war– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Every man with a sword on his thigh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the terrors of night. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 The king had a palanquin made him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Lebanon wood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Its feet he had fashioned of silver; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its back was of gold. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Its seat was of purple: within <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was inlaid with ebony. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Come forth and look on the king, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye daughters of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crown he received from his mother, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day he was wedded <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With gladness of heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> How fair, my love, art thou, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thy dove-like eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind thy veil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hair like a flock of goats <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streaming down from mount Gilead; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 Thy teeth like a flock new shorn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just come up from the washing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranged in a double row, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one of them lacking; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 Thy lips like a scarlet thread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy mouth so lovely; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy temples like pieces of pomegranate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen through thy veil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Thy neck like the tower of David, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built for an armoury, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung with the thousand shields, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All shields of the valiant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Thy breasts like a pair of fawns <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That are twins of a roe! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Till the day grow cool <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shadows depart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go to the mountain of myrrh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hill of frankincense. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 O my love, thou art fair altogether; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no spot in thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Thou hast ravished me, sister and bride. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One glance of thine eyes hath bewitched me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One glint of thy necklace. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02200410a" id="00410a" >10a</span>
 How sweet thy caress, sister bride! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02200410b" id="00410b" >10b</span>
 How much better than wine thy caresses! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004Thy" id="004Thy" >Thy</span>
 lips, O my bride, drip with honey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And milk leith under thy tongue. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy garments are fragrant as Lebanon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02200410c" id="00410c" >10c</span>
 Thy perfumes are sweeter than balsam. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 A garden enclosed is my sister, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And garden enclosed, a sealed fountain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Thy shoots are a pomegranate paradise– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choicest of fruits, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Henna and spikenard, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v022004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Spikenard and saffron, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Calamus and cinnamon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all trees of incense, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloes and myrrh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the chief spices all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Thou art the fount of my garden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well of fresh water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like streamlets of Lebanon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 O North wind, awake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And come, thou South, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And blow on my garden, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That perfume be wafted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let my darling come into his garden <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And taste its choice fruits." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> I am come to my garden, my sister; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gather me balsam and myrrh. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tasted the comb with the honey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drunk of my wine and my milk. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Taste ye, my friends, and drink; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, drink yourselves drunken, beloved. </p><h6>The Bride tells her Tale</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 I slept, but my heart was awake. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O hark! my beloved is knocking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Open to me, my sister, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dove, my beloved, all spotless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For wet is my head with the dew, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my locks with the drops of the night." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 "I have laid my garment aside, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why should I don it again? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My feet, too, I have washed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why should I soil them again?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 My love put his hand through the opening, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And moved was my heart for him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 So I rose to let in my darling: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hands were dripping with myrrh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With the myrrh that ran over my fingers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the catch of the bolt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v022005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 I opened the door to my love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my darling had turned and was gone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the soul of me sank, when he vanished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought him, but all in vain: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called, but he gave me no answer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
