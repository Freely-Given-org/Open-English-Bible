<span class="verse" rel="v024001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 A message came to him from Jehovah in the  thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 king of Judah; and (such messages) continued to  come to him in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of  Josiah, king of Judah, and up to the end of the  eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of  Judah, when in the fifth month the people of  Jerusalem were swept into exile. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 This is the message that came to me from Jehovah: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 "My thoughts were upon thee before I created thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And before thou wast born I had set thee apart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And appointed thee unto the nations a prophet." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 And thus I made answer: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alas! O Lord Jehovah, Behold! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no skill of speech, I am only a child." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Then Jehovah made answer to me: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not plead thou art still but a child, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must go wheresoever I send thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And say whatsoever I bid thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Be not afraid at the sight of them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 For I will be with thee to save thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Thus spoke Jehovah; then with His outstretched hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He touched my mouth and said to me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Herewith do I put My words in thy mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Behold this day do I give thee authority <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the nations and over the kingdoms, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To uproot and demolish, destroy and tear down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To upbuild and to plant." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 This further message came to me from Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What seest thou there, Jeremiah?" (said the Voice). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 "A branch of an almond tree," I answered. "Thou <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; hast seen truly," said Jehovah," for I am watching? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; over My purpose, to perform it." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Then there came to me a second message from  Jehovah. "What seest thou now?" (said the  Voice). "A boiling pot," I answered, "facing the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 north." Then Jehovah said to me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the north shall disaster break forth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over all that inhabit the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 For I, saith Jehovah, do summon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The northern kingdoms all; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Each king shall come and set hi throne <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the gates that lead into Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And against her encircling walls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And against all the cities of Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 I will utter My judgments against them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their wickedness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Me they have forsaken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to to other gods offered sacrifice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bowed to the work of their hands. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v0240010As" id="0010As" >As</span>
 for thee, gird up thy loins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arise and declare unto them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatsoever I command thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the sight of them not dismay thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else I will dismay thee before them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 As for Me, behold! This day <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a fortified city I make thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A pillar of iron, a wall of bronze, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the whole of the land– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The kings and the courtiers of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priests and the folk of the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024001They" id="001They" >They</span>
 will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I – saith Jehovah most solemnly– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be with thee to save thee. </p><h6>The Earlier Messages of Jeremiah</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> There came to me this message from Jehovah: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the love of thy youth– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An affectionate bride wast thou– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou followedst Me in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A land that was all unsown; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Then Israel belonged to Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first-fruits, sacred to Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Whosoever devoured her was punished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On such did disaster fall. </p><h6>Her Ingratitude and Unparalleled Apostasy</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Hear the word of Jehovah, O household of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all ye families of the household of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What wrong did your fathers discover in Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they went from Me afar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow after vanities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they, too, becane a vanity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 And never sought afer Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who brought them up out of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And led them through the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A land of steppes and pits, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A land of drought and gloom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A land that no man traversed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lanf where no man dwelt? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 And I brought you into a garden-land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enjoy its fruits and its good things: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But ye came and defiled My land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And made Mine inheritance loathsome, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 No priest was heard any more <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enquiring afer Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They that handle the law did not know Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rulers rebelled against Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The prophets spoke by Baal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And followed useless idols. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 I must therefore contend with you still, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with your children’s children. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Pass across to the isles of Cyprus, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or send afar unto Kedar; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Note carefully, and see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath there ever been aught like this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Hath ever a nation exchanged its gods, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though they be no gods at all? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But My people hath exchanged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their Glory for useless idols. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Be appaled at this, ye heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shudder exceedingly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 For My people, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have done two evil things: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Me they have forsaken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fountain of Living Water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To hew for themselves leaking cisterns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can hold no water at all. </p><h6>The Consequences of Israel’s Apostasy</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Is Israel a servant? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is he a home-born slave? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why then hath he fallen a prey? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 And why are his cities wasted? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Young lions have roared against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lifted up their voice; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have made his land all desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no man dwelleth therein. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Yea, the people of Memphis and Daphnae <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have shorn the crown of thy head; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 And is this not come upon thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through forsaking Jehovah thy God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Now why dost thou wander to Egypt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink the waters of Nile? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And why dost thou go to Assyria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To drink of the streams of Euphrates? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Thy defection shall bring thee pain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy wickedness sore reproof; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt know and see for thyself <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a bitte thing it is <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To forsake Jehovah thy God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And to cherish no awe of Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts. </p><h6>Israel’s Devotion to Idolatry</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 For of old thou didst break thy yoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And burst thy bonds in sunder; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou saidst, "I refuse to serve:" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But high upon every hill <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And under every green tree <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou didst stretch thee, playing the harlot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Yet I as a choice vine had planted thee– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound was thy stock altogether; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But now art thou turned to be bitter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wild degenerate vine! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 For though thou shouldst wash thee with soda, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take thee abundance of soap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the Lord, as He seeth thy guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall declare it of deepest dye. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 How canst thou say, "All stainless am I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not gone after the Baals"? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at thy way in the Valley, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And know what thou hast done. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A swift young camel art thou, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That courseth hither and thither, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 A heifer run wild in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aglow with the heat of ther passion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That snifeth the wind in her longing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who can turn her back? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No one need wearily seek her– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her month she is sure to be found. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 Run not the shoes off thy feet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spare thy throat, lest it parch. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou saidst,"There is no hope – none: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am inlove with strangers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And after them will I go." </p><h6>The Impotence of the Gods solicited by Israel</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 But Israel’s house shall be shamed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a thief that is caught is ashamed– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They and their kings and their princes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their priests and their prophets together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 That say to a stock, "My father," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a stone, "It is thou that hast borne me." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For unto Me they turned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their backs and not their faces; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in time of trouble they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O rise Thou up and save us." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 But where are the gods thou didst make thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them arise, if they <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can save thee in time of trouble; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For as many as are thy cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many thy gods, O Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 Why do ye wrangle with Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For wicked ye are, every man of you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebels are ye, saith Jehovah– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebels against Me, each man of you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 In vain have I smitten your children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would not receive correction; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword hath devoured your prophets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a lion that dealeth destruction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 And yet ye are unafraid. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So hear ye the word of Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I been a desert to Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dark and gloomy land? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why then do ye say, "We are free, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will come unto Thee nevermore?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 Can a maid forget her ornaments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a bride forget her sash? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Me hath My people forgotten <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days and days without number. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002033" id="002033" >33</span>
 In quest of love how bravely <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou trippest along thy way! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Small wonder thy deeds are so vile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy way hath been all polluted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002034" id="002034" >34</span>
 Yea, blood was found in thy skirts– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the lives of the innocent poor– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As though thou hadst caught them at theft! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all this (I would therefore contend with thee); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002035" id="002035" >35</span>
 Yet thou hast said: "I am innocent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely His anger is over." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But see, I will enter with thee into judgment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou dost claim to be sinless. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002036" id="002036" >36</span>
 Why runnest thou hither and thither <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witg so frivolous a heart? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt yet reap shame from Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou has reaped shame from Assyria. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024002037" id="002037" >37</span>
 Yea, thence shalt thou also go forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thy hands upon thy head; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those whom thou trustest Jehovah hath spurned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou shalt not make good thine escape. </p><h6>Judah the Faithless</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> If a man divorceth his wife, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she goeth away from him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And becometh the wife of another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can she ever again be his? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is such a woman as she <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not altogether polluted? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bit thou hast played the harlot <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With many and many a lover; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And canst thou dare to dream <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of returning to Me, saith Jehovah? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Lift up thine eyes to the heights, and behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hast thou not been ravished? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast waited for them by the ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a Bedouin in the desert; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast stained the land by thy whoredoms, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by thy wicked ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 And through thy many lovers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast let thysef be snared. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast a harlot’s forhead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusing to be abashed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Yet but now has been calling Me Father <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Comrade of thy youth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 "Can He keep His anger for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or cherished it to the end? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, such were thy words; but they deeds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the last degree were vile. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 In the days of the King Josiah Jehovah said to me:  "Hast thou seem what back-sliding Israel did? She  went up on every high mountain and under every 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 green tree and ther she played the harlot. I had  hoped that, after all this, she would return to Me. But  no! she did not return. Her faithless sister Judah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 saw that I had put back-sliding Israel away because of  her adultery, and that I had given her a bill of divorce;  nevertheless faithless Judah was not at all afraid, but 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 she too went and played the harlot, defiling the land  by her wanton whoredom, and committing adultery 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 with stones and stocks. Nevertheless, when faithless  Judah turned to Me, it was not with her whole heart,  but only in pretence." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Then Jehovah said to me, "Backsliding Israel has 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 justified herself more than faithless Judah. Go and  proclaim these words towards the north and say:  O backsliding Israel, turn, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not look in anger upon thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am kind, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep not Mine anger for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 But only acknowledge thy guilt– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, disloyal to Jehovah thy God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast lavished thy love upon strangers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath every spreading tree, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And unto My voice, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast not inclined thine ear. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Return, ye backsliding children, saith Jehovah,  for I am your husband and lord; and I will take  one of you from each city and two from each clan, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 and I will brring you to Zion, and give you rulers after  My own mind, who shall tend you with wisdom and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 skill. And when in those days you have grown  numerous and fruitful in the land, saith Jehovah, men  shall speak no more of the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah; it shall never enter their minds, they will  neither think of it nor miss it, nor will they ever again  make another. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the Throne  of Jehovah, and all the nations shall gather thereto;  they shall follow no more the stubbornness of their 
<span class="verse" rel="v024003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 evil hearts. In those days the household of Judah  shall join the household of Israel, and together they  shall come from the north land to the land that I gave  your forefathers for an inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 How glad, methought, shall I be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give thee a place among sons, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To give thee a pleasant land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inheritance passing fair! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Me thought ye would call Me Father, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And follow Me evermore; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 But ye have been false unto Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a woman is false to her lover. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 Hark! weeping is heard on the heights– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is suppliant Israel crying, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they have walked perversely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting Jehovah their God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 "Return, ye backsliding I will heal." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Behold, we are come unto Thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou art Jehovah our God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 The hills are but a dellusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the orgies upon the mountains; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jehovah our God alone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Israel’s salvation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 The Baal hath devoured the toil <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our fathers from our youth– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sheep and their oxen together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sons and their daughters together <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 We would lay us down in our shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All covered with confusion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For before our God we have sinned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We and our fathers from youth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even unto this very day; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have not hearkened at all <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To the voice of Jehovah our God." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> "O Israel, if thou wilt return," saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou but return unto Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And put out of My sight those things that I loathe; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou raom not hither and thither; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 If sincerely and justly and truly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou swear, ’As Jehovah liveth,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then nations shall pray for a blessing like thine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in thee shall they make their boast. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah to the citizens of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to them that dwell in Jerusalem: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Break up the ground that lies fallow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sow ye not among thorns; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Circumcise ye your own selves to Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove from your hearts the foreskin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye citizens of Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye that dwell in Jerusalem; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest My fury go forth like fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And blaze beyond all quenching, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of your evil doings." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Declare ye this message in Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And publish it in Jerusalem; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow the trumpet throughout the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry aloud and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gather and let us betake ourselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the fortified cities." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Lift towards Zion a signal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flee ye for safety and stay out; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For disaster and fell destruction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I soon will bring out the north. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 A lion hath gone from his thicket; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Devastator of nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath left and gone forth from his place <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To desolate the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Gird yourselves therefore with sackcloth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make ye lament and wail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fierce glowing wrath of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth turn not away nor leave us. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 The heart of the king and the princes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall fail int that day, saith Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The priests shall be seized with horror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the prophets with amazement. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 They shall say "Ah, Lord Jehovah! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! Surely Thou hast deluded <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This people and Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuring us all would be well, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the doth pierce to the soul." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 This message shall then be declared <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Jerusalem and this people: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A glowing wind from the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cometh straight upon My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But not tp winnow or cleanse– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Too keen is the blast for that. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I will utter My judgment upon them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Behold! he mounteth as clouds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His chariots are like to the whirlwind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His horses are swifter than eagles: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Woe unto us! we are spoiled." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Wash thy heart of wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; How long wilt thou harbour within thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine evil imaginations? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Hark! a message from Dan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Mount Ephraim, evil tidings; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 Procalaim it among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And publish it over Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold! leopards are coming <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a land that is far away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They are raising loud their roar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the cities of Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 Lying in wait in the fields, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They beset her round and round– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because," declareth Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She hath rebelled against Me." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 Thy doings and thy behaviour <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have brought these things upon thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the fruit of thy wickedness– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bitter indeed it is, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It pierceth thy very heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 O the pain, the pain in my bosom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walls of my heart are athrob: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is a tumuly within me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot hold my peace; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sound of the trumpet I hear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The din and alarum of battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 Ruin doth break upon ruin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the land is laid waste; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My tents of a sudden are spoiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, all in a moment my curtains. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 How long must I look on the standard <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear the sound of the trumpet? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004022" id="004022" >22</span>
 For foolish is my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And me they do not know; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Sottish children they are, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoid of understanding: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise are they to do evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they know not how to do good. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004023" id="004023" >23</span>
 I looked at the earth, and behold! it was empty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at the heavens, and their light was gone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004024" id="004024" >24</span>
 I looked at the mountains, and lo! they were trembling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the hills moved to and fro. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004025" id="004025" >25</span>
 I looked and looked, but behold, there was no man, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the birds of the heaven had fled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004026" id="004026" >26</span>
 I looked at the fruit-land: behold! it was desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the cities were fallen in ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid waste by the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004027" id="004027" >27</span>
 For thus Jehovah hath said, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land shall be all desolation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004028" id="004028" >28</span>
 For this the earth shall mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the heavens above be black; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I have not repented My words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will not turn back from My purpose. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004029" id="004029" >29</span>
 At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole land taketh to flight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They enter the thickets and caves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climb up on to the rocks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Abandoned is very city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not a man dwelleth therein. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004030" id="004030" >30</span>
 Why, then, dost thou robe thee in scarlet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And deck thee with jewels of gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And paintest thine eyes to enlarge them? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain dost thou make thyself fair. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They that doted on thee despite thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thy life that they seek. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024004031" id="004031" >31</span>
 For a cry have I heard as of woman in travail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scream as of one bringing forth her first child. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! ’tis the daughter of Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That gaspeth and spreadeth her hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, "Ah! woe is me! I am faint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sinking – the victim of muderers." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Run to tand fro through the streets of Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look ye around and examine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Search in her open spaces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ye can find a man– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Any that acteth justly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seeketh after truth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I – Jehovah declareth– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will grant her My forgiveness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 But even when they say, "By Jehovah," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are ready to swear to a lie. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 Dost Thou look then, Jehovah, on falsehood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not upon the truth? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To all Thy blows they were callous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They refused to accept correction; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their faces were harder than stone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They refused to turn (and repent). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 "But these," thought I, "are the poor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people without understanding, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who know not the way of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordinance of their God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 I will get me unto the great men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And unto them will I speak; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they know the way of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordinance of their God." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But these very men have all broken the yoke, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And snapped the bonds asunder. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Soon therefore shall they be slain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a lion out of the forest; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wolf from the steppes shal despoil them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A leopard shall lurk by their cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rend all that issue therefrom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For many are their their transgressions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And far they have turned away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 How then for this can I pardon thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy children have forsaken Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Swearing by gods that are no gods; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, when to the full I had fed them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Adultery they committed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lodge in the houses of harlots. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Well fed stallions were they, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neighing each for his neighbour’s wife. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 And crimes like these, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I to leave unpunished? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not My soul be avenged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a nation such as this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Get ye up to her vines and destroy them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make an utter end of them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Take away her branches, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they are not Jehova’s. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 For utterly faithless to Me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the households of Israel and Judah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 They have denied Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, "He will never do it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No evil shall come upon us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall see neither sword nor famine. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 The prophets are only wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word is not in them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So be it done unto them." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, MY word in thy mouth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make like a flaming fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And this people shall be as the fuel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shall clean devour them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 Behold, I am bringing against you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O household of Israel, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nation from afar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; An imperishable nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very ancient nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A nation whose language thou knowest not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose speech is strange unto thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 Like an open grave is their quiver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And giants are they all: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 They shall eat up thy bread and thy harvest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall eat up thy sons thy daughters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall beat down the fortified cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein thou didst trust, with the sword. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 But in those days, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not make a clean end of you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 And in time to come, when ye say to Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why hath Jehovah our God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Done all these things unto us?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then shalt thou say unto them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "As ye have forsaken Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And served alien gods in your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So ye shall be servants to strangers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a land that is not your own." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 Declare ye this in the household of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And publish this message in Judah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Hear this, ye foolish and senseless people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With eyes that see not, and ears that hear not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005022" id="005022" >22</span>
 Fear ye not Me? saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tremble ye not at My presence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who hath set the sand as a bound for the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a barrier eternal which cannot be passed? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Its waters may toss, but they cannot prevail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its waves may roar, yet they cannot pass over it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005023" id="005023" >23</span>
 But these people are stubborn, defiant in heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are turned aside and gone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005024" id="005024" >24</span>
 For they do bot say in their hearts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us fear Jehovah, our God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who giveth the rain in its season, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early and latter rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And into us reseveth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the weeks appointed for harvest." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005025" id="005025" >25</span>
 This order your sins have disturbed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your crimes have withheld from you blessing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005026" id="005026" >26</span>
 For among My people are knaves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who set snares and with traps catch men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005027" id="005027" >27</span>
 Like a cage full of birds, so their houses <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are full of (the gains of) deceit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they grow great and rich, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005028" id="005028" >28</span>
 They are waxen fat, they are sleek: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They run riot in deeds of wickedness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They defend not the rights of the orphan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor champion the cause of the needy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005029" id="005029" >29</span>
 And things like these, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I to leave unpunished? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not My soul be avenged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a nation such as this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005030" id="005030" >30</span>
 An appailing, a horrible thing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is come to pass in the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024005031" id="005031" >31</span>
 The prophets prphesy falsely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from them do the priests take their teaching, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And My people love it so; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what will ye do in the end? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> Flee ye for safety, ye Benjamites, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the midst of Jerusalem; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow ye the trump in Tekoa, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise a beacon on Beth-haccherem: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For out of the north there peereth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disaster and fell destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v024006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 But shepherds shall come to assail her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They and their flocks together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall pitch their tents around about her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And graze on her, each were he camps. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hew ye down her trees, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast up a mound against her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to thee, City of Falsehood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within thee is nothing but tyranny. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 As a well keepeth fresh her waters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She keepeth her wickedness fresh; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Within her are rapine and violence heard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sickness and wounds are for ever before Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 O Jerusalem, be admonished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest My soul from thee be severed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest I make thee a desolation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unihabited land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Glean like a vine full thoroughly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that are left of Israel; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Set thy hand once more <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a vintager unto the branches." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 "But to whom shall I speak and bear witness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such wise that they listen? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For see! their ear is uncircumcised, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helpless are they to hearken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To them is the word of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become an utter scorn; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have no pleasure in it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 I am filled with the wrath of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am weary of holding it back: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On the child in the street I will pour it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On youths, too, where’er they assemble; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall smite men and women alike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the aged, whose days are many. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 Their homes shall be turned unto others, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fields and their wives together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For against those that dwell in the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will stretch out My hand, saith Jehovah." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 For great and small alike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all of them greedy of gain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet and priest alike– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every man of them practiseth falsehood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 They would heal the hurt of My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As though it were but slight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is well, it is well," they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it is anything but well." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 Are they at all abashed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At their deeds abominable? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, they are unabashed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They know not how to blush. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall therefore fall with the fallen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hour of their visitation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall stumble, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 Thus did Jehovah say: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand in the ways and see, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ask for the ancient paths; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark that which leadeth to happiness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See that ye walk therein– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye shall find rest to your souls. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they said, " We refuse to walk in it." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 And over you I set watchmen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying "Hark for the sound of the trumpet." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they said, "We refuse to hearken." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 Wherefore hearken, ye nations, and hear, O earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take knowledge of that which is coming. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 Behold, I will bring on this people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disaster, the fruits of their backsliding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they heeded not My words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My instruction they rejected. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 Of what avail to Me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the incense that cometh from Sheba, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweet cane from a distant land? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept not yout burnt-offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sacrifice pleaseth Me not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 Therefore, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set on the way of this people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Stones over which they may stumble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over them stumble they shall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fathers and sons together– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And neighbour and friend shall perish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006022" id="006022" >22</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah, Behold! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A people doth come from the north land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A mighty nation is stirring <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the uttermost ends of the earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006023" id="006023" >23</span>
 Bow they wield and javelin– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruel and pitiless they, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With a voice like the roar of the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they ride upon horses and chariots, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrayed, like one man, for the battle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against thee, O daughter of Zion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006024" id="006024" >24</span>
 The rumour thereof we have heard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all unnerved are we: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Anguish hath seized upon us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pangs as of women in travail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006025" id="006025" >25</span>
 Venture not forth to the open, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go not abroad on the highway; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is the sword of the enemy– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror on every side. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006026" id="006026" >26</span>
 O daughter of My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Gird thee about with sackcloth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sprinkle thee with ashes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Make mourning and bitter lament, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for an only son; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For suddenly shall come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Devastator upon us. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006027" id="006027" >27</span>
 I have set thee to test My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To discover and test their way. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024006028" id="006028" >28</span>
 Refractory are the all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They slander as they go; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all of them brass amd iron, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all of them corrupt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Fiercely the bellows blow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lead is consumed by the fire; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But in vain doth the smelter keep smelting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dross is not smelted away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Their name shall be refuse silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For them hath Jehovah as refuse rejected. </p><h6>Messages from the Middle Period of Jeremiah’s Career</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 Take thy stand at the gate of the Temple, and there  make the following proclamation. Say, Listen to  this message from Jehovah, all ye men of Judah that 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 enter these gates to worship Jehovah. Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways  and your doings, and I will guarantee this place as your 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 permanent home. But put no trust in lying messen-  gers, who say: "This is the Temple of Jehovah, the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah." For if  you really amend your ways and your doings: if  you really do justice as between man and man; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 if you abstain from the oppression of the resident  alien, the fatherless and the widow, from the shed-  ding of innocent blood in this place, and from devotion 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 to other gods to your own hurt, then I will guarantee  you a home here for all time in the land that I gave  your forefathers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 But see, you are putting your trust in doctrines that 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 are as profitless as they are false. What! you commit  theft, murder, adultery, perjury, you burn sacrifice  to the Baal, you run after other gods that are 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 strange to you; and then you (have the hardihood  to) come and stand before me in this House which is  called by My name, and say, "Now we are safe" – in  order, forsooth, to carry on all these abominations. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 This House which bears My name you regard, do you,  as nothing but a robbers’ cave? Make no mistake:  I – saith Jehovah – I have not been blind to all this. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 I would ask you to visit My sanctuary in Shiloh,  where I put My name at the first, and see what the  wickedness of My people Israel constrained Me to do 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 to it. And so it will be now, saith Jehovah. Because  you have perpetrated all these anormities, in defiance  of My most earnest and repeated words, and have 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 refused to respond to My call, therefore this Temple  in which you repose your trust – called by My name  though it be – and the place that I gave to you and  your forefathers, I will consign to the same fate as 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 overtook Shiloh; and I will hurl you out of My sight  as I have hurled your brethren, the whole race of  Ephraim. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raise  no cry or prayer on their behalf, and make no inter- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 cession to Me, for I will not listen to thee. Seest thou  not what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007018" id="007018" >18</span>
 the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood,  the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough,  to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour  out drink-offerings to other gods, in order to vex Me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007019" id="007019" >19</span>
 Is it I, then, saith Jehovah, whom they are vexing?  is it not rather themselves, doomed as they are to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 bring confusion upon their own faces/. Therefore,  thus saith the Lord Jehovah, "My anger and My  fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man  and beast, upon trees of the field and fruit of the ground,  and it shall blaze in unquenchable flame." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007021" id="007021" >21</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel,  Put the flesh of your burnt-offerings and your  (other) sacrifices together, and make a common meal 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007022" id="007022" >22</span>
 of them both alike; for on the day that I brought your  forefathers out of the land of Egypt, I gave them no  commandment nor did I utter a syllable with regard to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007023" id="007023" >23</span>
 burnt offering or sacrifice. But the commandment I  gave them was this: Listen, I said, to My voice, and  then I will be your God and you shall be My people,  and take My commandments as the standard of all 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 your life – this is the way to prosperity. But, instead  of inclining their ear and listening, they followed the  dictates of their own stubborn and wicked hearts; they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 went backwards instead of forwards. Ever since your  forefathers came out of the land of Egypt, every day up  to this very day I have been sending you early and late 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 all My servants the prophets. Instead, however,  of inclining their ear, they stiffened their necks and  behaved worse than their forefathers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007027" id="007027" >27</span>
 This, then, is the message thou art to address to  them, though they will not listen to thee, nor respond 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007028" id="007028" >28</span>
 to thy call – thy message is to be this: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the folk that refused to listen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the voice of Jehovah their God– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That refused to accept correction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerity is vanished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is found on their lips no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024007029" id="007029" >29</span>
 Shear off thy locks – away with them– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift up a dirge on the heights: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah hath spurned and forsaken <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The race that hath roused Him to anger. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007030" id="007030" >30</span>
 The people of Judah, saith Jehovah, have done the  thing I abhor: the very House that bears My name  they have defiled by introducing into it their abomin- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007031" id="007031" >31</span>
 able worship. They have built a sanctuary of Topheth  in the Valley of the son of Hinnom, for the burning of  their sons and daughters in the fire, though this was  no commandment of Mine – such a thing never entered  into My mind. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024007032" id="007032" >32</span>
 Mark this therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah,  when it shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valley  of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, and  Topheth shall be used as a burial-place for want of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007033" id="007033" >33</span>
 room (elsewhere). The dead bodies of this people  shall be devoured by the birds of the air and the beasts 
<span class="verse" rel="v024007034" id="007034" >34</span>
 of the earth, and none shall scare them away. In the  cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem I will  still the voice of mirth and gladness, and the voice of  bridegroom and bride; for the land shall become a waste. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> At the time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out of  their graves the bones of the kings, the princes, the  priests, and the prophets, of Judah, and of the in- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 habitants of Jerusalem, and they shall spread them  before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven,  whom they loved and served and followed and sought  and worshipped; and they shall remain ungathered  and unburried, they shall be for dung on the face of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 ground. And in all places to which I have driven them,  every man that is left of this evil family would choose  rather death than life, saith Jehovah of Hosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth not one who has fallen rise up again, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one who hath wandered turn back again? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 Why, then, doth thy people keep turning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever and ever backward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinging to ways deceitful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusing to return? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 I have listened with ear intent– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their words are utterly false. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a man repents of his wickedness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or thinks upon what he has done: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But each rushes on in his course <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a war-horse rushes in battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 The very stork in the heavens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth know her appointed seasons; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The turtle, the swift, and the swallow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe the time of their coming: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But the ordinance of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My people doth not know. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 How can ye say, "We are wise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with us is the law of Jehovah"? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For see! the false pen of the sribes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath turned it into a falsehood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 So the wise shall be put to shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be dismayed and taken captive. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have spurned the word of Jehovah– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What manner of wisdom have they? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 So their wives I will give unto others, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conquerors their fields. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For, great and small alike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all of them greedy of gain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet and priest alike– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every man of them practiseth falsehood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 They would heal the hurt of My people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As though it were but slight; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is well, it is well," they say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it is anything but well." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 Are they at all abashed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At their deeds abominable? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, they are unabashed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They know not how to blush. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall therefore fall with the fallen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hour of their visitation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall stumble, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 When I, saith Jehovah, would gather their fruit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not a grape on the vine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not a fig on the fig-tree, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All withered are the leaves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 "Why are we sitting still? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assemble yourselves together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us enter the fortified cities, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there let us meet our doom; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah our God hath doomed us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath given us gall to drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we have sinned against Him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 We wait for peace, but no good cometh; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a season of healing, but lo! dismay." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 From Dan is heard the snort of his steeds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sound of his stallions neighing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the land doth tremble. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They come and devour the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that is therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city and her inhabitants. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 For see! I will send amongst you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serpents of basilik order, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cannot be charmed at all; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they, saith Jehovah, shall bite you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 Past healing is my sorrow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is heavy within me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 Hark! a voice is calling <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the daughter of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a land that is far away: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is not Jehovah in Zion? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not her King therein?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "With their images why have they vexed Me– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With futile foreign gods?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all unsaved are we." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 For the daughter of my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All broken, mine own heart is broken; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I go about in mourning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the clutch of horror upon me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 Is there no balm in Gilead? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there no physician there? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why cometh then no healing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the daughter of my people? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> O that my head were waters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mine eyes a fountain of tears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That day and night I might weep <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the slain of the daughter of my people! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 O that I had in the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spot such as travellers lodge in; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For then would I leave my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, from them I would go; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they be all adulterers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A company of traitors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That bend their tongue like a bow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 It is not the true, but the false, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That has mastery in the land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they pass from evil to evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they know not Me, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 Let each man beware of his neighbour, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And trust not any brother: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For brothers are tricksters, all of them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And neighbours are slanderers all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 They all deceive one another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth they will not speak; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have taught their tongue to lie, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They behave like knaves and fools. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 Oppression upon oppression, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deceit upon deceit: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They refuse, saith Jehovah, to know Me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold I will smelt them and test them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For alas! I must turn Mine eyes away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the daughter of My people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 Their tongue is a deadly arrow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words of their mouth are deceit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They speak their neighbour fair, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at heart they are laying a trap for him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 And crimes like these, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I to leave unpunished? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not My soul be avenged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a nation such as this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 Lift a lament for the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dirge for the wilderness pastures; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For wasted they lie and untraversed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No lowing of cattle they hear: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds of the air and the beasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are fled away and gone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 I will make of Jerusalem ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place for jackals to haunt; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make of the cities of judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An uninhabited waste. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 Where is the man that Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Himself hath communed with and charged <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To declare why the land us a ruin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid waste like the untravelled wilderness? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 And Jehovah said unto me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they forsook My law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I had set before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And did not live thereby, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But disobeyed My voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 And followed their stubborn hearts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Baals that their fathers had taught them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Israel; Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will feed this people with wormwood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And give them gall to drink. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 I will scatter them far among nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To them and their fathers unknown; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword I will send to pursue them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I have clean consumed them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Now mark ye well and summon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women that chant in dirges; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And send for the skillful women, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they may come in haste, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 And lift up for us a lament; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That our eyes may run with tears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our eyelids gush with water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 Hark! from Zion float sounds of wailing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alas!how are we spoiled; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We are put to utter shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we have left the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our homes are hurled to the ground." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 Hear then, ye women, the word of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Received with your ears the word of His mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And teach this lament to your daughters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each one to her neighbour this dirge: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 "Death hath climbed up to our windows, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And into our palaces entered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sweeping the child from the streets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the youth from the broad open spaces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 The corpses of men are fallen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like dung on the face of the field; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or like sheaves behind the reaper, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With none to gather them up." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the wise man not boast of his wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the strong man not boast of his strength; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the rich man not boast of his riches, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 But in this be the boaster’s boast– <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In insight and knowledge of Me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Jehovah, who over the earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Doeth kindness and justice and right; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these are the things that I love. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 Mark this well, saith Jehovah: days are coming  when I will punish all those that, though circumcised 
<span class="verse" rel="v024009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 (in flesh) are uncircumcised (in heart) – Egypt, Judah,  Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all those denizens of the  wilderness that have the corners of their hair clipped;  for while all the nations are uncircumcised, the whole  household of Israel is uncircumcised in heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span>
<span class="verse" rel="v024010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 Take up thy pack from the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (O Jerusalem), that sittest beleaguered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This time I will surely sling out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabitants of the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring them into such straits <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That they shall melt for fear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 Ah! woe is me! I am broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And smitten very sore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is a stroke indeed," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said I, "and I must bear it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 My tent is despoiled and perished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my cords are broken; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My flock is vanished clean. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none to stretch my tent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to hang up my curtains more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 For the shepherds are foolish grown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing they care for Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For this cause they have not prospered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all their flock is scattered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 Hark! a rumour! behold, it cometh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mighty uproar from the land of the north, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall make of the cities of Judah a waste, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place to be haunted of jackals. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010023" id="010023" >23</span>
 Well, O Jehovah, I know <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a man’s way lies not with himself;` <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not in the power of man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To walk and direct his steps. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010024" id="010024" >24</span>
 When therefore Thou chastenest us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Thou deal, O Jehovah, in measure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And not in Thine indignation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For so wouldst Thou bring us to nothing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010025" id="010025" >25</span>
 Pour out Thy wrath on the heathen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That have not cared for Thee– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on tribes that invoke not Thy name; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jacob they have devoured, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have desolated his dwelling. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> Listen, O household of Israel, to the word which Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 hath spoken to you. Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn not the ways of the heathen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be not dismayed at the signs in the sky, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As the heathen are dismayed; <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 For heathen religion is vapour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A tree is cut down in the forest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fashioned by craftsman’s axe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02401004a" id="01004a" >4a</span>
 Adorned with silver and gold– <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 With silver beat fine, brought from Tarshish, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And gold that cometh form Ophir– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wrought by the craftsman and goldsmith, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And robed in blue and in purple– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of skilled men are they all– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02401004b" id="01004b" >4b</span>
 And fastened with nails and hammers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep them from toppling over. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 They are altogether dumb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a scarecrow in garden of cucumbers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Carried they must needs be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they cannot go of themselves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Be not afraid of them, then, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they have it not in their power <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do either good or harm. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 There is none like Thee, O Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art great, and great is Thy name in might. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 Who should not fear Thee, O King of the nations? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thee it becometh well; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For among the wise men of the nations all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And among their kingdoms all, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none that is like unto Thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 One and all, they are senseless and silly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructed of gods that are wooden. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 But Jehovah is God indeed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A living God, and a King everlasting; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth at His wrath doth tremble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His anger no nation can bear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 He created the earth by His power, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He established the world by His wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stretched out the heavens by His skill. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 When He uttereth His voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waters roar in the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And He causeth vapour to rise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the uttermost ends of the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightnings He made for the rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wind He brings out of His storehouses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 How foolish is man with his knowledge! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goldsmith is shamed by his image; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His idols are delusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010015" id="010015" >15</span>
 They are an empty mockery, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hour of their trial they shall perish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 Not such is the Portion of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His God is the Framer of all things: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah of Hosts is His name. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 "Listen to the words of this covenant, and declare  them to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 Jerusalem. Say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God  of Israel: Accursed be the man that refuses to listen 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 to the words of the covenant with which I charged your  forefathers on the day that I brought them out of that  iron furnace, the land of Egypt. I promised them then  that, if they obeyed My voice, and conformed to all  My commandments, they should be My people and I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 would be their God, and thus the oath would be estab-  lished that swore to their forefathers – to give them  a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."  Then I answered and said, "Amen, Jehovah." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 Jehovah then said to me, "Make this proclamation  throughout the cities of Judah and in the streets of  Jerusalem: Listen to the words of this covenant and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 act upon them. For early and late, ever since the day  that I brought your forefathers out of the land of  Egypt up to this day, I have been earnestly adjuring 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 them to listen to My voice; but instead of obediently  inclining their ear, every man of them followed the  dictates of his own wicked and stubborn heart; so I  brought upon them all the threats of this covenant  which I had charged them to observe, but which they  failed to observe." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 Further Jehovah said to me, "The people of Judah  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been engaged in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 a manifest conspiracy (against Me). They have  reverted to the sins of their forefathers who refused to  listen to My words, and they are actually indulging in  the worship of other gods: the households of Israel  and Judah alike have broken the covenant I made with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 their forefathers. Therefore thus saith Jehovah:  Mark this – I will bring upon them a disaster which they  shall be powerless to escape; and when they cry to Me, U 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 will turn a deaf ear. Then the cities of Judah and the  inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods to  whom they burn sacrifice; but no help shall they get 
<span class="verse" rel="v024011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 from them in the day of their calamity: for your gods,  O Judah, are as numerous as your cities; and as  numerous as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you  have set up for sacrifice in the scandalous worship  of the Baal. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 As for thyself, offer no prayer for this people, raise  no cry or prayer on their behalf; for I will not listed  when they call to Me in the day of their calamity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 What business hath My Beloved <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In My house, after conduct so vile? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall vows and the sacred flesh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avert from thee thy doom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then mightest thou rejoice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 A spreading, graceful olive <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah had called thy name; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the roar of a mighty storm <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath set it ablaze with lightning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the branches thereof are marred. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 For Jehovah of Hosts that planted thee hath pro-  nounced evil against thee in requital for th evil in which  the households of Israel and Judah have vexatiously  indulged, by burning sacrifice to the Baal." </p><h6>The plot</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011018" id="011018" >18</span>
 I knew – for Jehovah had told me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And revealed to me what they were doing: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011019" id="011019" >19</span>
 But I – like an innocent lamb <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is led to the slaughter was I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, all unconscious was I <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the plots they were plotting against me– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ruin the tree with its sap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the land of the living to root me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And banish my name out of mind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 But Jehovah of Hosts, Thou righteous Judge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who mind and heart dost prove, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me see Thy vengeance upon them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For on Thee have I rolled my cause. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011021" id="011021" >21</span>
 Therefore, thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathoth who seek thy life and threaten thee with <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; death at their hands, if thou preach in the name of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011022" id="011022" >22</span>
 Therefore saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold I will visit them sternly; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their young men shall die by the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sons and their daughters shall perish with hunger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024011023" id="011023" >23</span>
 Not one of them shall be left; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For over the men of Anathoth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Calamity I will bring <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year of their visitation. </p><h6>Jeremiah’s Persplexity and Prayer for Vengeance</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> "Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I make my plaint unto Thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the case I would reason with Thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do the wicked prosper? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why do the faithless all flourish? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 Thou plantest them, yea, they take root; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spread, yea, they bring forth fruit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You are always on their lips, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But far, far away from their hearts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 But Thou, O Jehovah, dost know me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart towards Thee Thou hast proved. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull them out, then, like sheep for the slaughter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the day of slaughter devote them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 How long must the land still mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the herbs of the fields be all withered? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Beast and bid are vanished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the sin of her people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who think God is blind to their ways." </p><h6>The Divine Answer</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 "If thy race with the footmen hath wearied thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wilt thou vie with the horse? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou takest to flight in a land that is safe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then how wilt thou do on the jungle of Jordan? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 For thy father’s household, thine own very brethren, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even they have played thee false. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They pursue thee with clamours loud: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust them not, when they speak thee fair." </p><h6>The Havoc</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 My house I have forsaken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heritage I have cast off; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the hands of her foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given the Beloved of My soul. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012008" id="012008" >8</span>
 My darling is grown to Me (fierce) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a lion in the jungle; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She hath lifted her voice against Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore I abhor her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 Is My darling a speckled bird, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the birds circle round and assail her? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, all ye beasts of the field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come hither to devour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 Shepherds many have ruined My vineyard, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And trampled My ground under foot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have turned My pleasant inheritance <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into a desolate wilderness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 They have made it a desolation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It mourneth, ah me! all desolate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Desolate all is the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one cares. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 Upon all the bare heights in the wilderness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoilers have descended; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sword of Jehovah devours <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From one end of the land to another; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No peace is there for any. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 Wheat they have sown, but thorns they have reaped; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their labour hath profited nothing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their harvest shall bring them to shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of Jehovah’s hot anger. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 This is the word of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To all Mine evil neighbours <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That put forth a hand on the heritage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave to My people Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold! I will pluck them away from their land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the household of Judah I pluck from the midst of them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 But when thus I have plucked them away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will once more take pity upon them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring each man back to his heritage, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each to his own land again. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 And if ever they master the ways of My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To swear by My name, "As Jehovah liveth," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As they once taught My people to swear by the Baal, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall then be built up in the midst of My people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 But the nation that will not listen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will pluck clean away and destroy, saith Jehovah. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> Jehovah told me to go and buy a linen waistcloth and  put it on my loins, taking care not to let it get into 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 water. So I bought a waistcloth, as Jehovah had  bidden me, and I put it on my loins. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 Then a second message from Jehovah came to me, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 telling me to take the waistcloth I had bought, that  was on my loins, and to proceed to Parah and bury it 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 there in a chink of the rock. So I went and burried it 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 at Parah, as Jehovah had charged me. Many days  after, Jehovah told me to proceed to Parah and remove  the waistcloth which He had charged me to bury there. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013007" id="013007" >7</span>
 Then I went to Parah and dug out and took the linen  waistcloth from the place where I had buried it; and  lo! the waistcloth was ruined – it was good for  nothing. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 Then there came to me this word from Jehovah: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013009" id="013009" >9</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah, Ruin like this I will bring upon the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013010" id="013010" >10</span>
 soaring pride of Judah and Jerusalem. As for these  depraved people who, refusing to listen to My words,  follow the dictates of their own stubborn hearts and  indulge in the worship and service of other gods – let  them become like this waistcloth, good for nothing. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013011" id="013011" >11</span>
 For, as the waistcloth clings to a man’s loins, so would  I have had the whole household of Israel and Judah  cling unto Me, saith Jehovah, to be My people, a  source of renown and praise and glory: but they would  not listen. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024013012" id="013012" >12</span>
 Take to them therefore this message: Thus saith  Jehovah the God of Israel, "Every jar must be filled with  wine." And if they say to thee, "Why, of course we 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013013" id="013013" >13</span>
 know that every jar must be filled with wine," then this  is what thou shalt say to them: Thus saith Jehovah:  Soon-mark it well-I will fill with drunkenness all  the inhabitants of this land – the kings that sit upon  the throne of David, the priests, the prophets, and all 
<span class="verse" rel="v024013014" id="013014" >14</span>
 the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will dash them,  saith Jehovah, one against another, fathers and sons  together. I will neither spare nor pity: no compassion  shall restrain Me from destroying them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013015" id="013015" >15</span>
 O hear and give ear, be not haughty; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah hath spoken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013016" id="013016" >16</span>
 To Jehovah your God give ye glory, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it grows dark, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And ere yet, on the mountains of twilight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With feet that are stumbling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye look for the light, which to gloom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thick darkness He turneth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013017" id="013017" >17</span>
 But should ye refuse to give heed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in secret my soul shall weep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of your pride: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And with tears that flow ever and ever <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes shall run down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the flock of Jehovah, afar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To captivity taken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013018" id="013018" >18</span>
 Say to the King and the Queen Mother, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low ye be seated; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For down from your head hath been hurled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your glorious crown. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013019" id="013019" >19</span>
 The towns in the south land are shut, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no one to open them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All Judah is swept into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swept all into exile. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013020" id="013020" >20</span>
 Jerusalem, lift up thine eyes and behold <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How they come from the north. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is thy beautiful flock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the sheep that were given thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013021" id="013021" >21</span>
 What wilt thou say when He calleth– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lord over thee– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The men thou thyself didst instruct <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To approach thee as lovers? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall anguish not clutch at thee hard <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of woman in travail? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013022" id="013022" >22</span>
 But if in thy heart thou shouldst say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this come upon me?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy manifold guilt is the cause <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thy skirts are stripped off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy modesty outraged. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013023" id="013023" >23</span>
 Can the African change his skin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the leopard his spots? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as helpless art thou to do good <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That art wont to do evil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013024" id="013024" >24</span>
 And so to the winds of the desert <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like stubble that flies I will scatter them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013025" id="013025" >25</span>
 This is thy lot, this the portion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I measure to thee, saith Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou forgattest Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hast trusted in falsehood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024013026" id="013026" >26</span>
 Thy skirt I Myself will lift over thy face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thy shame may be seen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Thine adulteries and thy neighings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy harlotry foul– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the field, on the hills, I have seen– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy detestable doings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; How long time yet must pass <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until thou be cleansed? </p><h6>The Distress of the Drought</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> The message which came from Jehovah to Jeremiah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with regard to the drought. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Judah doth mourn, and the gates thereof languish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Her people) are sitting in black on the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a cry rises up from Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 Her nobles have sent their attendants for water; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They come to the cisterns, no water they find: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then they go with their pitches empty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In shame and confusion they cover their heads. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 Dismayed are the men that till the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because on the land no rain hath fallen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ploughmen cover their heads in confusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 Yea, even the hind in the field forsaketh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young that she bore, because grass there is none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 And the wild asses stand on the bleak bare heights, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panting for air, like the crocodile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the light dieth out of their eyes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because herbage there is none. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Supplication</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014007" id="014007" >7</span>
 And yet though our sins rise in witness against us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah, O act, for Thine own name’s sake; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For many a time have we turned from Thee back, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And against Thee we have sinned. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 O Thou that art Israel’s Hope, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Saviour in time of trouble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why like a stranger art Thou in Thy land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a traveller who turneth to lodge but a night? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014009" id="014009" >9</span>
 Why shouldst Thou be like a man fast asleep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a warrior powerless to save? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Thou, O Jehovah, art here in our midst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By thy name we are called: O leave us not. </p><h6>The Divine Answer</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 Touching this people Jehovah thus answered: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus do they love to wander <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With unrestrained feet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jehovah cannot accept them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their guilt He now calleth to mind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sins He will visit with chastisement. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 And Jehovah said to me: Offer no prayer for the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 welfare of this people. When they fast, I will be deaf <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to their cry; when they offer burnt-offerings and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; cereal offerings, I will not accept them. By sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; by famine, by pestilence, I will consume them. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Remonstrance</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 To this I made answer: Oh! Lord Jehovah, see!  The prophets are ceaselessly telling them that they will  never see the sword or suffer from famine, but that  Thou wilt bestow upon them stable peace in this place. </p><h6>The Divine Answer</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024014014" id="014014" >14</span>
 Then Jehovah said to me: The prophets are but  preaching lies in My name. I never sent them; they  have no commission from Me; not a word have I  spoken to them. What thy preach to you is nothing  but a tissue of lying visions and idle divinations and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024014015" id="014015" >15</span>
 inventions of their own deceitful hearts. This there-  fore is the message of Jehovah concerning those  prophets who, without any commision from Me, are  ceaselessly preaching that this land will never suffer  from sword or famine: by sword and famine shall 
<span class="verse" rel="v024014016" id="014016" >16</span>
 those very prophets themselves be consumed, and the  people they preach to shall be flung out in the streets  of Jerusalem as victims of sword and famine, and they  shall lie unburied – themselves, their wives, their sons,  their daughters; for I will pour their wickedness over  them. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Lament and Confession</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024014017" id="014017" >17</span>
 This is the word thou shalt speak to them: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes run down with tears <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By night and day unceasing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the daughters of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is broken, grievously broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a wound exceeding sore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014018" id="014018" >18</span>
 If to the field I go forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, the slain of the sword lie there; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And if into the city I go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, there lie the victims of famine: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, prophet and priest alike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All wiltless, lie crouched on the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014019" id="014019" >19</span>
 Hast Thou utterly cast away Judah? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Zion grown loathsome to Thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why hast Thou smitten us so, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we can find no healing? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We look for peace, but no good cometh: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a season of healing, but lo! dismay. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014020" id="014020" >20</span>
 We acknowledge, Jehovah, our wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guilt of our fathers also; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For we have sinned against Thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014021" id="014021" >21</span>
 For Thy name’s sake, O spurn us not, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O shame not Thy glorious throne: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O remember and break out Thy covenant with us. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024014022" id="014022" >22</span>
 Of the worthless gods of the heathen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there one that can bring down rain? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the sky give showers of itself? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not Thou alone that canst do this– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah, our God, whom we wait for? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, these things are all Thy creation. </p><h6>The Divine Answer – Rejection and Doom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="015001">15</span> Then Jehovah said to me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet no learning of heart could I have for this people; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away with them out of My sight – let them go. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 When they ask thee where they shall go, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then say to them, Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To death, those destined to death; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sword, those doomed to the sword; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To famine, those destined to famine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To exile, those destined to exile. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015003" id="015003" >3</span>
 And I, saith Jehovah, will set over them four kinds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (of destroyers) – the sword to slay, the dogs to tear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the birds of the air to devour, and the beasts of the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015004" id="015004" >4</span>
 earth to destroy; and I will make them an object of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Consternation to every kingdom in the world, in return <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for all the evil wrought in Jerusalem by Manasseh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015005" id="015005" >5</span>
 O Jerusalem, who will then pity thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will commiserate thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will go out of his way <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enquire how it fareth with thee? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015006" id="015006" >6</span>
 Thou hast cast Me off, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou ever wentest backward; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So, weary at length of relenting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stretch out My hand to destroy thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015007" id="015007" >7</span>
 With winnowing-fork I will winnow thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every gate of the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make My people childless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And destroy them because of their wickedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02401508c" id="01508c" >8c</span>
 A destroyer I will bring <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mother and suckling at noon-day; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will bring of a sudden upon her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agitation and dismay. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015009" id="015009" >9</span>
 The mother of seven shall languish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she shall swoon away; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sun shall go down in the day-time, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashamed and abashed shall she be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Their widows are more in number <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 To the sword in the face of their foes. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Passionate Lament</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015010" id="015010" >10</span>
 Alas for me! mother of mine, that bore me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To strive and to struggle with all the world. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Never lender nor borrower was I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet one and all they curse me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015011" id="015011" >11</span>
 To their curses be "Amen, Jehovah," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever I failed to entreat Thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a blessing upon my foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their time of distress and disaster. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015012" id="015012" >12</span>
 Is the arm in my shoulder of iron? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is my brow of brass? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015015" id="015015" >15</span>
 O Jehovah, remember and visit me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avenge me of my tormentors; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let not Thine anger tarry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethink Thee – it is in Thy cause <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have been laden with insult. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024015016" id="015016" >16</span>
 They spurn Thy words – every man of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But to me is Thy word a delight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very joy of my heart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I have been called by Thy name, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Jehovah, Thou God of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015017" id="015017" >17</span>
 No happy seat was mine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At gatherings of the merry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But lonely I sat, for Thy hand was upon me: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With (holy) wrath Thou hast filled me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015018" id="015018" >18</span>
 Oh why is my pain unceasing? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why is this wound of mine cureless? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a treacherous brook wilt Thou be unto me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like waters that are unsure? </p><h6>The Divine Answer</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015019" id="015019" >19</span>
 Thus therefore saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou turn again, I will restore thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou shalt be My servant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy speech but be noble, not petty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so thou shalt be My mouthpiece; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They then may turn unto thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou shalt not turn unto them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015020" id="015020" >20</span>
 And unto this folk I will make thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fortified wall of bronze. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They will fight thee, but thou shalt be victor; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I will be with thee to save thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rescue thee – thus saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024015021" id="015021" >21</span>
 Yes, I from the land of the wicked will rescue thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I from the clutch of the cruel will redeem thee. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Unutterable Loneliness</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> There came to me this message from Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016002" id="016002" >2</span>
 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shalt thou have any sons <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or daughters in this place. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016003" id="016003" >3</span>
 For thus Jehovah saith <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the sons and the daughters <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That in this place are born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And concerning the mothers that bore them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fathers that begat them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016004" id="016004" >4</span>
 "A grievous death shall they die, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unburied, unlamented; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like dung on the face of the field shall they be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall perish by sword and famine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; By the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall their corpses be devoured." </p><h6>The National Doom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016005" id="016005" >5</span>
 For thus Jehovah saith: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not enter the house of grief, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor go to make lament, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And raise for them no wailing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because from this (My) people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have taken away My peace. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016006" id="016006" >6</span>
 Both great and small in this land shall die, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall be unburried, unmourned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a man shall gash his body, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or shear his hair for them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016007" id="016007" >7</span>
 No bread shall be broken for mourners, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To comfort them for the dead; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shall cup of consolation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be given for father or mother. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016008" id="016008" >8</span>
 Do not enter the house of feasting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sit with them, eating and drinking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016009" id="016009" >9</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark this – ye shall live to see it– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This place I will bring to silence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice of mirth and gladness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice of bridegroom and bride. </p><h6>The Infidelity which Justifies the Doom</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024016010" id="016010" >10</span>
 After thou hast delivered this message to the people,  they will ask thee why Jehovah has doomed them to all  this misery. "What is our guilt," they will say, "and  what is the sin we have committed against Jehovah our 
<span class="verse" rel="v024016011" id="016011" >11</span>
 God?" Tell them then, "Jehovah doth solemnly  declare: it is because your fathers abandoned Me  for the worship and the service of other gods; yes, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024016012" id="016012" >12</span>
 they abandoned Me and neglected My law. And  your own behaviour has been worse than that of your  fathers. See how every man of you is following the  impulses of his own wicked and stubborn heart and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024016013" id="016013" >13</span>
 refusing to listen to Me. For this, then, I will hurl you  out of this land into a land that is strange to you and  your fathers; and there, day and night, ye shall serve  other gods; for no favour shall ye have from Me." </p><h6>The Doom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016016" id="016016" >16</span>
 Behold, I will send many fishers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And them they shall fish, saith Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And then will I send many hunters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall hunt them down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From every mountain and hill <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And out of the clefts of the rocks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016017" id="016017" >17</span>
 For Mine eyes are all their ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From My face they are not concealed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their guilt is not hid from Mine eyes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016018" id="016018" >18</span>
 I will therefore requite them double <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all their guilt and sin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In profaning My land with the carcases <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their detestable idols, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And filling Mine inheritance <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their abominations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016021" id="016021" >21</span>
 See then! I wil give them to feel– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This once I will give them to feel– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight of My mighty hand: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then shall they know that My name is Jehovah. </p><h6>Ultimate Recognition by the Heathen of Jehovah as the True God</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My refuge in time of trouble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To Thee from the ends of the earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall nations come and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only lies have our fathers inherited, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty and useless (idols)." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024016020" id="016020" >20</span>
 Shall a man make gods for himself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which yet are no gods at all? </p><h6>The Doom</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="017001">17</span> The sin of Judah is written <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With pencil of iron; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With diamond point it is graven <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tablet of their heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On the horns of their altars, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024017002" id="017002" >2</span>
 On every green tree, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On every high hill, <br /><br />

 On the heights in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy substance and all thy treasures <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As spoil I will give, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In requital for all the sins <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That pervaded thy borders. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024017004" id="017004" >4</span>
 And then thou shalt slack thy hold <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the land that I gave thee: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make thee the slave of thy foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a land that is strange to thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a fire in Mine anger is kindled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That burneth for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Accursed the man that trusteth in man, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And maketh flesh his arm, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While his heart is estranged from Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 Like a bare desert shrub shall he be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No destiny fair shall be his; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His home is the scorching wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A salt uninhabited land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024017007" id="017007" >7</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v024017008" id="017008" >8</span>
 Like a tree shall he be, by the waters planted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That stretcheth its roots out towards the stream, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And is never afraid for the coming of heat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But its leaves are for ever green– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year of drought untroubled– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it yeildeth fruit without ceasing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024017011" id="017011" >11</span>
 Like a patridge that sitteth on eggs <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it hath not laid, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the man that getteth him riches <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ways unjust. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of his days he must leave them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His end shall declare him a fool. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 O Jehovah, Thou Hope of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put to shame shall all be that forsake Thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, they that prove faithless to Thee <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the land shall be put to confussion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they have forsaken <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fountain of Living Water. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v024017019" id="017019" >19</span>
 Jehovah commanded me to go and take my stand at  the Benjamin gate, through which the kings of Judah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017020" id="017020" >20</span>
 go in and out, and at all the gates of Jerusalem, and  there He charged me to address them as follows: "Ye  kings of Judah, and all ye citizens of Judah and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017021" id="017021" >21</span>
 Jerusalem that pass through these gates, Thus saith  Jehovah: As ye value you lives, be very careful not  to carry a burden or to bring anything of the kind  through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017022" id="017022" >22</span>
 also to carry no load out of your houses on the  Sabbath day, and to do no work of any kind, but to keep  the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017023" id="017023" >23</span>
 But instead of obediently inclining their ear, they  stiffened their neck; they would have nothing to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017024" id="017024" >24</span>
 do with obedience or discipline. If you, however,  will give earnest heed to Me, saith Jehovah, and  refrain from bringing loads through the city gates on the  Sabbath day, if you keep the Sabbath day holy and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017025" id="017025" >25</span>
 abstain from work of every kind, then kings that  sit upon the throne of David shall enter the gates of  this city riding on chariots and horses, accompanied  by their princes, the men of Judah, and the citizens of  Jerusalem; and the city shall be inhabited for ever. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017026" id="017026" >26</span>
 From the cities of Judah, the neighbourhood of  Jerusalem, and the district of Benjamin, from the low-  land, the hill country, and the south, men shall come  to the Temple with burnt-offerings and sacrifices, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024017027" id="017027" >27</span>
 oblations and frankincense, and praise-offerings. If,  however, you refuse to give heed to Me and to keep the  Sabbath day holy by refraining from carrying burdens  through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,  then I will kindle in her gates a fire unquenchable, that  shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span> Jeremiah received from Jehovah the message which

<span class="verse" rel="v024018003" id="018003" >3</span>
 municate to thee there." So I went down to the  potter’s house: and there he was-engaged on a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018004" id="018004" >4</span>
 piece of work at the wheel. Now, if the thing he was  making was spoiled in his hands, he would just shape  the material over again into another such vessel as he  had decided to make. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024018005" id="018005" >5</span>
 Thereupon there flashed upon me this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018006" id="018006" >6</span>
 Jehovah. "Cannot I," He said, "deal with you,  O household of Israel, like this potter? You are  in My hand just like the clay in the potter’s hand.

 At one moment I may decide to pluck up or break 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018008" id="018008" >8</span>
 down and destroy some nation of kingdom; but  if the nation whose fate I have decreed turn from its  wickedness, then I relent and do not execute the doom 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 I had planned for it. At another moment I may  decide to build up or to plant some nation of kingdom; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 but if its behaviour displeases Me, if it refuses to listen  to My voice, then I will retract the favours I had  intended to confer upon it. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024018011" id="018011" >11</span>
 Now, therefore, make this announcement to the men  of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, Thus saith  Jehovah: Beware! I am shaping calamity for you, I  am fashioning plans for your discomfiture. Turn, then,  every man of you, from your evil ways, and amend your 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018012" id="018012" >12</span>
 life and behaviour." But they will say, "No, there  is no hope of that: rather will we follow devices of our  own and yeild, every man of us, to the impulses of our  wicked and stubborn hearts." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024018013" id="018013" >13</span>
 Thus therefore saith Jehovah: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask any heathen man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he ever heard aught like this? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; An utterly horrible thing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath been wrought by the Virgin of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 Doth the white snow vanish from Sirion’s crags? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the rills that flow cold from the hills ever dry? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018015" id="018015" >15</span>
 Yet Me hath My people forgotten; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods that they worship are phantoms. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have stumbled upon the way <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordained for them of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And turned into bypaths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That never were truly laid. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018016" id="018016" >16</span>
 So their land shall be made a horror– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An everlasting scorn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall fill every traveller with horror– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereat he will shake his head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018017" id="018017" >17</span>
 I will scatter them like the sirocco <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the face of their foes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not My face, but My back, will I show them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the day of their calamity. </p><h6>The Plots</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018018" id="018018" >18</span>
 Then said they, "Come, let us forge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plot against Jeremiah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the priests will not lack for instruction to offer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the wise men for counsel to render, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the prophet for words to declare. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, with the tongue let us smite him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us watch him in all that he says." </p><h6>Jeremiah’s Prayer</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018019" id="018019" >19</span>
 O Jehovah, give heed unto me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hearken to my contention. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018020" id="018020" >20</span>
 Shall evil be rendered for good <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a pit they have dug for my life? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Call to mind how I stood before Thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To utter a prayer for their welfare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to turn Thy fury from them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018021" id="018021" >21</span>
 Abandon Thou therefore their children to famine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver them up to the sword; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let their wives become childless widows, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let their men be slain of death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their youths may the sword smite in battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018022" id="018022" >22</span>
 Let a cry ring out from their houses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When swiftly Thou bringest the raiders upon them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a pit they have dug to take me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And snares they have hid for my feet. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024018023" id="018023" >23</span>
 For well, O Jehovah, Thou knowest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How they plotted against me to slay me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O pardon not their guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And blot not their sin from Thy sight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them prostrate be hurled before Thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deal Thou with them in the time of Thine anger. </p><h6>The Breaking of the Flask Symbolical of the Shattering of the Nation</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="019001">19</span> Then Jehovah commanded me to go and buy a  potter’s earthenware flask, and, accompanied by a few 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019002" id="019002" >2</span>
 elders of the people and a few priests, to proceed  to the Valley of the son of Hinnom by the entry of the  Potsherd gate, and there announce the message with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 which He would charge me. And the message was  this: "Listen, ye kings of Judah, and ye citizens of  Jerusalem, to what Jehovah is about to say: Thus  saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Mark  this well. I will soon bring such a catastrophe upon  this place as will make the ears of all who hear of it 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019004" id="019004" >4</span>
 tingle; because they have forsaken Me and de-  nationalised this place by their burnt-offerings to other  gods, strange alike to them and their forefathers;  and the kings of Judah have filled this place with the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019005" id="019005" >5</span>
 blood of innocent men. They have built Baal  sanctuaries to burn their sons in the fire as offerings to  Baal, though this was no commandment of Mine – such 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019006" id="019006" >6</span>
 a thing never entered into My mind. Mark this,  therefore: days are coming, saith Jehovah, when this  place shall be no more called Topheth, nor the Valley  of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019007" id="019007" >7</span>
 and I will spill upon the ground the wisdom of Judah  and Jerusalem in this place. I will lay them low by  the sword of their enemies and by the hands of those  that seek their life: their dead bodies I will give to the  birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019008" id="019008" >8</span>
 And I will make this city a horror and a scorn; all  that pass by her shall be filled with horror and with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019009" id="019009" >9</span>
 scorn at all the blows that I shall rain upon her. I  will drive them to eat the flesh of their sons and  daughters: in the stress of the siege to which they shall  be reduced by their enemies and by those that seek  their life, they will devour one another. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 Then thou shalt break the flask in the presence of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019011" id="019011" >11</span>
 the men that accompany thee, and thou shalt say to  them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: This is how I will  shatter this people and this city, just as a potter’s  jar is shattered beyond all possibility of repair; and  Topheth shall be used as a burying-place for want of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019012" id="019012" >12</span>
 room (elsewhere). This is how I will deal, saith  Jehovah, with this place and its inhabitants – I will 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019013" id="019013" >13</span>
 make this city like Topheth; and the houses of  Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah shall be, like the  place of Topheth, defiled – all the houses, that is,  from whose roofs the smoke of sacrifice has ascended  to the host of heaven, and drink-offerings have been  poured out to other gods. </p><h6>Jeremiah Put in the Stocks for his Preaching</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024019014" id="019014" >14</span>
 Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth to which  Jehovah had sent him on his prophetic errand; and,  taking his stand in the Temple court he thus addressed 
<span class="verse" rel="v024019015" id="019015" >15</span>
 the assembled people: "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel, Mark this well; soon I will bring  upon this city and upon all her villages the full measure  of disaster with which I have threatened her, because  they have stiffened their necks and refused to listen  to My words." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span> Now when Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest,  who had the general supervision of the Temple, heard 
<span class="verse" rel="v024020002" id="020002" >2</span>
 this prophetic utterance of Jeremiah’s, he beat him  and put him in the stocks that were at the upper 
<span class="verse" rel="v024020003" id="020003" >3</span>
 Benjamin gate in the Temple. Next day, after  Pashhur had released Jeremiah from the stocks,  Jeremiah said to him, "Thy name is (henceforth) 
<span class="verse" rel="v024020004" id="020004" >4</span>
 changed from Pashhur to Terror. For thus saith  Jehovah: See! I will make thee a terror to thyself  and to all thy friends. They shall fall by the enemy’s  sword, and thou shalt see it with thine own eyes. I  will give the whole of Judah into the hands of the  king of Babylon, and he shall carry them to exile in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 Babylon and slay them with the sword. And all the  resources of this city, all her wealth, all that she prizes,  all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will deliver  into the hands of their enemies, who shall despoil them 
<span class="verse" rel="v024020006" id="020006" >6</span>
 and carry them off to Babylon. As for thee, Pashhur,  thou and all who share thy home shall be swept into  captivity. To Babylon thou shalt come; there  thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried – thou  and all the friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies." </p><h6>What it Cost</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020007" id="020007" >7</span>
 O Jehovah, Thou hast beguiled me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I let myself be beguiled; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Too strong for me art Thou, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thou hast won the victory. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All the day long am I ridiculed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one mocketh at me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020008" id="020008" >8</span>
 Every word that I utter is laughed at; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wronged" and "despoiled" must I cry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For to me is the word of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An endless reproach and derision. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020009" id="020009" >9</span>
 When I vow to put it out my mind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to speak in His name no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It doth burn in my heart like a fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut up within my bones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I am weary of enduring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I can bear it no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020010" id="020010" >10</span>
 For I hear their many whispers– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terror on every side– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Denounce him." "Yes, we will denounce him." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All ye his familiar friends, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a narrow watch for his stumbling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance he will be beguiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And we shall prevail against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take our vengeance upon him." </p><h6>The Prophet’s Sense of Divine Support</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020011" id="020011" >11</span>
 But Jehovah Himself is with me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a mighty One and a terrible; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So my persecutors shall stumble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall not prevail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But because they have dealt unwisely, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall come to utter shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To perpetual confusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which never shall be forgotten. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020012" id="020012" >12</span>
 O Jehovah that triest the righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That mind and heart dost behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me see Thy vengeance upon them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For on Thee have I rolled my cause. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020013" id="020013" >13</span>
 Sing to Jehovah, sing praise to Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For He hath delivered the soul of the needy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the hand of evil-doers. </p><h6>The Prophet’s Despair</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020014" id="020014" >14</span>
 A curse on the day whereon I was born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unblest be the day that my mother bore me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020015" id="020015" >15</span>
 A curse on the man who announced to my father <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A man child is born to thee" – making him glad. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020016" id="020016" >16</span>
 Let the fate of that man be the fate of the cities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O’erthrown by Jehovah in pitiless anger; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him hear in the morning a cry (of distress) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at noon the alarum of war: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024020017" id="020017" >17</span>
 That he slew me not in the womb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my mother had been my grave, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And her womb had been great for ever. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024020018" id="020018" >18</span>
 O why came I forth from the womb <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To behold but labour and sorrow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That my days should be wasted with shame? <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,  when King Zedekiah sent the following request to him  through Pashhur, the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021002" id="021002" >2</span>
 the son of Maaseiah the priest. "Be good enough," they  said, "to enquire of Jehovah on our behalf: for  Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon is fighting against  us. Perhaps Jehovah will so deal with us in His own  wonderful way that the siege will be raised." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024021003" id="021003" >3</span>
 To the deputation Jeremiah replied: "Take this 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 answer back to Zedekiah. Thus saith Jehovah, the  God of Israel: Now you are able to fight outside the  wall with the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who  are besieging you; but soon I will drive you with the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021005" id="021005" >5</span>
 weapons you handle inside this city. And I myself  will fight against you with outstretched hand and  mighty arm – in anger, in fury, and in towering wrath. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021006" id="021006" >6</span>
 Yes, I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021007" id="021007" >7</span>
 and beast, with a great and deadly pestilence. There-  after, saith Jehovah, Zedekiah, king of Judah and his  ministers and the people in this city that survive the  pestilence, sword and famine, I will deliver into the  hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into  the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of those  that seek their life; and they shall smite them with  the edge of the sword without mercy, compassion, or  pity. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024021008" id="021008" >8</span>
 To the people thy message shall be this. Thus saith  Jehovah: See! I set before you the way of life and the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 way of death. Whoever remains in this city shall die  by sword, famine, or pestilence; but whoever goes out  and surrenders to the Chaldeans that besiege you shall  be spared, though he shall escape with nothing but 
<span class="verse" rel="v024021010" id="021010" >10</span>
 his life. For, saith Jehovah, I have set My face against  this city for evil and not for good; into the hands of the  king of Babylon it shall be given, and he shall burn it  with fire. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 To the royal house of Judah thy message shall be  this.  Hear ye the word of Jehovah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024021012" id="021012" >12</span>
 O household of David, thus saith Jehovah:  In the morning give righteous judgment, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver the man that is plundered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the clutch of his oppressor: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest My fury break forth like fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And blaze unquenchably, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of your evil doings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024021013" id="021013" >13</span>
 Behold, I am against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou denizen of the vale <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye who say, ’Who can come down against us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And find his way into our lairs?’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024021014" id="021014" >14</span>
 I will punish you, saith Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruit of your deeds ye shall reap: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will kindle a fire in her forest <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which round and round will devour." </p><h6>Solemn Warning</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="022001">22</span> Jehovah commanded me to go down to the palace  of the king of Judah and there deliver the following 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022002" id="022002" >2</span>
 message: O king of Judah that sittest on the throne of  David, listen to the word of Jehovah – thou and thy  ministers and thy people who enter these gates. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022003" id="022003" >3</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: Conduct your administration on  principles of justice and right, deliver the victims  of exploitation from the clutch of the oppressor, refrain  from all wrong and violence to the resident alien, the  fatherless and the widow, and shed no innocent blood 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022004" id="022004" >4</span>
 in this place. If you carry out this policy faithfully,  then kings upon the throne of David shall pass through t  the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022005" id="022005" >5</span>
 –they, their ministers and their people. But if you  ignore this message (of Mine), then, saith Jehovah, I  solemnly swear that this house shall be laid in ruins. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022006" id="022006" >6</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah concerning the palace of the  king of Judah:  Though thou art to Me as Gilead, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the (thick-wooded) summit of Lebanon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will turn thee into a desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unihabited city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022007" id="022007" >7</span>
 I will dedicate men to destroy thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one with his weapons; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall fell thy choicest cedars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurl them into the fire. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022008" id="022008" >8</span>
 The people of many nations, as they pass by this city,  shall ask one another why Jehovah has dealt thus with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022009" id="022009" >9</span>
 this great city, and they shall answer: It is because  they abandoned their convenant with Jehovah their  God and gave themselves up to the worship and service  of other gods. </p><h6>On Jehoahaz</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022010" id="022010" >10</span>
 Weep not for him that is dead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mourn not for him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But weep rather for him that is gone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he cometh no more: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the land of his birth he shall see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevermore. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022011" id="022011" >11</span>
 For this is the word of Jehovah concerning Shallum,  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, the successor of his  father Josiah, who went forth from this place: "He 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022012" id="022012" >12</span>
 shall never come back to it again; but in the land of  exile to which they have carried him he shall die, and  this land he shall see no more." </p><h6>On Jehoiakim</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022013" id="022013" >13</span>
 Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his chambers by injustice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That serveth himself of his neighbour for nothing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And giveth him not his wages– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022014" id="022014" >14</span>
 That saith, "I will build me a spacious house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And roomy chambers and windows broad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With panels of cedar, and painted vermilion," <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022015" id="022015" >15</span>
 Do great cedar palaces make thee a king? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not thy father eat and drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And enjoy his measure of good things? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet justice and right did he also dispense <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022016" id="022016" >16</span>
 And he cared for the cause of the poor and the needy. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not that true knowledge of Me, saith Jehovah? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022017" id="022017" >17</span>
 But thou hast neither eyes nor heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For aught save thine own mean profit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The shedding of innocent blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the practice of wrong and oppression. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022018" id="022018" >18</span>
 This, therefore, is the message of Jehovah to Jehoia- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; kim, the son Josiah, king of Judah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe unto this man Jehoiakim! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No one for him shall lament <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " O brother of mine," "O sister." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No one for him shall lament <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An lord!" "Alas for his glory." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022019" id="022019" >19</span>
 But burial like that of an ass shall be his– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dragged along and flung forth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the gates of Jerusalem. </p><h6>On Jehoiachin</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022020" id="022020" >20</span>
 Get thee up tp Lebanon and cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lift up thy voice in Bashan; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry from the hills of Abarim. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all that thou lovest is shattered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022021" id="022021" >21</span>
 In the days of good fortune I spoke to thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou didst refuse to listen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And such hath thy way been from youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my voice thou hast never hearkened. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022022" id="022022" >22</span>
 All thy shepherds like sheep by the wind shall be driven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And those whom thou lovest shall captive depart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame and confusion shall then be thy doom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In requital for all thy wickedness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022023" id="022023" >23</span>
 O thou that inhabitest Lebanon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nestled amongst the cedars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; How wilt thou groan when thy pangs come upon thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy pain as of woman in travail! <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022024" id="022024" >24</span>
 As truly as I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah,  the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet-  ring on thy right hand, yet I would tear him off <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024022025" id="022025" >25</span>
 Yea, I will delilver thee into the hands of those that  seek thy life, and into the hands of those thou dreadest,  into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022026" id="022026" >26</span>
 and into the hands of the Chaldeans. Yea, thee and  the mother that bore thee I will hurl into another land  than the land thou wast born in, and there thou shalt 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022027" id="022027" >27</span>
 die. Nevermore shall they return to the land to which  they long to return. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024022028" id="022028" >28</span>
 Hath this man Coniah become <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a figure one smasheth in scorn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a vessel that no man doth care for? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why hath he been cast forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurled to a land that was strange to him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022029" id="022029" >29</span>
 O land, land, land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear thou the word of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024022030" id="022030" >30</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Write this man down as childless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For none of his seed shall be honoured <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To sit on the throne of David <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or rule any more over Judah. </p><h6>Unfaithful Rulers to be Succeeded by those that are Faithful</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="023001">23</span> Woe to the shepherds that ruin and scatter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flock that was theirs to pasture. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023002" id="023002" >2</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the shepherds that tend my people: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye have scattered My flock and driven them away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye have not visited them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore will visit you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wickedness of your doings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023003" id="023003" >3</span>
 I will gather My flock that is left <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the countries to which I have driven them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will bring them back to their homesteads, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall be fruitful and multiply. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023004" id="023004" >4</span>
 I will raise up shepherds to tend to them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No fear or dismay or terror <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall they know any more, saith Jehovah. </p><h6>Promise of the Ideal King, or Messiah</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023005" id="023005" >5</span>
 Behold, saith Jehovah, in the days that are coming <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will raise up to David a righteous shoot, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall reign as King, and behave with wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And execute justice and right in the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023006" id="023006" >6</span>
 In his days shall Judah be crowned with salvation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Israel in safety shall dwell; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the name men shall call him– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Champion is Jehovah." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024023007" id="023007" >7</span>
 Therefore, behold, saith Jehovah, days are coming  when men shall no more say, "As surely as Jehovah  liveth who brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt," 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023008" id="023008" >8</span>
 but "As surely as Jehovah liveth who brought the race  of the household of Israel from the north country and  from all the countries to which He had driven them";  and they shall dwell in their own land. </p><h6>The Character and Fate of the False Prophets</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024023009" id="023009" >9</span>
 Concerning the prophets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart within me is broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My bones are all grown soft; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a drunken man am I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a man overcome of wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; By reason of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of His glorious majesty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023010" id="023010" >10</span>
 For the land is full of adulterers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who run an evil course, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whose might is not of right. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023011" id="023011" >11</span>
 For prophet and priest are profane: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wickedness I have witnessed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mine own very house, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023012" id="023012" >12</span>
 The way they must tread shall be therefore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As slippery ground in the darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereon they are thrust till they fall: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I will bring evil upon them– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The year of their visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023013" id="023013" >13</span>
 In samaria’s prophets I witnessed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaviour that was revolting; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They prophesied by the Baal <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seduced My people Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023014" id="023014" >14</span>
 But a horrible thing have I seen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prophets of Jerusalem– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Adultery, walking in falsehood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strengthening the hands of the wicked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That no man doth turn from his wickedness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They are all of them grown like Sodom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her citizens like Gomorrah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023015" id="023015" >15</span>
 Thus therefore concerning the prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declareth Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold! I will feed them with wormwood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gall will I give them to drink; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For from Jerusalem’s prophets there spreadeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impiety over the land. </p><h6>The Promises are False, because the Prophets are not Divinely Inspired</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023016" id="023016" >16</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearken not to the words of the prophets; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They fill you with hopes that are vain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis their own heart’s vision they utter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not what Jehovah hath spoken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023017" id="023017" >17</span>
 They assure thos who mock at the word of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That all with them shall be well. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They assure those who follow their own stubborn hearts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That no evil shall come upon them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023018" id="023018" >18</span>
 But which of them ever hath stood and looked on <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the council of Jehovah? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or which of them ever hath listened <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And heard any word of His? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023021" id="023021" >21</span>
 I sent not the prophets, and yet they ran; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding I spoke not to them, yet they prophesied. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023022" id="023022" >22</span>
 But if ever they truly had stood in My council <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And heard any word that was Mine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My people they would have turned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their evil ways and behaviour. </p><h6>Inescapable Doom of the False Prophets</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023023" id="023023" >23</span>
 Am I, saith Jehovah, a God that is nigh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not a God afar? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023024" id="023024" >24</span>
 Can any man hide, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret, where I cannot see him? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not I fill heaven and earth? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023025" id="023025" >25</span>
 I have heard what the prophets say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That prophesy lies in My name; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have dreamed, I have dreamed, I have dreamed." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023026" id="023026" >26</span>
 Will the heart of the prophets not turn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That prophesy lies, and that prophesy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought but their own heart’s delusions, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024023027" id="023027" >27</span>
 And think to drive My name <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean out of the minds of My people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the dreams that they tell one another, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As erst by the Baal My name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was driven from the mind of their fathers? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023028" id="023028" >28</span>
 The prophet that hath a dream– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him declare his dream: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that hath My word– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him faithfully utter My word. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What hath straw, saith Jehovah, to do with the wheat? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024023029" id="023029" >29</span>
 Is not My word like a fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a hammer that shatters the rocks? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024023030" id="023030" >30</span>
 Mark this, therefore, saith Jehovah, I am against  the prophets that steal My words from one another. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023031" id="023031" >31</span>
 I am against the prophets who take their tongues 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023032" id="023032" >32</span>
 and immediately reel off an oracle. I am against the  prophets that prophesy living dreams, seducing My  people by their lies and their windy boasts. They have  not been sent by Me, nor have they any commission  from Me, and to this people they bring no sort of gain  whatever. </p><h6>The "Burden" of the Lord No More</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024023033" id="023033" >33</span>
 When a layman or a prophet or a priest asketh thee  what is the burden of Jehovah, tell them, "You"  saith Jehovah, "are the burden, and I will cast you off. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023034" id="023034" >34</span>
 As for the prophet, the priest, or the layman, who  speaks any more of Jehovah’s ’burden,’, that man and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023035" id="023035" >35</span>
 his household I will visit with judgment. You must  say to one another, ’What is Jehovah’s answer?’ or 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023036" id="023036" >36</span>
 ’What is Jehovah’s message?’ But you are not to  make mention to the burden of Jehovah any more.  Every man’s own (uninspired) word shall be his  burden; for you have perverted the words of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023038" id="023038" >38</span>
 living God, Jehovah of Hosts, our God. If, however,  you persist in speaking of ’the burden of Jehovah,’  Jehovah pronounces this word of doom: Because you  persist in using this expression ’burden of Jehovah,’  despite My explicit command to you not to use it, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023039" id="023039" >39</span>
 I will lift you up and cast you out of My sight – you 
<span class="verse" rel="v024023040" id="023040" >40</span>
 and the city I gave to you and your fathers, and I  will lay upon you everlasting reproach and unending  disgrace which shall never be forgotten." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="024001">24</span> After Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,  with the princes, the craftsmen and the smiths, had been  carried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar, king of  Babylon, into exile in Babylon, Jehovah in a vision  showed me two baskets of figs set down in front of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024024002" id="024002" >2</span>
 Jehovah’s Temple. One basket contained excellent  figs, like the figs that are first ripe: the figs in the other  were very bad, so bad that they could not be eaten." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024024003" id="024003" >3</span>
 Then Jehovah said to me, "What seest thou, Jere-  miah?" And I answered, "Figs – the good figs very  good, and the bad very bad, so bad that they cannot be  eaten." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024024004" id="024004" >4</span>
 Thereupon this message came to me from Jehovah, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024024005" id="024005" >5</span>
 "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: As with these  good figs, so will I regard with favour the exiles of  Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land 
<span class="verse" rel="v024024006" id="024006" >6</span>
 of the Chaldeans. I will set Mine eyes upon them for  good, and bring them back to this land. I will not pull  them down, but I will build them; I will not pluck them  up, but I will plant them; and I will give them a heart  to understand me, that I am Jehovah. They shall be  My people and I will be their God, if they turn to Me  with all their heart. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024024008" id="024008" >8</span>
 As for the figs that were too bad to eat, Thus saith  Jehovah: They are symbolic of the fate of Zedekiah,  king of Judah, and his princes, and the survivors of  Jerusalem that are left in this land, and those whose 
<span class="verse" rel="v024024009" id="024009" >9</span>
 home is in the land of Egypt. For I will make them  an object of consternation among every kingdom in  the world, a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a  curse, in every place to which I shall drive them; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024024010" id="024010" >10</span>
 and I will send among them sword, famine and pesti-  lence, till they perish from the land that I gave to them  and their forefathers.  upon Judah, upon the Neighbouring Nations, and upon the World at Large </p><h6>Prophetic Warning Disregarded by the People</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="025001">25</span> The message which came to Jeremiah concerning all  the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025002" id="025002" >2</span>
 year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon – the mes-  sage he delivered to all the people of Judah and all  the citizens of Jerusalem: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024025003" id="025003" >3</span>
 For twenty-three years – from the thirteenth year  of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, up to this  day – the message of Jehovah has been coming to me,  and I have declared it to you early and late, but you 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025004" id="025004" >4</span>
 have not listened. And early and late Jehovah has  been sending to you all His servants the prophets,  through you have not listened nor inclined an attentive 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025005" id="025005" >5</span>
 ear. My message was this: "If you abandon, every  man of you, your wicked ways and your evil behaviour,  then you shall dwell for ever in the land which Jehovah,  gave in the ancient time to you and your forefathers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025006" id="025006" >6</span>
 But do not indulge in the worship or service of other  gods, and do not provoke Jehovah with the fabri-  cations of your own hands: this can only injure your- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025007" id="025007" >7</span>
 selves." But you have not listened to me. </p><h6>Judgment upon Judah and Her Neighbours</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024025008" id="025008" >8</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: Because 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025009" id="025009" >9</span>
 ye have not listened to My words, I will send and  fetch a clan from the north, and I will bring them  against this land and its inhabitants and against the  sorrounding nation. I will devote them to destruc-  tion so appalling that men shall hiss and revile them 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025010" id="025010" >10</span>
 for ever; and I will banish form them the voice of mirth  and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, the  sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025011" id="025011" >11</span>
 This whole land shall be a waste and a horror, and  these nations shall serve the king of Babylon for seventy  years. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024025012" id="025012" >12</span>
 When, however, seventy years are completed, I will punish  the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their  guilt, and also the land of the Chaldeans, which I will make 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025013" id="025013" >13</span>
 desolate for ever; and I will bring upon that land all the words  I have pronounced against it – everything prophesied by  Jeremiah against all the nations, that is recorded in this Book. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025014" id="025014" >14</span>
 They, yes they, shall be reduced to slavery at the hands of  many nations and of great kings, and I will give them the reward  that their acts and deeds deserve. </p><h6>The Cup of Jehovah’s Fury to be Drunk by all Nations</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024025015" id="025015" >15</span>
 For thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, to me,  "Take from My hand this wine-cup of wrath, and give  it to all the nations to whom I send thee to drink from; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025016" id="025016" >16</span>
 and let them drink and reel in madness because of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025017" id="025017" >17</span>
 sword that I will send among them." So I took the  cup from the hand of Jehovah, and I gave it to all the  nations to whom Jehovah had sent me, to drink from– 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025018" id="025018" >18</span>
 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with her kings and  princes, to be made a desolation, a horror, a scorn, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025019" id="025019" >19</span>
 and a curse; Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with his 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025020" id="025020" >20</span>
 ministers, his princes, and all his people, and all  the foreign folk; all the kings of the land of Uz, and  all the kings of the land of the Philistines – Ashkelon,

 Gaza, Ekron, and the survivors of Ashdod; Edom, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025022" id="025022" >22</span>
 Moab, and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and sidon;  and the kings of the coast-land across the sea;

 Dedan and Tema and Buz, and all those that have the

 corners of their hair clipped; all the kings of Northern  Arabia, and all the kings of the north, far and near,  one with another, and all the kingdoms on the face of  the earth; and after them shall the king of Sheshach  drink. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024025027" id="025027" >27</span>
 Thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: Drink yourselves drunk till ye fall in  your vomit, to rise no more, because of the sword that I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025028" id="025028" >28</span>
 shall send among you. If they refuse to take the cup from  thy hand to drink, then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith 
<span class="verse" rel="v024025029" id="025029" >29</span>
 Jehovah of Hosts: Drink it you shall; for, if the city  which is called by Mine own name is the first to feel the  weight of My displeasure, how can you expect to go  utterly unpunished? Nay, verily, ye shall not escape;  for I am summoning the sword upon all the inhabitants  of the earth, saith Jehovah of Hosts. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024025030" id="025030" >30</span>
 As for thee, let thy prophetic message to them be  this:  Jehovah will roar from on high, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will utter His voice from His holy abode; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Against His own fold He will mightily roar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will lift a "hurrah" like the men at the vintage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against those that dwell on the earth, every one. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025031" id="025031" >31</span>
 Then din shall reach to the end of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah doth hold a dispute with the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, He with all flesh will contend in judgment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And those that are base He will give to the sword. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025032" id="025032" >32</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See! misery spreadeth from nation to nation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From the uttermost corners of earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There stirreth a mighty tempest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025033" id="025033" >33</span>
 That day the slain of Jehovah shall lie <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From one end of the earth to the other, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmourned, ungathered, unburied, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As dung on the face of the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025034" id="025034" >34</span>
 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And roll you in ashes, ye lords of the flock; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the days are ripe for your slaughter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like lambs that are doomed shall ye fall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025035" id="025035" >35</span>
 No escape shall be left for the shepherds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No flight for the lords of the flock; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025036" id="025036" >36</span>
 O hark to the cry of the shepherds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The howl of the lords of the flock; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah destroyeth their pasture. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025037" id="025037" >37</span>
 The meadows, so peaceful, are hushed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the fierce hot wrath of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024025038" id="025038" >38</span>
 The lions have left their covert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the land is become a desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the cruel sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And because of His fierce hot anger. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="026001">26</span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of  Josiah, king of Judah, the message which follows came 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026002" id="026002" >2</span>
 (to Jeremiah) from Jehovah: Thus saith Jehovah,  Take thy stand in the Temple court, and declare with-  out reservation to all the people of Judah who are come  to worship in the Temple, the whole message that I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026003" id="026003" >3</span>
 have commissioned thee to declare. It may be that  they will listen and severally abandon their wicked  ways: if they do, I will relent and not bring upon them  the calamity I am planning as penalty for their evil 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026004" id="026004" >4</span>
 behaviour. This, then, is what thou art to say to  them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye refuse to obey Me–  to live in accordance with the law that I have set before 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026005" id="026005" >5</span>
 you, and to listen, as ye have never yet listened, to the  words of My servants the prophets, whom early and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026006" id="026006" >6</span>
 late I have been sending to you – then I will make this  Temple like Shiloh, and as for this city, I will turn it  into an object of execration to every nation in the world. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024026007" id="026007" >7</span>
 Now the audience that listened to this message of  Jeremiah’s in the Temple included not only the whole  body of the people, but the priests and the prophets 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026008" id="026008" >8</span>
 as well. So when he had concluded the message which  Jehovah had commissioned him to declare to the whole 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026009" id="026009" >9</span>
 people, the priests and the prophets seized him. "You  must die," they exclaimed; "for how dare you  deliver in the name of Jehovah such a message as this,  that this Temple will meet the fate of Shiloh, and that  this city shall become an inhabited desolation?"  At this juncture all the people began to crowd round  Jeremiah in the Temple. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024026010" id="026010" >10</span>
 Now echoes of this tumult having reached the ears  of the countries of Judah, they proceeded from the  palace up to the Temple; and after they had taken  their seats at the entrance to the new gate of the Temple, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026011" id="026011" >11</span>
 the priests and the prophets addressed themselves to  the countries and the whole body of the people. "This  man." they said, "is guilty of a capital offence; for  he has solemnly declared that this city is doomed– 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026012" id="026012" >12</span>
 you have heard him with your own ears. Then  Jeremiah in his turn addressed himself to the courtiers  and to the whole body of the people. "It is Jehovah  Himself," he said, "that has sent me to proclaim upon  this Temple and city the doom which you have just 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026013" id="026013" >13</span>
 heard. If, however, you amend your life and con-  duct, and listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, then  He will relent and cancel His threat of catastrophe. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026014" id="026014" >14</span>
 As for myself, I am in your hands: deal with me as 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026015" id="026015" >15</span>
 you think right and proper. But be very sure of this,  that, if you put me to death, you will only be bringing  innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and  upon her people; for it is the simple truth that Jehovah  has sent me to deliver this message in your hearing." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026016" id="026016" >16</span>
 Thereupon, the courtiers and all the people said to the  priests and the prophets, "This man is not guilty of  any capital offence; for his message to us has behind  it the authority of Jehovah our God." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024026017" id="026017" >17</span>
 Them some of the elders, rising to their feet, thus ad- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026018" id="026018" >18</span>
 dressed the people assembled: "In the days of Hezekiah,  king of Judah," they said, "Micah of Moresheth was  prophesying; and this is what he said to all the people  of Judah:  Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts:  Like a field shall Zion be ploughed, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jerusalem levelled to ruins; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Temple Mount shall become <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a thickly wooded height. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024026019" id="026019" >19</span>
 Did Hezekiah the king or the people of Judah dream  of putting him to death? Rather were they not so over-  come by godly fear that they sued for the favour of  Jehovah, with the result that He relented and cancelled  His threat of catastrophe? But look at us! Why, we are  on the verge of involving ourselves in a great calamity." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024026024" id="026024" >24</span>
 Jeremiah, however, had (also) the support of Ahikam,  the son of Shaphan, who saved him from being delivered  to the people for execution. </p><h6>The Fate of Urijah</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024026020" id="026020" >20</span>
 There was another case of a man who delivered  prophetic messages in the name of Jehovah – Uriah,  the son of Shemaiah, who belonged to Kiriath-jearim.  Quite in the manner of Jeremiah, he too had pronounced 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026021" id="026021" >21</span>
 the doom of this city and land. His message having  reached the ears of King Jehoiakim, with all the court  and the military officials, the king took steps to have  him put to death. Urijah, however, got wind of his  purpose, and in terror he took to flight, finally reaching 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026022" id="026022" >22</span>
 Egypt; but King Jehoiakim despatched commis-  sioners to Egypt – Elnathan the son of Achbor, and a few 
<span class="verse" rel="v024026023" id="026023" >23</span>
 others – who removed him from Egypt and brought  him back to the presence of King Jehoiakim, who  had him slain with the sword, and his dead body flung  into the public burying-ground. </p><h6>No Hope of Speedy Release from Babylon</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="027001">27</span> In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the son  of Josiah, king of Judah, Jeremiah received from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027002" id="027002" >2</span>
 Jehovah the message which follows. Thus spoke  Jehovah: Make thongs and bars and put them on 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027003" id="027003" >3</span>
 thy neck, and send a message to the kings of Edom,  Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon, through their am-  bassadors who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027004" id="027004" >4</span>
 king of Judah, and bid them say to their masters,  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027005" id="027005" >5</span>
 Convey this message to your masters. I have made  the earth, with man and beast on the face of it,  by My great power and outstretched arm, and I give it 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027006" id="027006" >6</span>
 to whomsoever I please. At the moment I have given  all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king  of Babylon, My servant; the beasts of the field also  have I given him to serve him. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024027007" id="027007" >7</span>
 All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson,  till the time of his own land shall come – then many nations  and great kings shall make him serve. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024027008" id="027008" >8</span>
 The nation and the kingdom which refuses to serve  Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and to put their  necks to the yoke of the king of Babylon – that nation,  saith Jehovah, I will punish with sword, famine and  pestilence, till I have delivered them into his hands. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024027009" id="027009" >9</span>
 As for yourselves, do not listen to your prophets,  diviners, dreamers, soothsayers, or sorcerers, who  assure you that you will not be subject to the king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027010" id="027010" >10</span>
 Babylon. It is a lie that they preach to you, and it  will end in your removal from your own land; for I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027011" id="027011" >11</span>
 will indeed drive you away and ye shall perish. But  the nation that brings its neck to the yoke of the king of  Babylon and serves him, I will leave on their own soil,  which they shall continue to till and occupy." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024027012" id="027012" >12</span>
 A similar message I gave to zedekiah, king of Judah,  "If,’ said I, "you bring your neck to the yoke of the  king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, you will 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027013" id="027013" >13</span>
 be spared. Why should you and your people die by the  sword, famine and pestilence, with which Jehovah has  threatened the nation that refuses to serve the king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027014" id="027014" >14</span>
 Babylon? Do not listen to the prophets when they tell  you that you will not be subject to the king of Babylon: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027015" id="027015" >15</span>
 they are preaching to you a lie. I have not sent them,  saith Jehovah: it is a lie that they are preaching to you  in My name, and it can only end in your being driven  out and perishing – you and the prophets that preach  to you." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024027016" id="027016" >16</span>
 And the message that I gave to the priests and to all  this people was this: "Thus saith Jehovah: Do not  listen to the prophets when they tell you that the vessels  of the Temple will soon be brought back from Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027017" id="027017" >17</span>
 They are preaching to you a lie: do not listen to them.  Serve the king of Babylon and you will be spared: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027018" id="027018" >18</span>
 why should this city become a ruin? But if they are  real prophets with a real message from Jehovah, let  them entreat Jehovah of Hosts not to allow the vessels  that are left in the Temple and in the royal palace at 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027019" id="027019" >19</span>
 Jerusalem, to be taken to Babylon. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars and the sea  and the stands and the rest of the vessels that are left 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027020" id="027020" >20</span>
 in this city, which were not taken by Nebuchadnezzar,  king of Babylon, when he carried Jeconiah, the son of  Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the nobles of Judah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027021" id="027021" >21</span>
 and Jerusalem, from Jerusalem to Babylon. Yes,  thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, con-  cerning the vessels that are left in the Temple and in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024027022" id="027022" >22</span>
 the royal palace and at Jerusalem; To Babylon  they shall be brought, and there they shall remain till  the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then I will  bring them up and restore them to this place." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="028001">28</span> The same year, at the beginning of the reign of  Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth  year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who  belonged to Gibeon, addressed me as follows in the  Temple in the presence of the priests and of all the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028002" id="028002" >2</span>
 people. "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of  Israel: ’I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028003" id="028003" >3</span>
 Within two years’ time I will bring back to this place all  the Temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, king of  Babylon took from this place and carried to Babylon; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028004" id="028004" >4</span>
 and Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and  all the exiles of Judah that have gone to Babylon, I  will bring back to this place, saith Jehovah; for I will  break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’" <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024028005" id="028005" >5</span>
 Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to Hananiah the  prophet in the presence of the priests and of all the  people that were standing in the Temple; and Jeremiah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028006" id="028006" >6</span>
 the prophet said, "Amen! Jehovah do so! May  Johevah fulfil your prophecy and bring back the Temple  vessels and all the exiles from Babylon to this place! 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028007" id="028007" >7</span>
 I ask you, however to listen to this word that I am  about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028008" id="028008" >8</span>
 the people. From the beginning the prophets who pre-  ceded you and me in their messages concerning many 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028009" id="028009" >9</span>
 lands and mighty kingdoms, prophesied war. If a  prophet prophesies peace, it is only when his word has  been fulfilled that you can be sure that he has had a real 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028010" id="028010" >10</span>
 commission from Jehovah." Then Hananiah took the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028011" id="028011" >11</span>
 bar off Jeremiah’s neck, broke it, and declared in the  presence of all the people, "Thus saith Jehovah:  ’Within two years’ time, I will similarly break the  yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, off the  necks of all the nations.’" Then Jeremiah the prophet  went away. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024028012" id="028012" >12</span>
 But after Hananiah had broken the bar off Jeremiah’s  neck, there came to Jeremiah this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028013" id="028013" >13</span>
 Jehovah: "Go and say to Hananiah, Thus saith  Jehovah, The wooden bar you have indeed broken,but 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028014" id="028014" >14</span>
 I will replace it with a bar of iron. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The yoke that I  will put on the necks of all these nations will be made  of iron – a yoke of service to Nebuchadnezzar, king of  Babylon: for serve him they shall. I have also given 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028015" id="028015" >15</span>
 him the beasts of the field." Then Jeremiah said to  Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah. You have no com- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028016" id="028016" >16</span>
 mission from Jehovah: you are making this people  trust a lie. Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ’Mark this  well: I will dismiss thee from the face of the earth.  This very year thou shalt die; for thy words are a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024028017" id="028017" >17</span>
 disloyalty to Jehovah.’" And that very year, in the  seventh month, the prophet Hananaiah died. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="029001">29</span> The following is a copy of the letter sent from  Jerusalem by Jeremiah the prophet to the elders, the  priests, the prophets, and all the people, who had been  carried from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to exile in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029002" id="029002" >2</span>
 Babylon – after the surrender of Jeconiah the king,  and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes  of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and smiths– 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029003" id="029003" >3</span>
 the letter being sent by the hands of Eleasah the son of  Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, who had  been despatched to Babylon to Nebuchanezzar, king of  Babylon, by Zedekiah, king of Judah: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024029004" id="029004" >4</span>
 "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, to  all the exiles whom I have carried from Jerusalem to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029005" id="029005" >5</span>
 Babylon: Build houses and settle; plant gardens  and eat the fruit of them; take wives and rear families; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029006" id="029006" >6</span>
 take wives also for your sons and give your daughters  to husbands, that they may have sons and daughters;  increase your numbers and do not let them diminish. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029007" id="029007" >7</span>
 And strive for the welfare of the country to which I  have brought you as exiles. Pray for it to Jehovah;  for your own welfare and hers are bound up together. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029008" id="029008" >8</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Do not let yourselves be beguiled by the prophets and  diviners in your midst, and do not listen to the dreams 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029009" id="029009" >9</span>
 they dream; for it is a lie that they preach to you in  My name – they have no commission from Me, saith  Jehovah. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024029010" id="029010" >10</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah: As soon as Babylon’s  seventy years are accomplished, I will visit you and  bring you back to this place, in fulfilment of the garcious 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029011" id="029011" >11</span>
 promise I made you. For I know the thoughts I cherish  towards you – thoughts of weal and not of woe – to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029012" id="029012" >12</span>
 bestow upon you a future and a hope. When you  call, I will answer you, and I will listen to your 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029013" id="029013" >13</span>
 prayer. If ye seek Me ye shall find Me. If ye seek 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029014" id="029014" >14</span>
 Me with all your heart, I will reveal Myself to you,  saith Jehovah; and I will restore your fortunes and gather you  from all the nations and places to which I have driven you,  saith Jehovah, and I will bring you back to the place from  which I carried you into exile. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024029016" id="029016" >16</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah concerning the king who sits on  the throne of David, and concerning all the people whose home  is in this city – those brethren of yours who have not had to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029017" id="029017" >17</span>
 accompany you into exile. Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: See! I  will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence among them,  and I will make them like figs that are too horribly bad to eat. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029018" id="029018" >18</span>
 I will hunt them with sword, famine, and pestilence and I will  make them an object of consternation to every kingdom in the  world, and object of execration and horror, of scorn and insult 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029019" id="029019" >19</span>
 among all the nations to which I have driven them; because,  saith Jehovah, they refused to listen to the messages I sent them  early and late through My servants the prophets – yes, they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029020" id="029020" >20</span>
 refused to listen, saith Jehovah. See, then, that ye listen to  Jehovah’s message, all of you exiles whom I have sent from  Jerusalem to Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029015" id="029015" >15</span>
 But Jehovah, you say, has raised up for you prophets 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029021" id="029021" >21</span>
 in Babylon. Well, thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the  God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and  Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who preach to you a lie  in My name. Mark this: I will deliver them into the  hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and he 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029022" id="029022" >22</span>
 will slay them before your eyes; and their fate shall be  adopted by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon as a  model for imprecation. "Jehovah make thee," they  will say, "like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029023" id="029023" >23</span>
 Babylon roasted in the fire," because they wrought  impious folly in Israel, in committing adultery with  their neighbours’ wives and delivering in My name  lying messages which I never gave them. Well I  know it, saith Jehovah, and I am witness." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024029024" id="029024" >24</span>
 Touching the message of Jehovah of Hosts, the  God of Israel, to be delivered by Jeremiah concerning 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029025" id="029025" >25</span>
 Shemaiah of Nehelam. This is the man who sent a  letter in his own name to Zephaniah, the son of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029026" id="029026" >26</span>
 Maaseiah the priest. "Jehovah," he wrote, "has  made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,  to exercise an oversight in the Temple over all that play  the mad prophet and the ecstatic, and to put all such 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029027" id="029027" >27</span>
 in the stocks and in the iron collar. Why then did you  not rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth, who has been playing 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029028" id="029028" >28</span>
 the mad prophet among you? For he has sent a  message to us in Babylon, maintaining that the exile  would be long, and urging us to build houses and settle,  and to plant gardens and eat the fruit of them." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029029" id="029029" >29</span>
 Now Zephaniah the priest read the letter in the hearing  of Jeremiah the prophet. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024029030" id="029030" >30</span>
 Then there came to Jeremiah this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029031" id="029031" >31</span>
 Jehovah: Send to all the exiles and say, Thus saith  Jehovah concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Shemaiah  has been prophesying to you without any commission 
<span class="verse" rel="v024029032" id="029032" >32</span>
 from Me and has made you trust in a lie. For this  reason, therefore– thus saith Jehovah – I will punish  Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants: not a  man shall he have among you who will ever see the good  fortune I will bring you, saith Jehovah: for his words  are a disloyalty to Jehovah. </p><h6>The Glorious Future</h6><p></p><h6>Promise of Deliverance in the Day of Distress</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="030001">30</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024030002" id="030002" >2</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Write all the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024030003" id="030003" >3</span>
 words I have spoken to thee in a book. For mark!  the days are coming, saith Jehovah, when I will restore  the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah, and re-  establish them in possession of the land I gave their  forefathers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024030004" id="030004" >4</span>
 Now these are the words Jehovah hath spoken 
<span class="verse" rel="v024030005" id="030005" >5</span>
 concerning Israel and Judah. Yea, thus saith Jehovah: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard a cry of terror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of horror and dispeace. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030006" id="030006" >6</span>
 Ask ye now and see <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a man doth travail with child. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What meaneth them this sight– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every man with his hands on his loins? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And what mean all these faces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned to a deathly pallor? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030007" id="030007" >7</span>
 Alas! for great is this day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No day is like unto it; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A time of distress for Jacob– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet out of it he shall be saved. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030008" id="030008" >8</span>
 On that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will break the yoke from their necks; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will snap their bonds asunder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And strangers no more shall they serve. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030009" id="030009" >9</span>
 But Jehovah their God they shall serve. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And David also, their king, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom I will raise up unto them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030010" id="030010" >10</span>
 So fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Israel, be not dismayed, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For see! I will save both thee and thine offspring <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the far distant land where captive ye lie. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob once more shall have quite and ease <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own land, with no one make him afraid; <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024030011" id="030011" >11</span>
 For I, saith Jehovah, am with thee to save thee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; An end I will make of the nations– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each, among whom I have scattered thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But of thee I will not make an end. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not leave thee wholly unpunished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in measure I will chastise thee. </p><h6>Promise of Healing</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030012" id="030012" >12</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art wounded past all healing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And smitten very sore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030013" id="030013" >13</span>
 There is no one to plead thy cause; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No healing for thy wound, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy scars remain unclosed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030014" id="030014" >14</span>
 Thy lovers have all forgotten thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They care for thee no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I have struck thee as foemen strike, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With chastisement unpitying, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of thy manifold guilt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy sins` that are grown so mighty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030015" id="030015" >15</span>
 Why criest thou over thy wound, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thy pain is past all healing? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis because of thy manifold guilt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy sins that are grown so mighty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done these things unto thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030016" id="030016" >16</span>
 Devoured shall be therefore all those that devour thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine enemies all shall go into captivity; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that despoil thee themselves shall be spoiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy plunders I will consign to be plundered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030017" id="030017" >17</span>
 I will cause new flesh to grow over thy wound, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will heal thy scars, saith Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For men have called thee an outcast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our quarry" – for whom none careth. </p><h6>The Happy City, with her Native Prince</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030018" id="030018" >18</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The tents that were Jacob’s I yet will restore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the sites that were his I will show My compassion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On her own proper mound shall the city be built, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the place shall stand on its rightful site. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030019" id="030019" >19</span>
 And out of them songs of praise shall float, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voices of them that make merry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will add to their numbers till many they be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will crown them with glory, and they shall be honoured. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030020" id="030020" >20</span>
 Their children shall be as in days of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their sacred assembly safe under My care; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will punish all those that oppress them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030021" id="030021" >21</span>
 Their prince shall be one of themselves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their ruler shall come from among them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will let him draw nigh and approach Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For where is the man, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That else had the courage to face Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030022" id="030022" >22</span>
 And ye shall be My people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will be your God. </p><h6>Judgment shall Break upon the Wicked</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030023" id="030023" >23</span>
 Hark! ’tis Jehovah’s tempest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It goeth forth with fury– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A whirling temptest that whirleth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full straight for the heads of the wicked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024030024" id="030024" >24</span>
 The glowing wrath of Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not be backward turned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Until He have fully accomplished <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of His heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the days ye shall know what this meaneth. </p><h6>Israel’s Happy Return form Exile</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="031001">31</span> At that time, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be God indeed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto all the families of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall be My people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031002" id="031002" >2</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The people escaped from the sword <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall most surely find grace in the wilderness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When Israel seeketh for rest, <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024031003" id="031003" >3</span>
 From afar will Jehovah appear to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I have loved thee with love everlasting. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I with kindness have drawn thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031004" id="031004" >4</span>
 Once more, O virgin of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will build thee up securely: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more shalt thou deck thee with timbrels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And step in the merry dance; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031005" id="031005" >5</span>
 Once more on the hills of Samaria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall vineyards be planted by thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the planters shall eat what they planted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031006" id="031006" >6</span>
 For a day shall come when the watchers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ephraim’s highlands shall cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arise, let us pilgrim to Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where dwelleth Jehovah our God." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031007" id="031007" >7</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah to Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ring out a cry of joy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shout on the top of the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publish, and praise, and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jehovah hath saved His people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remnant of Israel." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031008" id="031008" >8</span>
 Behold, from the north land I bring them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And out of earth’s uttermost parts I will gather them– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them the blind and the lame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the women with child, with those soon to be mothers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hither again they shall come – a great company. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031009" id="031009" >9</span>
 Forth they went with tears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But their homeward way I will comfort; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will lead them to streams of water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a level way without stumbling; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am a Father to Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ephraim is My first-born. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031010" id="031010" >10</span>
 Hear, O ye nations, the word of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declare it to far distant islands and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "He that scattered Israel shall gather him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep him as shepherd his flock." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031011" id="031011" >11</span>
 For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And redeemed him from hands that were stronger than his. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031012" id="031012" >12</span>
 They shall come, they shall sing on the heights of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All radiant with joy at the gifts of Jehovah– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The corn and the wine and the oil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the young of the flock and the herd; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their soul like a well-watered garden shall be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall pine no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031013" id="031013" >13</span>
 Then the maids shall rejoice in the dance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the young and the old shall be merry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will turn their mourning to joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will comfort and gladden them after their sorrow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031014" id="031014" >14</span>
 The priests I will satisfy richly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My folk shall be filled with My bounty. </p><h6>Mother Rachel’s Sorrow for her Exiled Children</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031015" id="031015" >15</span>
 Hark! there echoes through Ramah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lament and bitter weeping: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis Rachel bewailing her children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And refusing to be comforted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they are no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031016" id="031016" >16</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Restrain thy voice from weeping, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep thine eyes from tears; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy work shall have its reward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the land of the foe shall thy children return. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031017" id="031017" >17</span>
 There is hope for thy coming days, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy children shall return. </p><h6>Israel’s Penitence, Return and Welcome Home</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031018" id="031018" >18</span>
 Truly I heard the voice <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ephraim thus lamenting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a calf unbroken was I. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring me back, and let me return, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Thou art Jehovah my God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031019" id="031019" >19</span>
 Mine exile hath led me to penitence; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chastened, I smote on my beasts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Put to shame and confusion am I, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I bear the reproach of my youth." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031020" id="031020" >20</span>
 Is not Ephraim my dear, dear son? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he not a darling child? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For let Me but utter his name, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And My mind keeps resting upon him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So My heart for him doth yearn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pity him I must. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031021" id="031021" >21</span>
 Set way-marks, and make thee guide-posts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethink thee of the highway,; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road by which thou didst travel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Return, O virgin of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return to these thy cities. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031022" id="031022" >22</span>
 How long, O backsliding daughter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilt thou remain irresolute? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For on earth hath Jehovah created a new thing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman shall into a man be transformed. </p><h6>The Restoration of Judah</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031023" id="031023" >23</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more shall this speech be used <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the land and the cities of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I have restored their fortunes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jehovah grant thee His blessing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sacred Mountain, where righteousness dwelleth." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031024" id="031024" >24</span>
 Yea, Judah shall dwell therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all her cities together– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The men that plough the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shepherds that wander with flocks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031025" id="031025" >25</span>
 For the weary soul I refresh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each soul that doth pine I replenish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031026" id="031026" >26</span>
 Thereupon I awoke and gazed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my sleep had been sweet unto me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031027" id="031027" >27</span>
 Behold, saith Jehovah, the days are coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I will sow the households of Israel and Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the seed of men and the seed of cattle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031028" id="031028" >28</span>
 And as once I was awakeful to pluck them up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To break down, to afflict, overthrow and destroy them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I will watch over them (once more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time) to build up and to plant, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031029" id="031029" >29</span>
 In those days men shall say no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the children’s teeth are on edge;" <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024031030" id="031030" >30</span>
 But each for his own sin shall die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the man that hath eaten sour grapes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall find his own teeth set on edge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031031" id="031031" >31</span>
 Behold the days are coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I, saith Jehovah, will make a new covenant <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the households of Israel and Judah– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031032" id="031032" >32</span>
 But unlike the covenant I made with their fathers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day, when I took their hand in Mine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring them out of the land of Egypt– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The covenant they themselves did break, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that I, on My part, was constrained to abhor them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031033" id="031033" >33</span>
 But this, saith Jehovah, is the covenant I will make <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the household of Israel after those days: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set My law in their bosom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And write it upon their heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will be their God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall be My people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031024" id="031024" >24</span>
 No more need any teach <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His fellow to know Jehovah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For one and all shall know Me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small and the great alike; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I will pardon their guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their sin will remember no more. </p><h6>Perpetuity of Israel</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031035" id="031035" >35</span>
 Thus declareth Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who giveth the sun for a light by day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon and the stars for a light by night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who stirreth the sea that the waves thereof roar– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah of Hosts is His name: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031036" id="031036" >36</span>
 Not until those fixed orbs shall vanish <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean out of My sight, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall Israel’s race cease to be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nation before Me for ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031037" id="031037" >37</span>
 Not till the heavens above can be measured, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And earth’s foundations be searched out beneath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I ever cast off the race of Israel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all they have done, saith Jehovah. </p><h6>Expansion of Jerusalem’s Ancient Boundary</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024031038" id="031038" >38</span>
 Be assured, saith Jehovah, the days are coming, when  the city shall again be built up for Jehovah from the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031039" id="031039" >39</span>
 tower of Hananel to the gate at the corner, and the  line of the wall shall pass straight on to the hill Gareb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024031040" id="031040" >40</span>
 where it will turn round to Goah. Further, the entire  valley (of Hinnom) with its corpses and ashes and  the whole locality as far as the valley of Kidron up  to the corner of the horse-gate on the east, shall be  consecrated to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up or  thrown down again for ever.  Restoration of his People by Redeeming a Piece of Land Belonging to his  Family at Anathoth </p><h6>The Purchase</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="032001">32</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah  in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032002" id="032002" >2</span>
 was in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At that  time the forces of the king of Babylon were investing  Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032003" id="032003" >3</span>
 the guard-house of the royal palace, where Zedekiah the  king had shut him up on account of his prophetic  preaching. "What do you mean," he had demanded,  "by an announcement of this kind: ’Thus saith  Jehovah, Depend upon it, I will give this city into the  hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032004" id="032004" >4</span>
 Nor shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape the hands of  the Chaldeans; he will assuredly be delivered into the  hands of the king of Babylon. He shall speak to him 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032005" id="032005" >5</span>
 face to face, and see him eye to eye; and he shall bring  Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain till I visit  him. Though you fight with the Chaldeans you shall  have no success.’" <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024032006" id="032006" >6</span>
 Now there came to Jeremiah the following message 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032007" id="032007" >7</span>
 from Jehovah: "Hanamel, the son of thine uncle  Shallum, is about to pay thee a visit, to request thee to  buy the land he holds at Anathoth; and he will urge  that, as thou art the next of kin, it is thy privilege and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032008" id="032008" >8</span>
 duty to receive it." And so it happened: my cousin  Hanamel paid me in the guard-house the visit Jehovah  had intimated, and said: "I want you to buy the land  I possess at Anathoth; for you are the legal heir, and  it is your duty to secure it – so buy it for yourself."  Then I recognised that the message I had received was 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032009" id="032009" >9</span>
 really from Jehovah. So I bought the land at Anathoth  from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the money 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032010" id="032010" >10</span>
 to him – seventeen silver shekels. Then I signed the  deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and paid him the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032011" id="032011" >11</span>
 money in full. I then took the purchase-deed–  the one which was sealed and the one which was open– 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032012" id="032012" >12</span>
 and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of  Machesiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, and  of the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deed 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032013" id="032013" >13</span>
 and of all the Jews in the guard-house. In their  presence I then gave these instructions to Baruch: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032014" id="032014" >14</span>
 "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Take these deeds – this purchase deed which is sealed  and this deed which is open – and put them in an  earthenware jar, so that they may be preserved for a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032015" id="032015" >15</span>
 long time to come. For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: A time is coming when houses and  fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land." </p><h6>The Prophet’s Prayer</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024032016" id="032016" >16</span>
 Now, after I had given the purchase-deed to Baruch,  the son of Neriah, I prayed in these words to Jehovah: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032017" id="032017" >17</span>
 "Ah, Lord Jehovah! Thou, by Thy mighty power and  outstretched arm, hast made the heavens and the earth, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032018" id="032018" >18</span>
 and nothing is too hard for Thee. Kindness Thou  showest to thousands, and retribution for the guilt of  the fathers thou bringest home to their children after 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032019" id="032019" >19</span>
 them, Thou great and mighty God, great in purpose and  mighty in action, whose eyes are open to all the ways of  men, giving to each his deserts and the fruit of his deeds. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032020" id="032020" >20</span>
 In the land of Egypt Thou didst set in Israel and  among (other) men signs and wonders (which are  commemorated) unto this day, and so didst win for 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032021" id="032021" >21</span>
 Thyself the renown that is Thine to-day; and Thou  didst bring Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt  by signs and wonders, with mighty hand out- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032022" id="032022" >22</span>
 stretched arm and terrors great; and Thou gavest them  this land which Thou didst swear to their fathers to  give them – a land flowing with milk and honey – and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032023" id="032023" >23</span>
 they came in and took possession of it. But they would  not listen to Thy voice, nor live in accordance with Thy  law; they have left undone all that Thou didst com-  mand them to do; and so Thou hast brought all this  misery upon them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024032024" id="032024" >24</span>
 Behold how the siege-mounds for storming the city  are already close upon it, and under the stress of  sword, famine and pestilence, the city is already as good  as given into the hands of the Chaldeans that are assail-  ing it. What Thou hast threatened has come, as 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032025" id="032025" >25</span>
 Thou Thyself seest. And it was Thou Thyself, O  Lord Jehovah, who didst command me to buy the land;  (and this I have done), writing and sealing the deed  and calling witnesses, though all the while the city is  already as good as delivered into the hands of the  Chaldeans." </p><h6>The Divine Answer: First, Judgment for Sin</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024032026" id="032026" >26</span>
 Then there came to Jeremiah the following message 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032027" id="032027" >27</span>
 from Jehovah: I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032028" id="032028" >28</span>
 there anything too hard for Me? Therefore thus saith  Jehovah: Behold! I am about to deliver this city into  the hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadrezzar, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032029" id="032029" >29</span>
 king of Babylon, and he shall take it. Yes, the  Chaldeans that are assailing this city shall come and set  this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose  roofs they have provoked Me by burning sacrifice to  the Baal and by offering drink-offerings to other 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032030" id="032030" >30</span>
 gods; for, ever since their youth the people of Israel  and Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032031" id="032031" >31</span>
 From the day it was built up to this day, this city has  provoked Me to remove it, in wrath and fury, out of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032032" id="032032" >32</span>
 My sight, for all the evil that the people of Israel and  Judah have wrought to vex Me – themselves, with their  kings, princes, priests and prophets, with the men of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032033" id="032033" >33</span>
 Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. They have  turned their backs to Me instead of their faces; and  though I taught them early and late, they would never 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032034" id="032034" >34</span>
 listen or accept correction. The very House that  bears My name they have defiled by introducing 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032035" id="032035" >35</span>
 into it their abominable worship. They have built  Baal sanctuaries in the Valley of the son of Hinnom  for the (fiery) consecration of their sons and daughters  to Molech, though this was no commandment of  Mine – it never entered into My mind that they should  do this abomination, and thus involve Judah in sin. </p><h6>Thereafter, Promise of Restoration</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024032036" id="032036" >36</span>
 Now, therefore, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel,  concerning the city of which ye say that hunger,  famine and pestilence have already as good as delivered 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032037" id="032037" >37</span>
 it into the hands of the king of Babylon: See! I will  gather them out of all the lands to which, in My great  wrath, anger, and fury, I have driven them, for I will  bring them back to this place and settle them here 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032038" id="032038" >38</span>
 securely; and they shall be My people, and I will be 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032039" id="032039" >39</span>
 their God. A single heart I will give them, and a single  way (will I set before them), that they may hold Me  in reverence for ever, and that they and their children 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032040" id="032040" >40</span>
 after them may prosper; and I will make with them  an everlasting covenant to follow them ceaselessly  with My blessing, and I will put the fear of Me in their  hearts, that they may follow Me without swerving. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032041" id="032041" >41</span>
 It will also be a joy to Me to do them good; and  faithfully, with all My heart and soul, I will plant them in  this land. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024032042" id="032042" >42</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah, As surely as I have brought  upon this people all this mass of misery, so surely will I  bring upon them all the blessings I promise them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032043" id="032043" >43</span>
 In this land that ye call a desolation, forsaken of man  and beast and delivered into the hands of the Chal- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024032044" id="032044" >44</span>
 deans, fields shall be bought once more. Yes, men  shall buy fields for money, subscribing and sealing the  deeds, and taking witnesses, in the district of Benjamin  and the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and the cities of  Judah, in the cities of the hill country, the lowland,  and the south. For I will restore their fortunes, saith  Jehovah. </p><h6>Jerusalem and Judah will be Pardoned, Restored, Made Glad and Renowned</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="033001">33</span> A second message from Jehovah came to Jeremiah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033002" id="033002" >2</span>
 while he was still confined in the guard-house. It  was this: Thus saith Jehovah, who created the earth  and formed it to stand fast – Jehovah is His name: <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024033003" id="033003" >3</span>
 "Call to Me, and in answer I will tell thee great and  hidden things, of which thou art unaware." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024033004" id="033004" >4</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning  the houses of this city and the royal palaces of Judah  which have been demolished to make a defence against 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033005" id="033005" >5</span>
 the siege-mounds and the sword. The Chaldeans are  coming to fight and to fill them with the dead bodies  of the men whom I have slain in Mine anger and fury,  and whose manifold wickedness has constrained Me 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033006" id="033006" >6</span>
 to hide My face from them. Nevertheless, I will close  up the city’s wounds and heal her completely, and I  will unveil to them treasures of peace and stability. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033007" id="033007" >7</span>
 The fortunes of Judah and Israel I will restore; and I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033008" id="033008" >8</span>
 will build them up as of old. I will cleanse them of all  the guilt of their sin against Me, and I will forgive all 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033009" id="033009" >9</span>
 the guilt of their sin and rebellion against Me. And  she shall be to Me a source of delight, of praise, and of  glory among all the nations of the earth, when they hear  of all the happiness that I shall achieve for them; and  they shall fear and tremble at all the happiness and all  the prosperity that I shall provide for them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024033010" id="033010" >10</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: In this place that you call a  desolation, forsaken of man and beast, in the cities of  Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033011" id="033011" >11</span>
 forsaken of man and beast, there shall once again be  heard the voice of mirth and gladness, the voice of  bridegroom and bride, the voice of those that say, as they  bring their thank-offerings into the House of Jehovah, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give thanks to Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah is gracious, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His kindness endureth for ever.  For I will restore the fortunes of the land, saith 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033012" id="033012" >12</span>
 Jehovah, as in the olden time. Thus saith Jehovah of  Hosts: In this place which is desolate, forsaken of  man and beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shall  again be homesteads of shepherds with flocks reclining. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033013" id="033013" >13</span>
 In the cities of the hill country, the lowland, and the  south, in the district of Benjamin, the neighbourhood of  Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, flocks shall once  more file past, to be counted under the hands (of the  shepherds), saith Jehovah. </p><h6>Promise of the Ideal King or Messiah</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024033014" id="033014" >14</span>
 Mark this, saith Jehovah; the days are coming when I will  perform My gracious promise to the households of Israel and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033015" id="033015" >15</span>
 Judah. In those days and at that time  I will raise up for David a righteous shoot, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall execute justice and right in the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024033016" id="033016" >16</span>
 In those days shall Judah be crowned with salvation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jerusalem in safety shall dwell: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the name men shall call her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our champion is Jehovah." </p><h6>Promise of the Perpetuity of the Davidic Dynasty and the Levitical Priesthood</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v024033017" id="033017" >17</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033018" id="033018" >18</span>
 upon the throne of the house of Israel; neither shall the  Levitical priests ever, for all time to come, want a man to  offer burnt-offerings in My presence or to burn oblations or to  do sacrifice. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024033019" id="033019" >19</span>
 Further, there came to Jeremiah this message from Jehovah, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033020" id="033020" >20</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: Not until ye can annul My covenant with  Day and Night, so that Day and Night shall come no more at 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033021" id="033021" >21</span>
 their appointed time – not until then shall My covenant be  annulled with David My servant, that a son od his should reign  upon his throne; or My covenant with the Levitical priests, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033022" id="033022" >22</span>
 My ministers. Numberless as the host of heaven, measureless  as the sand of the sea, shall I multiply the descendants of  David, My servant, and the Levitical priests, My ministers. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024033023" id="033023" >23</span>
 Jeremiah received this further message from Jehovah: Hast 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033024" id="033024" >24</span>
 thou observed what this people has been saying? They have  said that Jehovah has cast off the two families of His choice,  and in contempt for His people has ordained that they shall no 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033025" id="033025" >25</span>
 longer exist as a nation before Him? Well, thus saith  Jehovah: As surely as I have created Day and Night and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024033026" id="033026" >26</span>
 determined the order of heaven and earth, so surely will I never  cast off the descendants of Jacob and of David My servant,  or fail to select his descendants as rulers over the race of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; for I will have compassion upon  them and restore their fortunes. </p><h6>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah of the Folly of Resisting Babylon</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="034001">34</span> This message came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when  Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army,  and all the kingdoms and nations of the earth that  were under his dominion were fighting against 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034002" id="034002" >2</span>
 Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah: Thus saith  Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go to Zedekiah, king of  Judah, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: I am  about to deliver this city into the hands of the king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034003" id="034003" >3</span>
 Babylon, who will burn it with fire. As for thee, thou  shalt not escape out of his hands: thou wilt assuredly  be seized and into his hands delivered: thou shalt see  the king of Babylon eye to eye, and speak to him face 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034004" id="034004" >4</span>
 to face, and to Babylon thou shalt go. But listen,  Zedekiah, king of Judah, to the message of Jehovah:  Thus saith Jehovah concerning thee: Thou shalt not 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034005" id="034005" >5</span>
 die by the sword, but thou shalt die in peace. (Sweet  spices) shall be burned for thee, as for thine ancerstors  before thee, and lamentations shall be made for thee  with "Ah! Lord," for I, saith Jehovah, have spoken  the word. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024034006" id="034006" >6</span>
 Then Jeremiah the prophet delivered this message to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034007" id="034007" >7</span>
 Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, when the army  of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem,  and all the cities of Judah that were left, and Lachish  and Azekah – the only cities of Judah that remained as  fortified cities. </p><h6>Dishonest Attitude of the Jews to the Liberation of their</h6><p> Slaves: To be Punished by the Liberation of Disaster upon Themselves <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024034008" id="034008" >8</span>
 The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,  after the King Zedekiah had covenanted with all the people 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034009" id="034009" >9</span>
 in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty – each  man to set free his Hebrew slave, wether male or  female, so that no one of Jewish descent should serve 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034010" id="034010" >10</span>
 as slave any longer. Now all the princes and all the  people kept the covenant they had entered into to  liberate their several male and female slaves and to  treat them as slaves no longer: they kept it and set 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034011" id="034011" >11</span>
 them free. Afterwards, however, they turned and  forced back into slavery the male and female slaves  whom they had liberated. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024034012" id="034012" >12</span>
 Then there came to Jeremiah this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034013" id="034013" >13</span>
 Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel:  When I brought your forefathers out of the land of  Egypt, that house of slavery, I Myself made this 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034014" id="034014" >14</span>
 covenant that at the end of six years they were to  release any Hebrew brother who had sold himself to  them-after six years of service, they were to set him  free: your forefathers, however, would not listen 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034015" id="034015" >15</span>
 or incline their ear to Me. But you have in these days  acted in a very different spirit; you have done what  I desired in each proclaiming liberty to his (enslaved)  neighbour; in My presence you made a covenant 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034016" id="034016" >16</span>
 in the House that is called by My name. Now,  however, you have turned round and dishonoured My  name by forcing back again into slavery the several  male and female slaves you had set free to dispose of  themselves as they would. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024034017" id="034017" >17</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah: You have disobeyed  My injunction to make a proclamation of liberty, each of  you to his (enslaved) neighbour. Well, then, saith  Jehovah: You shall have your proclamation of liberty  from Me – (liberty) to the sword, pestilence and  famine – and I will make you an object of consternation 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034018" id="034018" >18</span>
 to every kingdom in the world. As for the men  that broke the covenant they had made in My presence,  when they passed between the pieces of the calf they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034019" id="034019" >19</span>
 had cut in two – I mean the princes of Judah and  Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests and all the people of  the land who passed between the pieces of the calf 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034020" id="034020" >20</span>
 they had cut in two – I will deliver them into the hands  of their enemies and of those that seek their life, and  their dead bodies shall be devoured by the birds of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024034021" id="034021" >21</span>
 air and the beasts of the earth. Further, Zedekiah,  king of Judah, and his princes, I will deliver into the  hands of their enemies and of those that seek their life,  and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon  which (for the moment) has raised the siege and left you. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024034022" id="034022" >22</span>
 Mark this well, saith Jehovah, I will issue My word of  command and bring them back to this city; they  shall assault it and take it and burn it with fire, and the  cities of Judah I will turn into an uninhabited desolation. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="035001">35</span> In the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of  Judah, Jeremiah received the following message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035002" id="035002" >2</span>
 Jehovah: Go to the clan of the Rechabites, talk with  them, bring them into one of the chambers (of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035003" id="035003" >3</span>
 Temple) and offer them wine to drink. So I took  Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaz-  ziniah, with his brothers and all his sons and the whole 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035004" id="035004" >4</span>
 Rechabite clan, and brought them into the Temple  chamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, the son of  Yigdaliah, the man of God, that was adjacent to the  chamber of the princes, above the chamber of  Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the Keeper of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035005" id="035005" >5</span>
 Threshold. I then set before the Rechabites bowls 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035006" id="035006" >6</span>
 full of wine and cups and told them to drink. "No,"  they said, "we will drink no wine; for Jonadab, the  son of Rechab, our ancestor, laid a charge upon us and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035007" id="035007" >7</span>
 our children to drink no wine, to build no houses, to sow  no seed, to plant and possess no vineyard for ever, but to  spend all our days in tents, so that we might live long on 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035008" id="035008" >8</span>
 the land where as strangers we dwell. In full obedience,  therefore, to this charge of Jonadab, the son of Rechab,  our ancestor, we have drunk no wine all our life long,  neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035009" id="035009" >9</span>
 daughters. We have built no houses to live in, we 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035010" id="035010" >10</span>
 have owned neither vineyard, field, nor seed, but  we have lived in tents and faithfully fulfilled all the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035011" id="035011" >11</span>
 instructions of our ancestors Jonadab. It was only  when the land was invaded by Nebuchadrezzar, king  of Babylon, that we decided to come to Jerusalem, to  escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies; that is  why we are (now) living in Jerusalem." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024035012" id="035012" >12</span>
 Then there came to Jeremiah this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035013" id="035013" >13</span>
 Jehovah: "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel:  Go and say to the men of Judah and the citizens of  Jerusalem: Should this not be a lesson to you to obey 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035014" id="035014" >14</span>
 My words, saith Jehovah? The injunction that  Jonadab the son of Rechab laid upon his sons to  drink no wine has been steadily observed: in obedience  to that ancestral charge they have abstained to this day.  But when I spoke to you early and late, you refused 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035015" id="035015" >15</span>
 to listen. Early and late I sent you all My servants the  prophets with the message to each man of you that, if  you would abandon your wicked ways, amend your  conduct, and no longer indulge in the service of other  gods, you should continue in the land that I gave your  forefathers; but you would not incline your ear or 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035016" id="035016" >16</span>
 listen to Me. Unlike the descendants of Jonadab the  son of Rechab, who have steadily observed the in-  junctions of their ancestor, this people has refused to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035017" id="035017" >17</span>
 listen to Me. Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts,  the God of Israel: See! I am about to bring upon  Judah and upon all the citizens of Jerusalem all the  misery with which I have threatened them, because  they refused to listen to My words or respond to My 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035018" id="035018" >18</span>
 call." But to the clan of the Rechabites Jeremiah said,  "Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel:  Because you have obeyed the injunction of your  ancestor Jonadab, keeping all his commandments and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024035019" id="035019" >19</span>
 fulfiling all his instructions, Jonadab, the son of Rechab  shall never want a man to minister to Me, while the  earth stands.  and Contemptuously Burned by King Jehoiakim <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="036001">36</span> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah,  king of Judah, Jeremiah received the following message 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036002" id="036002" >2</span>
 from Jehovah: Take a book-roll, and write on it all  the messages I have communicated to thee with regard  to Israel and Judah and all nations, from My first  message to thee in the days of Josiah right on to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036003" id="036003" >3</span>
 present day. It may be that, when the people of  Judah hear of all the misery I am planning to bring  upon them, they will severally abandon their wicked  ways, and receive at My hands pardon for their guilt  and sin. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036004" id="036004" >4</span>
 Then Jeremiah summoned Baruch, the son of Neriah,  who wrote down on a book-roll to Jeremiah’s dic-  tation all the messages Jehovah had communicated to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036005" id="036005" >5</span>
 him. Thereafter Jeremiah gave instructions to  Baruch in the following terms: "Seeing that I am  personally under restraint and debarred from access 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036006" id="036006" >6</span>
 to the Temple, do you go and, on the day appointed  for fasting, read aloud in the Temple the messages of  Jehovah in the hearing of the people from the roll  which you have written to my dictation; read them  also in the hearing of the Judeans who come from their 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036007" id="036007" >7</span>
 respective country towns. It may be that they will  humbly supplicate Jehovah, and severally abandon  their wicked ways: for great is the anger and fury 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036008" id="036008" >8</span>
 with which Jehovah has threatened this people." In  accordance, therefore with his instructions from  Jeremiah the prophet, Baruch read aloud from the  book the words of Jehovah in the Temple. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036009" id="036009" >9</span>
 Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, a sacred fast was  proclaimed by all the people resident in Jerusalem,  and all those also present from the country towns of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036010" id="036010" >10</span>
 Judah. Then in the hearing of all the people Baruch  read from the book the messages of Jeremiah from the  room that belonged to Gemariah, the son of Shaphan  the Secretary of State, which was situated in the upper 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036011" id="036011" >11</span>
 court at the entrance to the new Temple gate. Now  when Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of  Shaphan, had heard the messages of Jehovah as they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036012" id="036012" >12</span>
 were read from the book, he went down to the palace  to the room of the Secretary of State, and there he found  the whole court seated – Elishama, the Secretary and  Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elanthan, the  son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and  Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and indeed the whole 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036013" id="036013" >13</span>
 court. Micaiah proceeded to inform them of all the  words he had heard Baruch read out of the book in the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036014" id="036014" >14</span>
 hearing of the people. The whole court accordingly  despatched a messenger to Baruch, namely one Jehudi,  the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of  Cushi, with instructions to Baruch to appear, bring-  ing with him the roll from which he had read in the  hearing of the people. So Baruch, the son of Neriah,  appeared before them with the roll in his hand. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036015" id="036015" >15</span>
 Then they told him to sit down and read it in their 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036016" id="036016" >16</span>
 hearing; so Baruch read while they listened. When  they had heard it all, they turned to one another in  consternation, exclaiming to Baruch that they were 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036017" id="036017" >17</span>
 bound to inform the king of all this. They then  asked Baruch to explain how he had written all these 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036018" id="036018" >18</span>
 words. Baruch replied that Jeremiah had dictated  them all to him, and he had written them down with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036019" id="036019" >19</span>
 ink in the book. "Well, then," said the princes to  Baruch, "go into hiding, you and Jeremiah, and let 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036020" id="036020" >20</span>
 nobody know where you are." After they had  deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the  Secretary, they visited the king in his apartment,  and reported the whole matter to him. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036021" id="036021" >21</span>
 The king then despatched Jehudi to fetch the roll;  and, when he had brought it form Elishama’s chamber,  he read it in the hearing of the king and of all the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036022" id="036022" >22</span>
 courtiers who were in attendance upon him. Now  the king was sitting in the winter house, and the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036023" id="036023" >23</span>
 fire on the brazier was burning before him; and  every three or four columns that Jehudi read, the king  would cut up with his penknife and fling into the fire  that was on the brazier, till the whole roll was con- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036024" id="036024" >24</span>
 sumed in the fire that was on the brazier. But there  was no sense of horror either on the part of the king  or of any of his ministers as they listened to all these 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036025" id="036025" >25</span>
 words, nor did they rend their garments. Elnathan,  Delaiah, and Gemariah, however, had entreated the  king not to burn the roll, but he would not listen to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036026" id="036026" >26</span>
 them. Then the king commanded the royal prince  Jerachmeel, and seraiah, the son of Azriel, and  Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribe  and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah kept them in  concealment. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036027" id="036027" >27</span>
 After the king had burned the roll containing the  words written by Baruch to Jeremiah’s dictation, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036028" id="036028" >28</span>
 Jeremiah received this message from Jehovah, "Once  more take another roll, and write on it all the words  that were on the first roll that was consigned to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036029" id="036029" >29</span>
 flames by Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Thus saith  Jehovah: Thou hast taken it upon thee to burn this  roll and to demand my reason for recording the threat  that the king of Babylon would assuredly come and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036030" id="036030" >30</span>
 destroy this land, and clear it of man and beast. There-  fore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of  Judah: Never a man shall he have to sit upon the  throne of David; his dead body shall be flung out and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024036031" id="036031" >31</span>
 exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night. I  will punish him, his descendants, and his ministers, for  their sins; and I will bring upon them and upon the  citizens of Jerusalem all the misery with which I  threatened them in vain." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024036032" id="036032" >32</span>
 Then Jeremiah took another roll and gave it to  Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it  to Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the book that  had been burned by Jehoiakim; and it was supple-  mented by many messages of a similar kind. </p><h6>Experiences of Jeremiah During the Siege and at the Capture of Jerusalem</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="037001">37</span> Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah was reigning in place  of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, having been set upon  the throne of Judah by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Baby- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037002" id="037002" >2</span>
 lon; but neither he nor his ministers nor the people  of the land gave any heed to the messages Jehovah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037003" id="037003" >3</span>
 had delivered by the prophet Jeremiah. King  Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah,  and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to  Jeremiah, with the request that he would pray for 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037004" id="037004" >4</span>
 them to Jehovah their God. Now Jeremiah, who had  not yet been put in prison, was still coming and  going among the people. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024037005" id="037005" >5</span>
 The Chaledeans who were engaged in the siege of  Jerusalem, having received a report that Pharaoh’s  army was advancing from Egypt, abandoned the siege. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037006" id="037006" >6</span>
 Then there came to Jeremiah this message from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037007" id="037007" >7</span>
 Jehovah, Thus saith Jehovah: Tell the king of  Judah who hath sent thee to consult Me, that  Pharaoh’s army which is advancing to your aid 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037008" id="037008" >8</span>
 shall return to Egypt to their own land; and the  Chaldeans will come back and assault this city 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037009" id="037009" >9</span>
 and take it and burn it with fire. Thus saith Jehovah:  Do not delude yourselves with the idea that the Chal-  deans will leave you for good: they will do nothing of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037010" id="037010" >10</span>
 the kind. For even if you defeated the whole  Chaldean army that is fighting against you, so com-  pletely that the only survivors were wounded men – a  man to a tent– even they would rise up and burn this  city with fire. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024037011" id="037011" >11</span>
 When, in view of the advance of Pharoah’s army,  the Chaldean forces had abandoned the siege of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037012" id="037012" >12</span>
 Jerusalem, Jeremiah made a journey from Jerusalem  to the district of Benjamin to receive his inheritance 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037013" id="037013" >13</span>
 among the people. He had just reached the Benjamin  gate when he was apprehended there by a sentry  named Jirijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of  Hananiah, who called out, "You are deserting to the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037014" id="037014" >14</span>
 Chaldeans." "It is false, said Jeremiah, "I am  not deserting to the Chaldeans." But Jirijah, refusing  to listen, apprehended Jeremiah and brought him 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037015" id="037015" >15</span>
 before the courtiers, who in their exasperation had  Jeremiah flogged and put in the house of Jonathan,  the Secretary of State, which they had turned into a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037016" id="037016" >16</span>
 prison. So Jeremiah found himself in the cells of the  dungeon, where he remained for a considerable time. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024037017" id="037017" >17</span>
 Then King Zedekiah sent for him and questioned  him secretly in his house whether there was any com-  munication from Jehovah. "There is," said Jeremiah;  "you will be delivered into the hands of the king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037018" id="037018" >18</span>
 Babylon. Further," said Jeremiah to the king,  "what is my crime against you or your ministers or 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037019" id="037019" >19</span>
 this people that you have put me in prison? Where  are your prophets (now) that assured you that the king 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037020" id="037020" >20</span>
 of Babylon would never invade this country? And  now I beseech your Majesty to listen with favour to my  supplication, and not to allow me to be taken back  to the house of Jonathan the Secretary, where I am 
<span class="verse" rel="v024037021" id="037021" >21</span>
 likely to perish." Jeremiah was accordingly committed  by royal command to the guard-court, and furnished  with a loaf of bread a day from the Baker’s Street, till  all the bread in the city was consumed. So Jeremiah  remained in the guard-court.  Rescued by Ebedmelech, a Foreigner <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="038001">38</span> Now Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, the  son of Pashhur, and Juca, the son of Shelemiah, and  Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, ahd heard Jeremiah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038002" id="038002" >2</span>
 addressing all the people in words like these: "Thus  saith Jehovah: Whoever remains in this city shall die  by sword, famine and perstilence; but whoever goes  over to the Chaldeans shall be spared, though he shall 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038003" id="038003" >3</span>
 escape with nothing but his life." Also, "Thus saith  Jehovah, This city shall most assuredly be delivered  into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038004" id="038004" >4</span>
 it shall be captured." Whereupon those courtiers  said to the king, "We petition you to have this fellow  put to death: this sort of talk is unnerving all the  people and the soldiers left in the city. This fellow 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038005" id="038005" >5</span>
 does not want to help the city, but to ruin it." "He  is in your power," said the king; for he was helpless 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038006" id="038006" >6</span>
 against them. So they took Jeremiah and, lowering  him with ropes, they threw him into the cistern of the  royal prince Malchiah, that was in the guard-court.  There was no water in the cistern, but only mud;  and Jeremiah sank in the mud. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024038007" id="038007" >7</span>
 Now it came to the ears of Ebedmelech, an Ethiopian  eunuch attached to the palace, that they had put 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038008" id="038008" >8</span>
 Jeremiah in the cistern. Ebedmelech accordingly left  the palace for the Benjamin gate where the king  happened to be sitting at the time, and thus he 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038009" id="038009" >9</span>
 addressed him: "Your Majesty, these men have  behaved most wrongfully in their treatment of Jeremiah  the prophet; they have flung him into the cistern and  he will die of hunger on the spot, for there is no more 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038010" id="038010" >10</span>
 bread in the city." At once the king ordered  Ebedmelech to take with him three me and pull  Jeremiah out of the cistern before he perished. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038011" id="038011" >11</span>
 Ebedmelech, accordingly, taking the men with him,  went to the palace, and secured form (a lumber room)  underneath the treasury some torn and tattered rags,  and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah into the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038012" id="038012" >12</span>
 cistern. Then he told Jeremiah to put the torn and  tattered rags under his armpits beneath the ropes; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038013" id="038013" >13</span>
 and Jeremiah did so. Then they drew him up with the  ropes and pulled him out of the cistern; and Jeremiah  remained in the guard-court. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024038014" id="038014" >14</span>
 King Zedekiah afterwards sent and had Jeremiah  brought to him at the third entry that leads into the  Temple; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am going  to ask you a question which you are to answer me 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038015" id="038015" >15</span>
 unreservedly." "If I tell you," said Jeremiah, "are  you not certain to put me to death? besides, any advice 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038016" id="038016" >16</span>
 I give you, you will simply disregard." Then, in secret,  the king swore the following oath to Jeremiah, "As  Jehovah liveth, who created this life of ours, I assure  you solemnly that I will neither put you to death nor  deliver you into the hands of those men that are seek- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038017" id="038017" >17</span>
 ing your life." Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah,  "Thus saith Jehovah, If you surrender voluntarily to  the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be  spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, but 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038018" id="038018" >18</span>
 you and your family will be spared. If, however, you  refuse to surrender, then this city shall be delivered  into the handso of the Chaldeans, who will burn it with  fire; and you shall not escape from their hands." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038019" id="038019" >19</span>
 Then the king said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the  Jews who have gone over to them and subjected to violence." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038020" id="038020" >20</span>
 "No," said Jeremiah, "you will not be handed over.  But I entreat you to listen to what I say – it is the  voice of Jehovah: your happiness and your life depend 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038021" id="038021" >21</span>
 upon it. But if you refuse to surrender, then this is  the message revealed to me in a vision by Jehovah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038022" id="038022" >22</span>
 –mark it well; (I saw) all the women that are left in  the palace of the king of Judah brought out to the chief  officers of the king of Babylon, chanting the while this  song: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy most excellent friends have beguiled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And prevailed over thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy feet they have thrust in the mire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus sinking have left thee. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024038023" id="038023" >23</span>
 All your wives and children they shall bring out to  the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape; you  will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon; and  this city shall be burned with fire." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024038024" id="038024" >24</span>
 "Well, then," said the king to him, "let nobody  know anything of this conversation, or else you are a dead 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038025" id="038025" >25</span>
 man. If the courtiers hear that I have been talking  with you, and come and ask you to tell them un-  reservedly, on pain of death, what you have been saying 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038026" id="038026" >26</span>
 to the king and the king to you, then just tell them that  you were presenting a petition to the king that you  should not be taken back to Jonathan’s house, where 
<span class="verse" rel="v024038027" id="038027" >27</span>
 you were in danger of perishing." In point of fact, the  courtiers did all come to Jeremiah and question him;  and the story he told them was in entire accordance  with the king’s instructions. So they said no more to  him, for no part of the conversation had been heard. 
<span class="verse" rel="v02403828a" id="03828a" >28a</span>
 Jeremiah accordingly remained in the guard-court  till the day Jerusalem was taken. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v02403828b" id="03828b" >28b</span>
 When Jerusalem was taken, all the chief officers of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039003" id="039003" >3</span>
 the king of Babylon came and took their seats  in the middle gate – Nergalsharezer the Rab-mag,  Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and all the rest of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039014" id="039014" >14</span>
 Officers of the king of Babylon. They sent and had  Jeremiah brought from the guard-court, and delivered  him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of  Shaphan, to be taken to his own home; so he stayed  among the people. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="039001">39</span> In the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah,  king of Judah, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon came  with all his forces against Jerusalem and laid siege to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039002" id="039002" >2</span>
 it. On the ninth day of the fourth month of the  eleventh year of Zedekiah a breach was made in the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039004" id="039004" >4</span>
 city. On observing this, Zedekiah, king of Judah, and  all the soldiers took to flight, leaving the city during the  night by way of the royal garden, by the gate between  the two walls, and they made for the Jordan valley. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039005" id="039005" >5</span>
 But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook  Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho. They seized him  and brought him to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,  who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath, and he 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039006" id="039006" >6</span>
 pronounced judgment upon them. At Riblah the  king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his  eyes, and all the noblemen of Judah also did the king 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039007" id="039007" >7</span>
 of Babylon slay. He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes,  and loaded him with chains to carry him to Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039008" id="039008" >8</span>
 The palace and the houses of the people the Chaldeans  burned with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039009" id="039009" >9</span>
 demolished. The rest of the people that were left in the  city, and the deserters who had gonve over to him, and  those that werer left of the artificers, Nebuzaradan, the  commander of the guard, carried to exile in Babylon. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039010" id="039010" >10</span>
 Some of the poor people who had nothing were left by  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, in the land  of Judah, and presented at the same time with vine-  yards and fields. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024039011" id="039011" >11</span>
 With regard to Jeremiah, Nebuchadrezzar, king of  Babylon, had instructed Nebuzardan, the commander 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039012" id="039012" >12</span>
 of the guard, to do him no harm, but to take and look  well afer him and treat him according to his own 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039013" id="039013" >13</span>
 instructions. So a messenger was despatched from  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, and  Nebuzaradan, the Rab-saris, and Nergalsharezer, the  Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of  Babylon. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024039015" id="039015" >15</span>
 During Jeremiah’s detention in the guard-court,  there had come to him this message from Jehovah: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039016" id="039016" >16</span>
 Go and say to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: I will bring upon  this city all that I have said – for evil and not for good,  and in that day it will be accomplished before thine 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039017" id="039017" >17</span>
 eyes. But, saith Jehovah, I will deliver thee on that  day, and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024039018" id="039018" >18</span>
 men thou dreadest. I will save thee without fail;  thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thou shalt escape  with thy life, because, saith Jehovah, thou hast put  thy trust in Me. </p><h6>Experiences of Jeremiah After the Capture of Jerusalem</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="040001">40</span> The message which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah  after he had been released from Ramah by Nebuzar-  adan, the commander of the guard, who had found him  there in chains among the captives of Jerusalem and  Judah, who were being carried to exile in Babylon. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024040002" id="040002" >2</span>
 The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and said  to him: "Jehovah, your God, pronounced this doom 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040003" id="040003" >3</span>
 upon this place, and He has kept His word. You  have sinned against Him and refused to listen to His 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040004" id="040004" >4</span>
 voice, and so this thing is come upon you. But see now,  I will release you at once from the chains on your hands.  If you are disposed to accompany me to Babylon  come and I will look well after you; but if not, then  leave it alone. The whole land is before you; go 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040005" id="040005" >5</span>
 wherever you choose and prefer. Go back to Gedaliah,  the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king  of Babylon has appointed Governor of the cities of  Judah: stay with him among the people or go wherever  you choose." Then the commander of the guard  dismissed him with a gift of provisions and a present. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040006" id="040006" >6</span>
 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah at Mizpah, where he  stayed with him among the people left in the land. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024040007" id="040007" >7</span>
 When all the commanders of the forces in the open  field, together with their men, heard that the king of  Babylon had appointed Gedaliah Governor of the land,  and charged him with the oversight of the men, women  and children, and of the poorest of the land, such as

 had not been carried to exile in Babylon, they came  with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah – Ishmael the  son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of  Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of  Ephai of Netophah, and Jezaniah, the son of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040009" id="040009" >9</span>
 Maacathite. And Gedaliah gave his oath to them and  their men: "Don’t be afraid," he said, "of the  Chaldean officials. You will prosper if you stay in the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040010" id="040010" >10</span>
 land and serve the king of Babylon. As for myself,  I will reside at Mizpah, to represent your interests  when the Chaldean (officials) visit us; and you can  gather wine, fruit, and oil, and store them up and live 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040011" id="040011" >11</span>
 in the towns you take possession of." Further, all the  Jews that were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, or elsewhere,  when they heard that the king of Babylon had granted  permission to some to remain in Judah and had ap- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040012" id="040012" >12</span>
 pointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Governor, they  all returned to Judah from all the places to which they  had been driven – to Gedaliah at Mizpah – and they  gathered immense stores of wine and fruit. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024040013" id="040013" >13</span>
 Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the com-  manders of the forces in the open field came to Gedaliah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040014" id="040014" >14</span>
 at Mizpah, and asked him whether he was aware  that Baalis king of Ammon had sent Ishmael the son of  Nethaniah to assasiante him. But Gedaliah would 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040015" id="040015" >15</span>
 not believe it. Then Johanan, in a secret audience with  Gedaliah at Mizpah, said to him: "I beseech you to  allow me to go and slay Ishmael. Nobody need know.  Why should he take your life? that will mean the  scattering of all the Jews that have gathered round 
<span class="verse" rel="v024040016" id="040016" >16</span>
 you, and the ruin of all that is left of Judah." "No,"  said Gedaliah to Johanan, "do nothing of the kind:  what you say of Ishmael is not true." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="041001">41</span> In the seventh month, however, Ishamael, the son  of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, a member of the  royal family, accompanied by one of the chief officers of  the king and ten (other) men, paid a visit to Gedaliah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041002" id="041002" >2</span>
 at Mizpah. While they were all dining together there,  Ishmael and the ten men who accompanied him rose  and with the sword smote and slew Gedaliah, whom the  king of Babylon had appointed Governor of the land, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041003" id="041003" >3</span>
 together with all the Jews who were with him in  Mizpah and all the Chaldean soldiers who happened  to be there. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024041004" id="041004" >4</span>
 The day after the murder of Gedaliah, of which no 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041005" id="041005" >5</span>
 one was yet aware, eighty pilgrims from Shechem,  Shiloh, and Samaria, with beards shaven, clothes rent  and gashes (on their bodies), came with vegetable offer-  ings and frankincense in their hand to present them at 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041006" id="041006" >6</span>
 the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went out from Mizpah  to meet them, and they were weeping as they went  along. When he meet them, he invited them to come to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041007" id="041007" >7</span>
 Gedaliah; but when they were well within the town,  he and the men who accompanied him slew them at 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041008" id="041008" >8</span>
 the cistern. Ten of their number, however, entreated  Ishmael not to kill them: "for we have stores of  wheat," they said, "and barley, oil, and honey, buried  in the ground." So he let them alone and did not 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041009" id="041009" >9</span>
 consign them to the doom of their brethren. Now  the cistern into which Ishmael had cast all the corpses  of the men he had slain was the great cistern which  had been constructed by king Asa in his war against  Baasha, king of Israel; and this Ishmael filled with the  slain. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024041010" id="041010" >10</span>
 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the  people that were at Mizpah, the princesses and all the  people left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the com-  mander of the guard, had committed to the charge of  Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam; and he started across to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041011" id="041011" >11</span>
 Ammon. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and  all the commanders of the forces that were with him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041012" id="041012" >12</span>
 heard of all the atrocities perpetrated by Ishmael, they  took all their men and set out to attack him; and they 
<span class="verse" rel="v02404113a" id="04113a" >13a</span>
 found him by the great waters of Gibeon. All the 
<span class="verse" rel="v02404114a" id="04114a" >14a</span>
 people with Ishmael – all that he had carried captive 
<span class="verse" rel="v02404113b" id="04113b" >13b</span>
 from Mizpah – when they saw Johanan and the com-  manders of the forces that were with him, were filled 
<span class="verse" rel="v02404114b" id="04114b" >14b</span>
 with joy; and turning about, they came back and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041015" id="041015" >15</span>
 joined Johanan. But Ishmael, escaping with eight  men, repaired to Ammon. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024041016" id="041016" >16</span>
 Then Johanan and all the commanders of the forces  that were with him, tool all the rest of the people whom  Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah, after  his assassination of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam – men,  women, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041017" id="041017" >17</span>
 Gibeon. Then they took their journey and stayed  awhile at the sheepfolds of Chimham in the neighbour-  hood of Bethlehem, from which they intended to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024041018" id="041018" >18</span>
 travel to Egypt; for they were in terror of the  Chaldeans, because Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah,  whom the king of Babylon had appointed Governor of  the land. <span class="chapter" id="042001">42</span> Then all the commanders of the forces, together  with Johanan, and Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042002" id="042002" >2</span>
 all the people great and small, approached Jeremiah  the prophet with a petition, which they commended to  his most favourable consideration, that he would pray  for them, remnant as they were, to Jehovah his God.  "We are left," they said, "but a few out of many, as 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042003" id="042003" >3</span>
 you see with your own eyes. Let Jehovah your God  tell us the way we should go and the things we should do." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042004" id="042004" >4</span>
 Jeremiah replied, "I have heard you; I promise to  pray to Jehovah our God, as you request; and what-  ever be Jehovah’s answer I will tell you unreservedly." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042005" id="042005" >5</span>
 Whereupon they said to Jeremiah, "Jehovah be our  true and faithful Witness that we will act entirely in  accordance with any message that Jehovah your God 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042006" id="042006" >6</span>
 may send us. We have sent you to Jehovah our God;  and, be it welcome or unwelcome, we will obey His  voice, and so enjoy the prosperity that comes from  obedience to the voice of Jehovah our God." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024042007" id="042007" >7</span>
 After an interval of ten days, Jeremiah received a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042008" id="042008" >8</span>
 message from Jehovah. He accordingly summoned  Johanan and all the commanders of the forces that  were with him, and all the people, small and great, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042009" id="042009" >9</span>
 and thus he addressed them. "Thus saith Jehovah,  the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042010" id="042010" >10</span>
 supplication: If you remain quitely in this land, I will  build you up and not throw you down; I will plant you  and not pluck you up: for I am grieved at the misery 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042011" id="042011" >11</span>
 I have brought upon you. You are afraid of the king of  Babylon, but do not be afraid of him, saith Jehovah;  do not be afraid of him, for I will be with you, to save 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042012" id="042012" >12</span>
 you and to deliver you from his hand. I will have  pity upon you and inspire him with pity for you, so  that he will allow you to remain in your own land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042013" id="042013" >13</span>
 You may, however, disregard the voice of Jehovah your 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042014" id="042014" >14</span>
 God, and refuse to remain in this land: you may say,  ’No; we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall  see no war and hear no sound of trumpet and never  suffer for lack of bread – and there we shall make our 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042015" id="042015" >15</span>
 home.’ In that case I call upon you that are left of  Judah to listen to the message of Jehovah. Thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you are really  determined to proceed to Egypt, and if you go and settle 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042016" id="042016" >16</span>
 there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake you  there in the land of Egypt, and the hunger that you  dread shall cling to your heels there in Egypt, and there 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042017" id="042017" >17</span>
 ye shall die; and all the men that were determined  to go and settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, famine,  and pestilence; not one shall survive or escape the dis- 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042018" id="042018" >18</span>
 aster that I will bring upon them. For thus saith  Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine anger  and fury have been poured out upon the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured out upon you  when ye enter Egypt; and ye shall be an object of  execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and ye  shall see this place no more. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024042019" id="042019" >19</span>
 This is Jehovah’s message to you that are left of  Judah: ’Do not go to Egypt.’ But now be very sure 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042020" id="042020" >20</span>
 of this – I this day lay witness against you; you have  done yourselves a grievous wrong. You have sent  me to Jehovah your God with the request that I should  pray for you to Jehovah, and promising to act in  entire accordance with the will of Jehovah when I 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042021" id="042021" >21</span>
 declared it to you; but when I did declare it this day,  you refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah in respect 
<span class="verse" rel="v024042022" id="042022" >22</span>
 of any part of my commission. Now therefore be very  sure of this, that ye shall die by the sword, famine,  and pestilence, in the land where it is your desire to  go and settle." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="043001">43</span> When Jeremiah had finished addressing to the  assembled people all these words with which Jehovah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043002" id="043002" >2</span>
 had commissioned him, Azariah, the son of Hoshaniah,  and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the defiant and  insolent men exclaimed to Jeremiah, "You are a liar;  you have no commission to us from Jehovah to warn 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043003" id="043003" >3</span>
 us against going and settling in Egypt; but it is Baruch  the son of Neriah who is setting you on against us with  the object of delivering us into the hands of the  Chaldeans, to be killed or transported to Babylon." 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043004" id="043004" >4</span>
 So Johanan and all the commanders of the forces and  all the people refused to listen to the voice of Jehovah  which urged them to remain in the land of Judah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043005" id="043005" >5</span>
 Accordingly Johanan and all the commanders of the  forces took all that were now left of Judah – those that  had come back from all the nations to which they had 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043006" id="043006" >6</span>
 been driven, to settle in the land of Judah – the men,  the women, the princesses, and all the persons whom  Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had left  in the charge of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son  of Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043007" id="043007" >7</span>
 the son of Neriah; and, disregarding the voice of  Jehovah, they went to Egypt and arrived at Daphnae. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024043008" id="043008" >8</span>
 In Daphnae Jeremiah received the following message 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043009" id="043009" >9</span>
 from Jehovah: "Take large stones in thy hand and  hide them away in secret at the porch of Pharaoh’s  residence in Daphnae in the presence of a few of the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043010" id="043010" >10</span>
 men of Judah, and say to them, Thus saith Jehovah:  Mark this well – I will send and bring Nebuchadrezzar  the king of Babylon My servant, who shall set his  throne above these stones thou hast buried and spread 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043011" id="043011" >11</span>
 his glistening tapestry over them. He shall come and  smite the land of Egypt, devoting to death those  doomed to death, to captivity those doomed to captivity, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043012" id="043012" >12</span>
 to the sword those doomed to the sword. He shall  kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, he shall  clear the land of Egypt, as a shepherd clears his mantle  of vermin, and then he shall depart from it in comfort. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024043013" id="043013" >13</span>
 Also he will shatter the obelisks of Bethshemesh, in the  land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he  will burn with fire. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="044001">44</span> Concerning all the Jews whose home was in Egypt–  at Migdol, Daphnae, Memphis, and in upper Egypt– 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044002" id="044002" >2</span>
 Jeremiah received the following message: "Thus  saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have  seen with your own eyes all the misery that I have  wrought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of  Judah. Ye see what they are to-day – desolate and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044003" id="044003" >3</span>
 uninhabited – as a consequence of their wicked be-  haviour which provoked Mine indignation; for they  went and burned sacrifice in the service of other gods,  unknown alike to them or to you or your forefathers; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044004" id="044004" >4</span>
 and that, though early and late I had been sending to you  My servants the prophets to warn you against these 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044005" id="044005" >5</span>
 abominable practices that I detest. But they refused  to listen or incline their ear: they would no abandon 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044006" id="044006" >6</span>
 their wickedness or cease sacrificing to other gods. And  so Mine anger and fury were poured forth: it blazed in  the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, so  that they became the waste and the desolation that  they are to-day. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024044007" id="044007" >7</span>
 Now, therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of Hosts,  the God of Israel: Why are ye doing yourselves this  great wrong, which can only end in the utter extermin-  ation of Judah, man and woman, child and babe? 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044008" id="044008" >8</span>
 Why are ye vexing Me with the fabrications of your  hands, burning sacrifice to other gods in the land of  Egypt, where ye have come to settle? All this  can only end in your extermination and in your being  cursed and scorned by every nation in the world. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044009" id="044009" >9</span>
 Have you forgotten the crimes of your forefathers and  of the kings and princes of Judah, the crimes, too,  your own wives committed in the land of Judah and on 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044010" id="044010" >10</span>
 the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they have  remained unhumbled and unafraid. They have not  lived in accordance with My law or with the statutes  I set before you and your forefathers. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044011" id="044011" >11</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of  Israel: Mark this – I will set My face against you for 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044012" id="044012" >12</span>
 Evil, to exterminate Judah utterly. I will take the  remnant of Judah that were determined to come and  settle in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Egypt  they shall all be consumed; they shall fall by the sword  and by famine; small and great, they shall die by the  sword and by famine, and they shall be an object of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044013" id="044013" >13</span>
 execration and horror, of cursing and scorn; and,  as I have punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and  pestilence, so will I punish those that have made Egypt 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044014" id="044014" >14</span>
 their home, that not a man of the remnant of Judah  which has come to settel in Egypt shall escape or  survive to return to the land of Egypt for which  they shall yearn; for none but a fugitive or two  shall return." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024044015" id="044015" >15</span>
 Then the great gathering, composed of all the men  who were aware that their wives burned sacrifice to  other gods, and all the women that were standing by, 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044016" id="044016" >16</span>
 replied to Jeremiah thus: "We refuse to listen to this  message of yours that you have communicated to us in 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044017" id="044017" >17</span>
 the name of Jehovah: but we will most assuredly  keep our solemn oath to burn sacrifice to the Queen  of Heaven and to pour out drink-offerings in her  honour as we used to do – we and our fathers, our  kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and on the  streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044018" id="044018" >18</span>
 lived well and were untouched by misfortune. But  ever since the day we ceased burning sacrifice to the  Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink-offerings in  her honour, we have been utterly destitute, and sword 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044019" id="044019" >19</span>
 and famine have consumed us. Yes," said the women,  "as for our offering of sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven  and pouring out drink-offerings in her honour – have  we not had the approval of our husbands in making cakes  for her stamped with her image, and in pouring her  out drink-offerings?" <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024044020" id="044020" >20</span>
 Such was the answer of all the people, men and  women. Then Jeremiah addressed them as follows: 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044021" id="044021" >21</span>
 "Yes, you did indeed burn your sacrifices in the cities of  Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem – you and your  fathers, your kings and your princes and commons;  and is it not precisely this that rankled in the mind and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044022" id="044022" >22</span>
 heart of Jehovah, till He could bear your wicked and  abominable conduct no longer, with the result that your  country is become the uninhabited desolation, the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044023" id="044023" >23</span>
 horror, the curse that it is to-day? It is because you  have offered such sacrifces, sinning against Jehovah, dis-  obeying the voice of Jehovah, refusing to live in  accordance with His laws. His statutes, His expressed  will: that is why the misery of to-day is come upon  you." <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024044024" id="044024" >24</span>
 Further, Jeremiah said to the people and the women  assembled: "Listen to the message of Jehovah, all ye 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044025" id="044025" >25</span>
 Jews that are in the land of Egypt. Thus saith Jehovah  of Hosts, the God of Israel: Verily you women  have indeed carried out your solemn resolve faithfully  to perform the vows you have taken upon you, to burn  sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink-  offerings in her honour. Well, then, keep your word 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044026" id="044026" >26</span>
 and perform your vows. But listen now to the world of  Jehovah, all ye Jews who have made Egypt your home.  Mark this well: I have sworn, saith Jehovah, by My  great name, that never again in all the land of Egypt  shall My name be uttered by the lips of any man of  Judah in the oath ’As truly as the Lord Jehovah 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044027" id="044027" >27</span>
 liveth.’ Mark! I am watching over them for evil  and not for good; and every man of Judah in the  land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044028" id="044028" >28</span>
 famine, until there be an end of them. Some who  escape the sword in Egypt shall return to Judah, but  they shall be few in number; and then all the remnant  of Judah that have some to settle in Egypt shall know  whose word it is that stands – Mine or theirs. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024044029" id="044029" >29</span>
 And this, saith Jehovah, shall be to you the sign  that I will punish you in this place, to teach you that  My threats of disaster shall be confirmed upon you. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024044030" id="044030" >30</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah: I will give Pharaoh Hophra, king  of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies and of those that  seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah, king of Judah, into  the hands of Nebuchadrezzar. king of Babylon, his  enemy that sought his life." <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="045001">45</span> This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet  delivered to Baruch the son of Neriah, after he had  written these words in a book to Jeremiah’s dictation  in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king

<span class="verse" rel="v024046003" id="046003" >3</span>
 Set the buckler and shield in array, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And draw nigh for the battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046004" id="046004" >4</span>
 Set the buckler and shield in array, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And draw nigh for the battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046004" id="046004" >4</span>
 Harness the steeds, mount the chargers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand forth in your helmets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polish your spears, don your breastplates. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046005" id="046005" >5</span>
 Why are they turned in dismay– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their warriors crushed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fled apace without once looking backward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By terror beset? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046006" id="046006" >6</span>
 The swift cannot flee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the strong man escape: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; North by the banks of Euphrates <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stumble and fall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046007" id="046007" >7</span>
 Who is that rose up like the Nile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose waters toss like floods? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046008" id="046008" >8</span>
 It is Egypt that rose like the Nile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose waters toll like floods. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; " I will rise, I will cover the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And destroy," said he, "her inhabitants. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046009" id="046009" >9</span>
 Up, steeds; rage, ye chariots; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And forth, ye warriors, march– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Cush and Put, that handle the shield, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye Ludim, that bend the bow." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046010" id="046010" >10</span>
 But that day is the Lord Jehovah’s– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of revenge on His foes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sword shall devour to its fill, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be drunken with their blood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah of Hosts hath a sacrifice <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the northern land, by Euphrates. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046011" id="046011" >11</span>
 Up to Gilead, fetch thee balsam. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O virgin daughter of Egypt; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain dost thou multiply medicines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No healing is there for thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046012" id="046012" >12</span>
 The nations have heard thy wail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the earth is full of thy cry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For warrior stumbles on warrior, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both are fallen together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046013" id="046013" >13</span>
 The message of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, that <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; smite the land of Egypt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046014" id="046014" >14</span>
 Tell it Migdol, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publish it in Memphis: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, "Take thy stand and prepare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sword hath devoured round about thee." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046015" id="046015" >15</span>
 Wherefore is Apus fled? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy mighty one held not his ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because down he was thrust by Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046016" id="046016" >16</span>
 The strangers amonf thee are fallen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And prostate, they say each to other, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us flee from the muderous sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us rise and go back to our people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the land wherein we were born." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046017" id="046017" >17</span>

 As live, saith the King, whose name <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Jehovah of Hosts: One shall come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Tabor among the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Carmel by the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046019" id="046019" >19</span>
 O daughter that dwellest in Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare thee to go into exile; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Noph is become like a desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An uninhabited waste. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046020" id="046020" >20</span>
 A graceful heifer is Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a wasp from the north hath assailed her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404621e" id="04621e" >21e</span>
 For the day of disaster hath reached her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600f" id="04600f" >f</span>
 The time of her visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600a" id="04600a" >a</span>
 The warriors, too, that she hired, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600b" id="04600b" >b</span>
 Were like unto fatted calves: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600c" id="04600c" >c</span>
 As for them, together they turned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600d" id="04600d" >d</span>
 And fled, without making a stand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404622a" id="04622a" >22a</span>
 She hisseth like a serpent <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600b" id="04600b" >b</span>
 Against the advancing hosts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404623c" id="04623c" >23c</span>
 For more are they than locusts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600d" id="04600d" >d</span>
 So many they cannot be counted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404622c" id="04622c" >22c</span>
 Against her they come with axes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like men that hew down trees, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404623a" id="04623a" >23a</span>
 "Fell, saith Jehovah, "her forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02404600b" id="04600b" >b</span>
 For it is impenetrable," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046024" id="046024" >24</span>
 Put to shame is the daughter of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To men from the north given over. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046025" id="046025" >25</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; See! Amon of Thebes I will punish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Pharaoh and those that trust him; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046026" id="046026" >26</span>
 An I will deliver them over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those that seek their life, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King of Babylon, and his servants. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But afterwards she shall be peopled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in days of old, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046027" id="046027" >27</span>
 So fear them not, O Jacob My Servant; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Israel, be not dismayed, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For see! I will save both thee and thine offspring <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the far distant land where captive ye lie. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jacob once more shall have quite and ease <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own land, with no one to make him afraid; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024046028" id="046028" >28</span>
 So fear thou not, O Jacob My Servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I, saith Jehovah, am with thee (to save thee). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; An end I will make of the nations– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each, among whom I have driven thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But of thee I will not make an end. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not leave wholly unpunished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in measure I will chastise thee. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="047001">47</span> The message concerning the Philistines which  Jeremiah the prophet received from Jehovah, before  Pharaoh smote Gaza. Thus saith Jehovah: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047002" id="047002" >2</span>
 From the north, see! waters are rising, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They swell to a raging torrent: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They will sweep o’er the land and its fulness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city and (all) her inhabitants. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Men shall utter a cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that dwell in the land shall howl. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047003" id="047003" >3</span>
 At the noise of the hoofs of his galloping steeds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the rush of his chariots, the roar of his wheels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The father shall not look behind for the children; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all unnerved shall they be– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047004" id="047004" >4</span>
 Because of the day of destruction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That cometh on all the Philistines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeping from Tyre and Sidon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All helpers that yet remain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah shall work destruction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On all that are left in the coast-land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047005" id="047005" >5</span>
 Baldness is come upon Gaza, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashkelon is destroyed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye that are left of the Anakim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long must ye gash yourselves yet? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047006" id="047006" >6</span>
 "Ah! Sword of Jehovah! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long will it be ere thou rest? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Into thy scabbard get thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep thee quiet and still." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024047007" id="047007" >7</span>
 But how can it be quiet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Jehovah hath given it a charge? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath destined it for Ashkelon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the shore washed by the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="048001">48</span> Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas for the ruin of Nebo! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiriathaim is taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misgab is shamed and dismayed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048002" id="048002" >2</span>
 The renown of Moab is vanished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Heshbon they plotted her ruin: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, let us blot out the nation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, Madmen, shalt be silenced, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword shall follow thee hard." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048003" id="048003" >3</span>
 Hark! a shriek from Horonaim– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Havoc and fell destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048004" id="048004" >4</span>
 Moab is destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shriek can be heard far as Zoar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048005" id="048005" >5</span>
 They climb the ascent to Luhith, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeping the while as they go; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the path that leads down to Horonaim <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ringing with cries of destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048006" id="048006" >6</span>
 Fly, escape for your lives, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though like bare desert shrub shall ye be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048007" id="048007" >7</span>
 Thou hast trusted in thy strongholds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore art thou taken: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemosh shall pass into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His priests and his princes together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048008" id="048008" >8</span>
 Upon every city the spoiler shall come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No city shall escape; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The valleys shall also perish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the table-land be destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accord with the word of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048009" id="048009" >9</span>
 Give ye wings unto Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For fain would she fly away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From her cities that shll be desolate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And empty altogether. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048010" id="048010" >10</span>
 Cursed be he that doeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of Jehovah remissly; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And cursed be he that keepeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sword from (shedding) blood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048011" id="048011" >11</span>
 From his youth Moab been at ease, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his lees he hath quitely rested– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not emptied from vessel to vessel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever to exile borne; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so his taste remaineth in him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his scent is all unchanged. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048012" id="048012" >12</span>
 Therefore days, saith Jehovah, are coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tilters I will send; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall tilt him over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And empty out his vessels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dash his jars in pieces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048013" id="048013" >13</span>
 And the hopes of Moab in Chemosh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be utterly disappointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As Israel was disappointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bethel, wherein she trusted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048014" id="048014" >14</span>

 When the spoiler of Moab is come up against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the flower of her youth is gone down to the slaughter? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048016" id="048016" >16</span>
 The ruin of Moab is night at hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her misery hasteth swiftly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048017" id="048017" >17</span>
 Bemoan her, all ye her neighbours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ye that know her name: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; say, "How is the strong staff broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod that was so fair!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048018" id="048018" >18</span>
 Come down from thy splendour and sit in the mire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fortress he hath destroyed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048019" id="048019" >19</span>
 Stand by the way and spy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou that dwellest in Aroer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask of the fugitive men <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the women that flee, "What hath chanced?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048020" id="048020" >20</span>

 Tell it by the Arnon that Moab is laid waste. Judg- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ment is come upon the table-land – upon Holon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v024048025" id="048025" >25</span>
 Hewn off is the horn of Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her arm is broken, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048026" id="048026" >26</span>
 Make ye her drunken, for she <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath been insolent towards Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, Moab hath clapped her hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in turn shall she, too, be derided. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024048027" id="048027" >27</span>
 For didst thou hold Israel in derision? Hath  she then been detected in the company of thieves, that  thou shakest thy head so, every time thou speakest of  her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048028" id="048028" >28</span>
 Leave the cities and dwell in the crags, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye inhabitants of Moab; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And be like to the dove that nesteth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the holes of the rocks of the precipice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048029" id="048029" >29</span>
 We have heard of the pride of Moab– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How very proud is she– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; of her crafty and arrogant pride, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the haughtiness of her heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048030" id="048030" >30</span>
 Well I know her arrogance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The falseness of her boasting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the falseness of her behaviour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048031" id="048031" >31</span>
 There shall therfore be wailing in Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, shrieks from all quarters of Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And moans for the men of Kir-heres. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048032" id="048032" >32</span>
 For thee, O vine of Sibmah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be weeping as men weep for Jazer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy branches passed over the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They reached as far as Jazer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy summmer fruits and their vintage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the despoiler fallen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048033" id="048033" >33</span>
 Gladness and mirth are vanished <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Moab’s garden-land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No wine is trod in the presses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merry shout I have stilled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shout that is raised is of battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048034" id="048034" >34</span>
 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their voice doth reach unto Jahaz, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyyah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the waters of Nimrim shall also be desolate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048025" id="048025" >25</span>
 I will cause, saith Jehovah, to vanish from Moab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him that offereth in the high place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth sacrifice to his god. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048036" id="048036" >36</span>
 So my heart like a flute maketh moaning for Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart maketh moan for the men of Kir-heres; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the gain they had gotten is perished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048037" id="048037" >37</span>
 For every head is bald, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every beard is clipped: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On every hand are gashes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On every loin is sackcloth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048038" id="048038" >38</span>
 On Moab’s roofs and squares <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is universal wailing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Moab I have shattered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a vessel that one despiseth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048039" id="048039" >39</span>
 How broken is Moab! howl ye. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How she turneth her back in shame! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her neighbours shall all behold her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With horror and derision. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; One like a vulture shall swoop, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spread out his swings against Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048041" id="048041" >41</span>
 Keriyyoth is taken, the strongholds are seized. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That day shall the heart of the warriors of Moab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be like to the heart of a woman in anguish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048042" id="048042" >42</span>
 As a nation, Moab shall perish <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his insolence towards Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048043" id="048043" >43</span>
 Trap, terror, and pit are before you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ye that dwell in Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048044" id="048044" >44</span>
 He that flies from the terror shall fall down the pit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He that creeps from the pit shall be caught in the trap. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, this I will bring upon Moab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year of her visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048045" id="048045" >45</span>
 In the shadow of Heshbon stand fugitives– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All their strength now gone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a fire is gone forth from Heshbon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flame from the house of Sihon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Devouring the temples of Moab’s head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048046" id="048046" >46</span>
 Woe unto thee, O Moab! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Chemosh is perished; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sons are taken captive, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy daughters are led to captivity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Moab I will restore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter days, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far is the judgment upon Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="048001">48</span> Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas for the ruin of Nebo! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiriathaim is taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misgab is shamed and dismayed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048002" id="048002" >2</span>
 The renown of Moab is vanished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Heshbon they plotted her ruin: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, let us blot out the nation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, Madmen, shalt be silenced, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword shall follow thee hard." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048003" id="048003" >3</span>
 Hark! a shriek from Horonaim– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Havoc and fell destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048004" id="048004" >4</span>
 Moab is destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shriek canbe heard far as Zoar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048005" id="048005" >5</span>
 They climb the ascent to Luhith, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeping the while as they go; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the path that leads down to Horonaim <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ringing with cries of destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048006" id="048006" >6</span>
 Fly, escape for your lives, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though like bare desert shrub shall ye be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048007" id="048007" >7</span>
 Thou hast trusted in thy strongholds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore art thou taken: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemosh shall pass into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His priests and his princes together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048008" id="048008" >8</span>
 Upon every city the spoiler shall come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No city shall escape; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The valleys shall also perish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the table-land be destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accord with the word of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048009" id="048009" >9</span>
 Give ye wings unto Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For fain would she fly away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From her cities that shall be desolate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And empty altogether. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048010" id="048010" >10</span>
 Cursed be he that doeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of Jehovah remissly; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And cursed be he that keepeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sword from (shedding) blood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048011" id="048011" >11</span>
 From his youth hath Moab been at ease, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his lees he hath quitely rested– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not emptied from vessel to vessel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever to exile borne; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So his taste remaineth in him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And his scent is all unchanged. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048012" id="048012" >12</span>
 Therefore days, saith Jehovah are coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When tilters I will send; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall tilt him over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And empty out his vessels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dash his jars in pieces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048013" id="048013" >13</span>
 And the hopes of Moab in Chemosh <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be utterly disappointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As Israel was disappointed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bethel, wherein she trusted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048014" id="048014" >14</span>
 How can ye claim to be heroes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mighty men of war, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048015" id="048015" >15</span>
 When the spoiler of Moab is come up against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the flower of her youth is gone down to the slaughter? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048016" id="048016" >16</span>
 The ruin of Moab is night at hand, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her misery hasteth swiftly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048017" id="048017" >17</span>
 Bemoan her, all ye her neighbours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ye that know her name: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, "How is the strong staff broken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod that was so fair!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048018" id="048018" >18</span>
 Come down from thy splendour and sit in the mire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fortress he hath destroyed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048019" id="048019" >19</span>
 Stand by the way and spy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou that dwellest in Aroer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask of the fugitive men <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the women that fless, "What hath chanced?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048020" id="048020" >20</span>
 "Moab is put to shame: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is broken; howl ye and cry." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048021" id="048021" >21</span>
 Tell it by the Arnon that Moab is laid waste. Judg- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ment is come upon the table-land – upon Holon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048022" id="048022" >22</span>
 Jahzah, and Mephaath, upon Dibon, Nebo, and Beth- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Dibalathaim, upon Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth- <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 meon, upon Keriyyoth and Bozrah, and all the cities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; of the land of Moab, far and near. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048025" id="048025" >25</span>
 Hewn off is the horn of Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And her arm is broken, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048026" id="048026" >26</span>
 Make ye her drunken, for she <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath been insolent towards Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, Moab hath clapped her hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in turn shall she, too, be derided. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024048027" id="048027" >27</span>
 For didst thou not hold Israel in derision? Hath  she then been detected in the company of thieves, that  thou shakest thy head so, every time thou speakest of  her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048028" id="048028" >28</span>
 Leave the cities and dwell in the crags, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye inhabitants of Moab; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And be like to the dove that nesteth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the holes of the rocks of the precipice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048029" id="048029" >29</span>
 We have heard of the pride of Moab– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How very proud is she– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her crafty and arrogant pride, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the haughtiness of her heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048030" id="048030" >30</span>
 Well I know her arrogance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The falseness of her boasting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the falseness of her behaviour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048031" id="048031" >31</span>
 There shall therefore be wailing in Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, shrieks from all quarters of Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And moans for the men of Kir-heres. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048032" id="048032" >32</span>
 For thee, O vine of Sibmah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be weeping as men weep for Jazer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy branches passed over the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They reached as far as Jazer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy summer fruits and their vintage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the despoiler fallen. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048033" id="048033" >33</span>
 Gladness and mirth are vanished <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Moab’s garden-land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No wine is trod in the presses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merry shout I have stilled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shout that is raised is of battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048034" id="048034" >34</span>
 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their voice doth reach unto Jahaz, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyyah; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the waters of Nimrim shall also be desolate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048025" id="048025" >25</span>
 I will cause, saith Jehovah, to vanish from Moab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him that offereth in the high place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth sacrifice to his god. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048036" id="048036" >36</span>
 So my heart like a flute maketh moaning for Moab, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart maketh moan for the men of Kir-heres; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the gain they had gotten is perished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048037" id="048037" >37</span>
 For every head is bald, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every beard is clipped: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On every hand are gashes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On every loin is sackcloth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048038" id="048038" >38</span>
 On Moab’s roofs and squares <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is universal wailing; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Moab I have shattered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a vessel that one despiseth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048039" id="048039" >39</span>
 How broken is Moab! howl ye. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How she turneth her back in shame! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her neighbours shall all behold her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With horror and derision. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048040" id="048040" >40</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; One like a vulture shall swoop, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spread out his wings against Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048041" id="048041" >41</span>
 Keriyyoth is take, the strongholds are seized. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That day shall the heart of the warriors of Moab <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be like to the heart of a woman in anguish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048042" id="048042" >42</span>
 As a nation, Moab shall perish <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his insolence towards Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048043" id="048043" >43</span>
 Trap, terror, and pit are before you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ye that dwell in Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048044" id="048044" >44</span>
 He that flies from the terror shall fall down the pit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He that creeps from the pit shall be caught in the trap. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048045" id="048045" >45</span>
 In the shadow of Heshbon stand fugitives– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All their strength now gone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a fire is gone forth from Heshbon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flame from the house of Sihon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Devouring the temples of Moab’s head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024048046" id="048046" >46</span>
 Woe unto thee, O Moab! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Chemosh is perished; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sons are taken captive, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy daughters are led to captivity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Moab I will restore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter days, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far is the judgment upon Moab. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="049001">49</span> Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath Israel no sons, no heirs? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why then hath Milcom seized Gad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his people inhabit her cities? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049002" id="049002" >2</span>
 Therefore days, saith Jehovah, are coming, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When over Rabbah of Ammon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will bring the alarum of war. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A desolate mound shall she be, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with fire shall her daughters be burned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Israel shall hold once more <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land from which she was driven. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049003" id="049003" >3</span>
 Howl, ye children of Ammon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your capital is ruined; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gird you with sackcloth and wail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wander about in mourning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Milcom is gone into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His priests and his princes together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049004" id="049004" >4</span>
 Why gloriest thou in thy valley, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou daughter that livest at ease; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And trustest in thy reserves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking no one shall ever assail thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049005" id="049005" >5</span>
 Behold, I will bring on thee terror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all that are round about thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye shall all be driven headlong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wanderers none shall rally. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049006" id="049006" >6</span>
 But afterwards, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ammonites I will restore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049007" id="049007" >7</span>
 On Edom. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wisdom no more in Teman? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the wit of the prudent perished, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wisdom vanished clean? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049008" id="049008" >8</span>
 Turn, fly to retreats inaccessible, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye that dwell in Dedan; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I bring upon Esau his doom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of his visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049009" id="049009" >9</span>
 Gleaners are come upon thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will leave not a grape to glean; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, thieves in the night are come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will wreck to their heart’s content. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049010" id="049010" >10</span>
 For I have stripped Esau bare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his lurking-place uncovered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that hide himself he cannot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroyed is he to a man <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the arm of his brethen and neighbours. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049011" id="049011" >11</span>
 Leave thine orphans, and I will preserve them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy widows trust in Me. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024049012" id="049012" >12</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah: If those who did not  deserve to drink the cup must drink it nevertheless,  how canst thou expect to go utterly unpunished?  Nay, verily, thou shalt no escape, but drink it thou <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049013" id="049013" >13</span>
 shalt. For I have most solemnly sworn, saith Jehovah,  that Bozrah shall be a horror, a scorn, and a curse,  and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049014" id="049014" >14</span>
 Jehovah hath sent me tidings <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of an envoy despatched to the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To bid them gather against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rise up to do battle. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049015" id="049015" >15</span>
 For small in the eyes of the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, scorned among men, will I make thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049016" id="049016" >16</span>
 O how thou then wilt shudder! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pride of thy heart hath beguiled thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou that hauntest the clefts of the crags, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That holdest the heights of the hills. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though thou buildest thine eyrie as high as the eagle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even thence to the ground will I bring thee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049017" id="049017" >17</span>
 And Edom shall be a horror; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, horror-struck, all that pass by her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall hiss at her many wounds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049018" id="049018" >18</span>
 As when Sodom was overthrown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Gomorrah and her neighbours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No man shall dwell therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mortal shall sojourn there. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049019" id="049019" >19</span>
 Behold, as a lion comes up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the pastures of sheep from the jungle of Jordan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so will I chase them away, in a moment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And visit with vengeance their choicest rams. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is like Me? who will challenge Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What shepherd is there that will face Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049020" id="049020" >20</span>
 Therefore hear what Jehovah hath planned against Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The young shepherd lads shall be dragged away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their homestead assuredly smitten with horror. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049021" id="049021" >21</span>
 At the sound of their fall the earth doth tremble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And far as the Red Sea their cry shall be heard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049022" id="049022" >22</span>
 See! one like a vulture shall swoop, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spread out his wings against Bozrah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That day shall the heart of the warriors of Edom <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be like to the heart of a woman in anguish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049023" id="049023" >23</span>
 Hamath and Arpad are shamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For tidings of evil hath reached them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They melt for very care, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are restless, like the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049024" id="049024" >24</span>
 Damascus is all unstrung, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She betaketh herself to flight. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Trembling hath seized upon her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anguish hath taken hold of her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorrow like that of a woman in travail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v024049026" id="049026" >26</span>
 In her squares shall her young men lie fallen; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her warriors all shall be silenced <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049027" id="049027" >27</span>
 I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the palaces of Benhadad it shall devour. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024049028" id="049028" >28</span>
 On Kedar and the kingdom of Hazor, which  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote.  Thus saith Jehovah:  Arise, get ye up unto Kedar, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despoil the sons of the East, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049029" id="049029" >29</span>
 Their tents and their flocks shall be taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their hangings and all their vessels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (The foe) shall seize their camels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shout at them "Terrors encircle you." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049030" id="049030" >30</span>
 Turn, fly to retreats inaccessible, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye that dwell in Hazor; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath purposed and planned to destroy you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049031" id="049031" >31</span>
 "Arise and assail the nation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That liveth in ease and security, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangers to gates and bars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dwelling apart by themselves." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049032" id="049032" >32</span>
 Their camels shall fall a prey, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the throng of their herds shall be plundered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And those whose temples are clipped <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will scatter to all the winds; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I, saith Jehovah, will bring on them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruin from every side. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049033" id="049033" >33</span>
 A haunt of jackals shall Hazor become, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A perpetual desolation: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No man shall dwell therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mortal shall sojourn there. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024049034" id="049034" >34</span>
 The message concerning Elam which Jeremiah the  prophet received from Jehovah at the beginning of  the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049035" id="049035" >35</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will break the bow of Elam, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief weapon of their might. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049036" id="049036" >36</span>
 I will bring four winds upon them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the four ends of the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to all these winds will I scatter them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No nation shall there be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the outcasts of Elam shall come not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049037" id="049037" >37</span>
 I will fill them with dismay <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the presence of their foes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of those that seek their life. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will bring evil upon them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My glowing indignation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will send the sword to pursue them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I have consumed them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024049038" id="049038" >38</span>
 I will set My throne in Elam, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thence will I destroy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king and the princes together. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elam I will restore <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter days, saith Jehovah. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="050001">50</span> The message concerning Babylon and the land of the  Chaldeans that Jehovah communicated to Jeremiah  the prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050002" id="050002" >2</span>
 Tell ye the nations and publish it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publish it unreservedly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That Babylon is taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bel shamed, and Marduk dismayed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her images are shamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her idol-blocks are dismayed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050003" id="050003" >3</span>
 For a folk from the north hath assailed her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shall desolate her land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So that none may dwell therein– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, beast, are fled and gone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050004" id="050004" >4</span>
 In those days, at the time, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children of Israel shall come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the children of Judah together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall go on their way with weeping, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek Jehovah their God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050005" id="050005" >5</span>
 For Zion shall they ask, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With faces hitherward turned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, "Come, let us join Jehovah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a covenant everlasting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That never shall be forgotten." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050006" id="050006" >6</span>
 Lost sheep have My people been, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their shepherds have led them astray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have turned them away on the mountains; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From mountain to hill they have wandered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetful of the fold. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050007" id="050007" >7</span>
 All have devoured them that found them: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their enemies said "We are guiltless"– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they had offended Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fold, where righteousness dwelleth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah, the Hope of their fathers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050008" id="050008" >8</span>
 Flee ye from Babylon’s midst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get ye out from the land of Chaldea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like he-goats before the flock. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050009" id="050009" >9</span>
 For behold! I will rouse against Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A swarm of northern nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That shall set their array against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until they have overcome her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall shoot like a skilful warrior, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who doth not return empty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050010" id="050010" >10</span>
 Chaldea shall be despoiled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that spoil her shall have their fill. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050011" id="050011" >11</span>
 Though ye rejoice and be glad, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye that plunder My heritage; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though ye gambol like calves in the grass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And neigh like stalwart horses; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050012" id="050012" >12</span>
 Your mother shall deeply be shamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And abashed shall she be that bore you– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The hindermost of the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wilderness dry and desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050013" id="050013" >13</span>
 An empty desolation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the wrath of Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Horror-struck, all that pass by her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall hiss at her many wounds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050014" id="050014" >14</span>
 Set your array round Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ye that bend the bow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoot your arrows at her without stint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hath sinned against Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050015" id="050015" >15</span>
 Encirlce her with your war-cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already she hath surrendered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her buttresses are fallen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her walls are torn down. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis the vengeance of Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avenge yourselves upon her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do to her as she hath done. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050016" id="050016" >16</span>
 Root out of Babylon him that soweth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And him that wieldeth the sickle in harvest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To escape the murderous sword <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall each set his face to his people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each to his own land flee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050017" id="050017" >17</span>
 A scattered flock is Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By lions driven away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the king of Assyria devoured him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now at the last his bones <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have been gnawed by the king of Babylon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050018" id="050018" >18</span>
 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Israel: Behold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will punish the king and the land of Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I punished the king of Assyria. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050019" id="050019" >19</span>
 But Israel I will bring back to his homestead, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To pasture on Carmel and Bashan; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ephraim’s hills and in Gilead <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall fare to his heart’s content. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050020" id="050020" >20</span>
 In those days, at that time, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Israel should be searched, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No guilt shall in her be found; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no transgression in Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall any man discover: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those whom I spare I will pardon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050021" id="050021" >21</span>
 Get ye up to the land of Marrati, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the people that dwell in Pekod; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Slay and destroy them utterly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do all I command, saith Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050022" id="050022" >22</span>
 Hark! the alarum of war, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chaldea fell destrucion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; How is she hewn and shattered– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hammer of all the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What a horror among the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Babylon become! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050024" id="050024" >24</span>
 I sanred thee, and thou hast been taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Babylon, unaware: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art discovered and caught, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou hast challenged Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050025" id="050025" >25</span>
 Jehovah has opened His armoury, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And brought forth His weapons of wrath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath a work to do in Chaldea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050026" id="050026" >26</span>
 Assail her from every quarter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay her granaries bare; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pile her up like heaps of corn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And utterly detroy her; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let nothing of her be left. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050027" id="050027" >27</span>
 Slay ye all her bullocks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down let them go to the slaughter. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe unto them: for their day is come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of their visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050028" id="050028" >28</span>
 Hark! how they flee, they escape <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away from the land of Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To Zion, to tell how Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our God, hath avenged His Temple. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050029" id="050029" >29</span>
 Call against Babylon archers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All those that bend the bow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp round about against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let none of them escape. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Requite her for all she hath done, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And deal with her as she dealt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For her insolence towards Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy One of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050030" id="050030" >30</span>
 In her squares shall her young men lie fallen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her warriors all shall be silenced, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that day, saith Jehovah of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050031" id="050031" >31</span>
 See, Insolence, I will assail thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thy day is come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of thy visitation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050032" id="050032" >32</span>
 Then shall Insolence stumble and fall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And none shall lift her up; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will kindle a fire in her forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shall all her thickets devour. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050033" id="050033" >33</span>
 Thus saith Jehovah of Host: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The children of Israel are crushed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the children of Judah together; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their captors hold them fast <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And refuse to let them go. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050034" id="050034" >34</span>
 But mighty is their Redeemer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah of Hosts is His name. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He will surely defend their cause, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That He may give rest to the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And disquiet the people of Babylon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050035" id="050035" >35</span>
 A sword upon the Chaldeans, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon all the people of Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her princess and her wise men! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050036" id="050036" >36</span>
 A sword upon her diviners! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then shall their folly be manifest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A sword upon her warriors! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then how dismayed shall they be! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050037" id="050037" >37</span>
 A sword on her horses and chariots, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on all the strange folk in her midst! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall become as women. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A sword upon her treasures! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And plundered shall they be. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050038" id="050038" >38</span>
 A sword upon her waters! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dried up shall they be! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For she is a land of images, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with hideous (idols) they make themselves mad. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050039" id="050039" >39</span>
 So wild cats and wolves shall dwell there, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there shall ostriches dwell; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She shall not be re-peopled for ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or dwelt in through all generations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050040" id="050040" >40</span>
 As when Sodom was overthrown, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gomorrah and her neighbours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; No man shall dwell therein, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mortal shall sojourn there. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050041" id="050041" >41</span>
 See! a pople doth come from the north: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great nation and many kings <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the ends of the earth bestir them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050042" id="050042" >42</span>
 Bow they wield and javelin– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruel and pitiless they, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With a voice like the roar of the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they upon horses come riding, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrayed, like one man, for the battle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050043" id="050043" >43</span>
 The rumour of them hath come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the ears of the king of Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he is all unstrung; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Anguish hath seized upon him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pangs as of woman in travail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050044" id="050044" >44</span>
 Behold, as a lion comes up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the pastures of sheep from the jungle of Jordan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so will I chase them away in a moment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And visit with vengeance their choicest rams. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Wh is like Me? Who will challenge Me? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What shepherd is there that will face Me? <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024050045" id="050045" >45</span>
 Therefore hear what Jehovah hath planned against   Babylon, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And purposed against those that dwell in Chaldea: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The young shepherd lads shall be dragged away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their homestead assuredly stricken with horror. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024050046" id="050046" >46</span>
 At the shout, " She is taken," the earth doth tremble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the world their cry shall be heard. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="051001">51</span> Thus saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, I will raise against Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And those that dwell in Chaldea <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit of a destroyer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051002" id="051002" >2</span>
 I will send upon Babylon winnowers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall winnow and empty her land : <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, woe shall beset her about <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the day of her disaster. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051003" id="051003" >3</span>
 Let the archer bend his bow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand erect in his coat of mail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one of her young men spare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But destroy her whole host utterly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051004" id="051004" >4</span>
 Let them fall down slain in the land of Chaldea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stabbed upon her streets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02405105c" id="05105c" >5c</span>
 For their land is full of guilt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02405100d" id="05100d" >d</span>
 Against the Holy One of Israel; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02405100a" id="05100a" >a</span>
 But Israel and Judah were not forsaken <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v02405100b" id="05100b" >b</span>
 By their God, Jehovah of Hosts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051006" id="051006" >6</span>
 Fly from the midst of Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save every man his life, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest her guilt bring destruction upon you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Tis Jehovah’s day of revenge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a recompense He is requiting her. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051007" id="051007" >7</span>
 A golden cup is Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That made the whole earth drunken: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The nations drank of her wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore are they gone mad. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051008" id="051008" >8</span>
 On a sudden she falls, she is shattered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise ye your wail over her; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Take balsam for her pain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peradventure she may be healed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051009" id="051009" >9</span>
 We strove for Babylon’s healing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But past all healing was she; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we now will leave her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each to his own land go; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For her judgement reacheth to heaven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It mounts to the very clouds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051010" id="051010" >10</span>
 Jehovah hath shown that the right was ours: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let us tell in Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Jehovah our God hath done. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051011" id="051011" >11</span>
 Polish the arrows, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furbish the shields; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah hath stirred up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit of Media’s king. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath planned for the ruin of Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such is Jehovah’s vengeance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vengeance for His Temple. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051012" id="051012" >12</span>
 Hoist ye the flag for the march <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the walls of Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthen the watch, set watchmen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And get the ambush ready: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah hath planned and accomplished <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His treats on the people of Babylon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051013" id="051013" >13</span>
 Thou that art rich in treasure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dwellest by many waters, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine end is come, thy web is spun. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Jehovah of Hosts hath most solemnly sworn: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; " I will fill thee with men who will swarm like locusts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lift up against thee a shout of triumph. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051015" id="051015" >15</span>
 He created the earth by His power, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He established the world by His wisdom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stretched out the heavens by His skill. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051016" id="051016" >16</span>
 When He uttereth His voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waters roar in the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And He causeth vapours to rise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the uttermost ends of the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightings He made for the rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wind He brings out if His storehouses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051017" id="051017" >17</span>
 How foolish is man with his knowledge! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goldsmith is shamed by his image; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His idols are a delusion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And breath in them is none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051018" id="051018" >18</span>
 They are an empty mockery, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hour of their trial they shall perish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Not such is the Portion of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His God is the Framer of all things; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah of Hosts is His name. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051020" id="051020" >20</span>
 My hammer of war hast thou been, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thee I have shattered the nations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With thee have I kingdoms destroyed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051021" id="051021" >21</span>
 With thee horse and rider I shattered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And chariot and charioteer; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051022" id="051022" >22</span>

 And Babylon I will requite, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the people of all Chaldea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Before your eyes, saith Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wrong they have wrought upon Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051025" id="051025" >25</span>
 Behold, I will assail thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saith Jehovah, thou mount of destruction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That destroyest all the earth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will stretch out My hand against thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make thee a burning mountain. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 No corner-stones shalt thou furnish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no foundation stones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou, saith Jehovah, shalt be <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A perpetual desolation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051027" id="051027" >27</span>
 Raise a banner upon the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow the trumpet among the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare the nations against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summon against her the kingdoms <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Muster your troops against her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring up horses like locusts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051028" id="051028" >28</span>

 The earth is in tremor and anguish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah’s design against Babylon standeth– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the land of Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An uninhabited waste. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051030" id="051030" >30</span>
 The warriors of Babylon cease fight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stay within their fastnesses; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their strength is all dried up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are become like women. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her dwelling-places are burned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her bars are shattered to pieces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051031" id="051031" >31</span>
 Courier runs to meet courier, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And messenger to meet messenger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell the king of Babylon <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on all sides his city is taken. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051032" id="051032" >32</span>
 The ferries have been seized, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defences areburned with fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the men of war are confounded. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051033" id="051033" >33</span>
 For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Israel: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter of Babylon is now <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a threshing-floor, when it is trodden; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet a little while– <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for her shall the harvest-time come. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051034" id="051034" >34</span>
 Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath done me violent wrong: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath left me an empty vessel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath swallowed me up like a monster; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath filled his maw with my dainties, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then hath cast me out. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051035" id="051035" >35</span>
 Let her that inhabiteth Zion declare, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wrong done to me and my flesh be on Babylon!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Jerusalem say, "My blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be on them that dwell in Chaldea!" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051036" id="051036" >36</span>
 Thus therefore saith Jehovah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; See! I will defend thy cause, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will take vengeance for thee; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sea I will dry up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her fountain I will wither. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v024051037" id="051037" >37</span>
 Babylon shall become a ruin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place that jackals haunt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A place of horror and hissing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place where no man dwelleth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v024051040" id="051040" >40</span>
 I will bring them down to the slaughter, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the lambs or rams with goats. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The sea came up upon Babylon, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ’Neath the roar of her billows she sank. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Her cities were turned to a waste, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dry and desert land: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In then shall no man dwell, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mortal shall ever pass through them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For the spoiler is come upon Babylon; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mighty men are taken, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their bows are broken in pieces: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah is a God of requitals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And He will repay without fail. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The instructions given by Jeremiah the prophet to  Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, who  acted as quester-master, when he accompanied  Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth 
<span class="verse" rel="v024051060" id="051060" >60</span>
 Year of his reign. Now Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll 
<span class="verse" rel="v024051061" id="051061" >61</span>
 all the misery that was to come upon Babylon; and  he said to Seraiah, "When you arrive at Babylon, see 
<span class="verse" rel="v024051062" id="051062" >62</span>
 that you read all these words, and say: ’Thine, O  Jehovah, are these words; it is Thou that hast decreed  the destruction of this place – that never again shall it  be a home for man or beast, but that it shall remain a 
<span class="verse" rel="v024051063" id="051063" >63</span>
 desolation for ever.’ When you have finished reading  this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle 
<span class="verse" rel="v024051064" id="051064" >64</span>
 of the Euphrates, with the words: ’Thus shall Babylon  sink, to rise no more, because of all the misery that I  shall bring upon her.’" <br /><br /> Here end the words of Jeremiah. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="052001">52</span> Zedekiah, who was twenty-one years of age when he  came to the throne, reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.  His mother’s name was Hamutal, a daughter of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052002" id="052002" >2</span>
 Jeremiah of Libnah. His actions were offensive to 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052003" id="052003" >3</span>
 Jehovah was so angry with Jerusalem and Judah that  He cast them out of His sight; and Zedekiah revolted  against the king of Babylon. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052004" id="052004" >4</span>
 On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth  year of his reign Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,  came with all his forces to storm Jerusalem. They  pitched their camp against it, and surrounded it with 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052005" id="052005" >5</span>
 a siege-wall; so the city was undersiege till the eleventh 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052006" id="052006" >6</span>
 year of king Zedekiah. In the ninth day of the fourth  month – the famine in the city being so severe that 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052007" id="052007" >7</span>
 there was no bread for the people of the land – a  breach was made in the city, and all the soldiers took  to flight, leaving the city during the night by way of the  gate between the two walls by the royal garden–  the city being surrounded by the Chaldeans – and they 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052008" id="052008" >8</span>
 made for the Jordan valley. But the Chaldean army  pursued the king and overtook him in the steppes of  Jericho, all his own army having left him and scattered. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052009" id="052009" >9</span>
 They seized the king and brought him to the king of  Babylon who was at Riblah in the district of Hamath; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052010" id="052010" >10</span>
 and he pronounced judgment upon him. At Riblah  the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before  his eyes, and all the princes of Judah did he also slay; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052011" id="052011" >11</span>
 he then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and having loaded him  with chains, he carried him to Babylon, where he kept  him in the House of Discipline till the day of his death. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052012" id="052012" >12</span>
 On the tenth day of the fifth month of the nineteenth  year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,  Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, one of the  ministers of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052013" id="052013" >13</span>
 and he proceeded to burn the Temple, the palace, and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052014" id="052014" >14</span>
 indeed every house in Jerusalem. All the walls that  encircled Jerusalem were demolished by the Chaldean  forces that were under the commander of the guard. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052015" id="052015" >15</span>
 The rest of the people left in the city, and the deserters  who had gone over the king of Babylon, and those  that were left of the artificers, were carried into exile by 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052016" id="052016" >16</span>
 Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard. Some of  the poorest of the country people were left by Nebuzar-  adan, the commander of the guard, to act as vine-  dressers and ploughmen. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052017" id="052017" >17</span>
 The bronze pillars of the Temple, and the stands,  and the bronze sea that was in the Temple, were broken  in pieces by the Chaldeans, and all the bronze of them 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052018" id="052018" >18</span>
 was taken to Babylon. They also took the pots and  the shovels and the snuffers and the basons and the  pans and all the bronze vessels used in the (Temple) 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052019" id="052019" >19</span>
 service. The goblets and the snuff-dishes (for the  lamps) and the basons and the pots and the lamp-  stands and the pans and the libation bowls – whatever  was of gold or silver respectively – were removed by the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052020" id="052020" >20</span>
 commander of the guard: – the pillars, two; the sea  one; and the bronze bulls that supported the sea,  twelve; and the stands which King Solomon had  made for the Temple, ten; – vessels the mass of whose 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052021" id="052021" >21</span>
 bronze was beyond weight. Each of the pillars was  twenty-seven feet in height, eighteen feet in circum-  ference, three inches in thickness, and hollow within. 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052022" id="052022" >22</span>
 It was surmounted by a bronze capital, seven feet and a  half in height, round which ran network and pome-  granates of bronze throughout; the (network and) 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052023" id="052023" >23</span>
 pomogranate adorment of both pillars was alike. On  the network round about there were a hundred pome-  granates in all, of which ninety-six were visible. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052024" id="052024" >24</span>
 The commander of the guard also took Seraiah the  chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052025" id="052025" >25</span>
 three keepers of the threshold. He took also from the  city a eunuch who had charge of the soldiers, and seven  of the King’s Privy Councillors who were found in  the city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief,  who kept the army register, and sixty of the people of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052026" id="052026" >26</span>
 the land whom he found within the city. Having  seized them, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard,  brought them to Riblah to the king of Babylon; 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052027" id="052027" >27</span>
 and the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah  in the district of Hamath. Thus was Judah carried  from her own land into exile. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052028" id="052028" >28</span>
 These are the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried  into exile; in the seventeenth year (of his reign) 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052029" id="052029" >29</span>
 three thousand and twenty-three Jews; in the eight-  eenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, eight hundred and 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052030" id="052030" >30</span>
 thirty-two persons from Jerusalem; in the twenty-  third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the  commander of the guard carried seven hundred and  forty-five Jews into exile: – in all, four thousand  six hundred. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v024052031" id="052031" >31</span>
 In the thirty seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin,  king of Judah, in the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth  month, Evil-merodach, in the year of his accession to  the throne of Babylon, restored Jehoiachin, king of 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052032" id="052032" >32</span>
 Judah, to favour, liberated him from prison, engaged  him in friendly intercourse, and gave him precedence  over the (other) kings who were (detained) with him 
<span class="verse" rel="v024052033" id="052033" >33</span>
