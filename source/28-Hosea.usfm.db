\mt1 Hosea

\c 1

\p
\v 1 The \nd Lord\nd*'s message to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah and during the reign of King Jeroboam, son of Joash of Israel.
\p
\v 2 When \nd Lord\nd* began to speak through Hosea, he said to him, 
\q “Go marry an unfaithful woman 
\q who will bear you children by her adultery, 
\q for like an adulterous wife the land is unfaithful to the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\p
\v 3 So he married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam, and when she conceived and bore him a son,
\v 4 \nd Lord\nd* said, 
\q “Call him ‘Jezreel,’ for in a little while 
\q I will punish the dynasty of Jehu 
\q for the blood shed at the valley of Jezreel, 
\q I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.
\q
\v 5 On that day, I will break Israel's bows and arrows 
\q in the valley of Jezreel.”
\p
\v 6 When she conceived again and bore a daughter, \nd Lord\nd* said to Hosea:
\q ”Call her  Lo-Ruhamah - ‘No-Compasssion‘
\q for I will no longer have compassion on Israel,
\q certainly not spare them.
\b
\q
\v 7 But on Judah I will have compassion,
\q I will deliver them by the \nd Lord\nd* their God,
\q but I will not deliver them by bow nor by sword,
\q nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.”
\p
\v 8 After she had weaned No-Compassion, and when she conceived and bore a son, he said:
\q
\v 9 “Call him Lo-Ammi - ‘Not-My-People’
\q for you, Israel, are not my people,
\q and I indeed am not your God.”
\b
\q
\v 10 Yet the number of the Israelites 
\q will be as the sand of the sea,
\q which cannot be measured or counted,
\q and where they were told, ‘You are not my people,‘
\q they will be called, ‘children of the living God.’
\q
\v 11 And the Judeans and the Israelites 
\q will join together again,
\q and they will appoint for themselves one leader, 
\q and they will return to their own land.
\q Great will be the day of Jezreel!

\c 2

\q
\v 1 So call your brothers, My People,
\q and your sisters, Compassion.

\p
\v 2 Then Hosea said:
\q Accuse, accuse your mother:
\q for she is not my wife,
\q and I will not be her husband.
\q Let her put her acts of infidelity out of her sight,
\q and her lovers from between her breasts,
\q 
\v 3 else I will strip her bare,
\q expose her as she was on the day of her birth,
\q make her like the wilderness,
\q let her become like a parched land,
\q and let her die of thirst.
\q 
\v 4 And on her children I will have no pity,
\q since they are children of adultery,
\q 
\v 5 for their mother has become a prostitute,
\q she who conceived them has behaved shamefully.
\p She has said,
\q ‘I will go after my lovers
\q who gave me my bread and my water,
\q my wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.’
\q
\v 6 That is why I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns,
\q and build a wall about her,
\q so that she cannot find her paths.
\q 
\v 7 She will pursue her lovers,
\q but will not overtake them.
\q She will seek them,
\q but not find them.
\q In time she will say,
\q ‘I will go back to my first husband,
\q I was better off then than now.’
\q 
\v 8 She herself did not know
\q that it was I who gave her
\q the grain, the sweet wine, and the oil,
\q who lavished on her silver and gold -
\q that they used in worshipping Baal!
\q 
\v 9  So I will take back my grain at the harvest,
\q and my sweet wine in its season.
\q I will withdraw my wool and my flax,
\q given to cover her nakedness;
\q 
\v 10 and so I will strip her naked before her lovers,
\q and no one shall deliver her out of my hand.
\q
\v 11 I will end all her celebrations,
\q her yearly feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths,
\q all her festivals.
\q
\v 12 I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
\q of which she says, “These are my wages
\q which my lovers have given me.”
\q I will make them a thicket,
\q and the wild animals will eat them.
\q
\v 13 In this way I will punish her for the days of the Baals,
\q in which she made offerings to them,
\q and decked herself with earrings and jewels,
\q and went after her lovers,
\q but forgot me,
\q - declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 14 So I am going to court her,
\q bring her into the wilderness,
\q and speak tenderly to her.
\q
\v 15 I will give her from there her vineyards,
\q and the valley of Achor as a door of hope.
\q There she will respond as in the days of her youth,
\q as in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.
\q
\v 16 At that time, declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q you will call me your husband,
\q and will no more call me your master.
\q
\v 17 I will remove the name of the Baals from her mouth,
\q their names never again uttered.
\q 
\v 18 On that day I will make for them a covenant 
\q with the wild animals, and the birds of the sky and the creatures that crawl on the earth,
\q I will break the bow and the sword,
\q banish battle from the land,
\q and I will make them lie down in safety.
\q
\v 19 I will take you for my wife forever,
\q I will take you for my wife in righteousness,
\q in justice, in kindness, and in mercy.
\q
\v 20 I will take you for my wife in faithfulness,
\q and you will know the \nd Lord\nd*.

\b

\q
\v 21 On that day I will answer
\q — declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q I will answer the empty skies,
\q and they will answer the dry earth.
\q
\v 22 The earth will answer with grain,
\q and new wine and oil,
\q and they will answer Jezreel,
\q
\v 23 and I will plant her in the land.
\q
\v 23 I will have compassion to No-Compassion, 
\q I will say to Not-My-People, “You are my people,”
\q and they will say, “You are my God.”

\c 3

\p
\v 1 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, “Go again, show love to this woman, who is loved by another, who commits adultery. Love her as the \nd Lord\n* loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods, and love the raisin cakes offered to idols.

\p
\v 2 So I redeemed her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley. 
\v 3 And I told her, “You must live with me for many days and you must not sleep around or marry another. And I will do the same for you.

\p
\v 4 And like this the Israelites will live for a long time without king and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, without ephod and without teraphim.
\v 5 Yet afterward the Israelites will return, and seek the \nd Lord\nd* their God and their Davidic king, and in the days to come they will turn with awe to the \nd Lord\nd* and his goodness.

\c 4

\q
\v 1 Hear the \nd Lord\nd*'s message, Israelites,
\q for the \nd Lord\nd* has brought charges against the inhabitants of the land,
\q for there is no fidelity, nor true love,
\q nor knowledge of God in the land,
\q
\v 2 but cursing, lying, and murder,
\q stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence,
\q and acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other.
\q
\v 3 Therefore the land mourns,
\q all its inhabitants languish,
\q the wild animals and the birds of the skies,
\q even the fish of the sea are dying.
\q
\v 4 Yet let no one bring charges,
\q let none accuse,
\q for your people are like those,
\q who bring charges against a priest.
\q
\v 5 You stumble by day,
\q and the prophet stumblea with you by night,
\q and I will destroy your mother.
\q
\v 6 My people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge;
\q because you have rejected knowledge
\q I reject you from being priest to me.
\q Since you have forgotten the teaching of your God,
\q I also will forget your children.

\b

\q
\v 7 The more priests there are, the more they sin against me.
\q I will change their dignity to [us:dishonor|cth:dishonour].
\q
\v 8 They feed on the sin offerings of my people,
\q so they hunger after their guilt.
\q
\v 9 Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest:
\q I will visit upon each punishment for their ways,
\q and their deeds I will repay them.
\q
\v 10 They will eat and not be satisfied,
\q they will sleep around but stay childless,
\q because they have abandoned the \nd Lord\nd*
\q to give themselves to

\v 11 prostitution.

\b

\q Old and new wine take away the understanding.
\q
\v 12 My own people ask counsel of a piece of wood!
\q A stick gives them advice!
\q For a spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
\q they commit adultery against their God.
\q
\v 13 On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice,
\q and on the hills they burn incense
\q under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
\q for their shade is so pleasant.
\q Therefore your daughters become cult prostitutes,
\q and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.

\b

\q
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters for commiting prostitution,
\q nor your daughters-in-law for adultery.
\q Your men visit prostitutes,
\q sacrifice with cult prostitutes.
\q So a people without understanding come to ruin!
\q
\v 15 Though you commit adultery, Israel,
\q let not Judah become guilty.
\q Do not go to Gilgal,
\q do not go up to Beth-aven,
\q nor swear an oath, ‘As the \nd Lord\nd* lives.’

\b

\q
\v 16 Like a willful heifer,
\q Israel is stubborn.
\q Can the \nd Lord\nd* now feed them
\q as he would a lamb in a broad pasture?
\q
\v 17  Ephraim is wedded to idols. 
\q Leave them alone!
\q
\v 18 When their drinking is over
\q they sleep with the cult prostitutes,
\q their rulers love shameful ways.\f + \fr 4:18 \ft Heb. obscure.\f*
\p
\q
\v 19  A wind-storm will wrap them in its wings
\q and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices\f + \fr 4:19 \ft LXX: altars.\f*.

\c 5


\q
\v 1 Hear this, priests!
\q Attend, Israelites!
\q Listen, royal family!
\q For you is the judgment:
\q a snare you have become at Mizpeh,
\q and a net spread out on Tabor,
\q
\v 2 the rebels are deep in slaughter,
\q but I will discipline all.
\q
\v 3  I know Ephraim,
\q Israel is not hidden from me,
\q for you, Ephraim, have commited prostitution
\q and Israel is defiled.
\q
\v 4 Their deeds do not permit them
\q to return to their God.
\q For the spirit of prostitution is within them,
\q they do not know the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 5 Israel's arrogance testifies against them,
\q Israel, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin,
\q and Judah also stumbles with them.
\q
\v 6 With their sheep and their cattle 
\q they will go to seek the \nd Lord\nd*
\q but they will not find him,
\q he has withdawn from them,
\q
\v 7 for they have been untrue to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q their children are strangers.
\q Their new moon festivals will soon destroy them and their fields.

\b

\q
\v 8 Blow the trumpet in Gibeah,
\q the clarion in Ramah!
\q Raise the alarm in Beth-aven:
\q we are with you, Benjamin!\f + \fr 5:8 \ft LXX: make Benjamin tremble\f* 
\q
\v 9 Ephraim will become a desolation
\q in the day of punishment,
\q concerning the tribes of Israel
\q I make known what is certain.
\q
\v 10 The princes of Israel have become
\q like thieves who move boundary stones.
\q On them I will pour out my wrath like a flood.
\q
\v 11 Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed by judgment,
\q for they are determined to go after vanity\f + \fr 5:11 \ft So LXX. Heb. obscure. \f*.

\b

\q
\v 12 So I am like a moth to Ephraim,
\q like rottenness to the house of Judah.
\q
\v 13 For when Ephraim saw their sickness
\q and Israel their wound,
\q Ephraim turned to Assyria,
\q to its great king.
\q But he cannot heal you
\q nor relieve you of your wound.
\q
\v 14 For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim,
\q like a young lion to the house of Judah.
\q I, yes I, will rend and go my way,
\q I will carry off and none will rescue.

\b

\q
\v 15 I will return to my place,
\q until in remorse they seek my presence.
\q When they are in distress they will quickly seek me,


\c 6


\q
\v 1 saying, “Come let us return to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q for he has torn us
\q but he will heal us,
\q he has injured us
\q but he will bandage our wounds,
\q
\v 2 he will revive in a couple of days,
\q on the third day he will raise us up again,
\q to live in his presence.
\q
\v 3 Let us know, let us eagerly seek to know the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q His coming is as sure as the sunrise.
\q He will come to us like the winter rain,
\q as the spring rain that waters the earth.”

\b

\q
\v 4 What can I make of you, Ephraim!
\q What can I make of you, Judah!
\q Your love is like a morning cloud,
\q like the dew which early goes away.
\q
\v 5 That is why I have hewn them by the prophets,
\q I have slain them by the words of my mouth.
\q My judgment is like the light that goes forth,
\q
\v 6 for it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice,
\q and knowledge of God and not burnt offerings.

\b

\q
\v 7 But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant,
\q there they have played me false.
\q
\v 8 Gilead is a city of evil-doers,
\q tracked with bloody footprints,
\q
\v 9 and as bandits lie in wait for a man,
\q so a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem.
\q How terrible is the evil they do!
\q
\v 10 In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing.
\q There Ephraim plays the prostitute,
\q Israel is defiled.
\q
\v 11 Judah for you also a harvest is set.

\b

\q When I would restore the fortunes of my people,

\c 7

\q
\v 1 when I would heal Israel,
\q then Ephrain's guilt is revealed,
\q and Samaria's crimes are seen,
\q how they practise fraud 
\q and the thief enters in,
\q while outside bandits plunder.
\q
\v 2 But it never croses their minds
\q that I remember their wickedness.
\q Now their misdeeds surround them,
\q they are always before my face.

\b

\q
\v 3 Their wickedness amuses the king,
\q and their lying gladdens the princes,
\q
\v 4 since they are all of them adulterers.
\q Their desire to do evil
\q burns like an oven heated by the baker,
\q so hot that he need not stir the fire, 
\q from the kneading of the dough, until it rises.
\q
\v 5 On our king's festival day,
\q the princes are flushed with fever from wine.
\q He stretched forth his hand with the contemptuous\f + \fr 7:5 \ft Heb. obscure\f*,
\q
\v 6 for like an oven their heart burns with treachery,
\q all night their anger smolders,
\q in the morning it blazes into a flame of fire.
\q
\v 7 All of them glow like an oven,
\q they devour their rulers.
\q All their kings have fallen.
\q There is none among them who calls to me.

\b

\q
\v 8 Ephraim — he lets himself be mixed among the peoples,
\q Ephraim — he has become a cake unturned.
\q
\v 9 Strangers have devoured his strength, but he does not know it.
\q His hair is sprinkled with grey, but he does not notice.
\q
\v 10 Israel's arrogance testifies against them
\q yet they do not return to the \nd Lord\nd* their God,
\q and in all this they do not seek him.

\b

\q
\v 11 Ephraim is like a simple, silly dove:
\q to Egypt they call, after Assyria they go,
\q
\v 12 wherever they turn I will spread my net over them,
\q like birds of the sky I will bring them down,
\q I will catch them when I hear them gathering.
\q
\v 13 Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!
\q Destruction to them, for they have been untrue to me.

\b

\q Although it was I who redeemed them, 
\q they speak lies about me.
\q
\v 14 They have never cried to me with their hearts,
\q but they are always wailing on their beds.
\q They gather to beg for corn and new wine,
\q but they turn away from me.
\q
\v 15 Although it was I who trained and strengthened their arms,
\q concerning me they plan only evil.
\v 16 They turn away from the Most High.
\q They have become like a bow that swerves.
\q Their princes will fall by the sword,
\q because of the insolence of their tongues.
\q The land of Egypt will mock them.


\c 8


\q
\v 1 They will lick the dust,
\q For as an eagle I will swoop down upon my house,
\q Because they have transgressed my covenant,
\q And trespassed against my law.
\q
\v 2 To me they continually cry,
\q My God, we Israel, know thee
\q
\v 3 Israel has spurned that which is good,
\q Let the foe pursue him.

\b

\q
\v 4 They themselves have made kings but without my consent,
\q They have made princes but without my knowledge,
\q Out of their silver and gold, they have made idols to their destruction!

\q
\v 5 Mine anger is kindled against them,
\q How long will they escape punishment?
\q Thy calf, O Samaria, is distasteful,
\q
\v 6 For from Israel it is also;
\q A workman made and it is not good;
\q Like splinters shall Samaria's calf become.
\q
\v 7 For they sow the wind and reap a whirlwind;
\q A shoot which has no stalk and yields no fruit
\q If it should yield, strangers would devour it.

\b

\q
\v 8 Israel is devoured; already it is among the nations,
\q As a vessel in which there is no pleasure.
\q
\v 9 For by themselves they have gone up to Assyria,
\q As a wild-ass which goes apart by itself.
\q Ephraim gives love-gifts;
\q
\v 10 And if they give themselves among the nations,
\q I must now scatter them,
\q That they may cease a little front anointing kings and princes.

\b

\q
\v 11 For as many altars as Ephraim has erected,
\q They are to him altars for sinning,
\q
\v 12 Were I to write for him ever so many instructions,
\q As those of a stranger would they be regarded.
\q
\v 13 They love sacrifice, and so they offer sacrifices,
\q Flesh, and so they eat it,
\q Although Jehovah is not pleased with them,
\q Therefore he must now remember their guilt,
\q And punish their sins.
\q To Egypt must they return,
\q
\v 14 For Israel forgot his Maker,
\q And Judah built palaces,
\q Judah also multiplied fenced cities;
\q And so I will send fire upon her cities,
\q And it shall devour her palaces..


\c 9


\q
\v 1 Rejoice not too loudly, O Israel, like the heathen,
\q For thou hast played the harlot, being untrue to thy God,
\q Thou hast loved a harlot's hire upon every threshing-floor,
\q
\v 2 Threshing-floor and wine-vat shall not know them,
\q And the new wine shall disown them.
\q
\v 3 They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land,
\q But Ephraim shall return to Egypt,
\q And in Assyria they shall eat what is unclean.

\b

\q
\v 4 They shall not pour out libations of wine to Jehovah,
\q Nor prepare for him their sacrifices,
\q Their bread shall be like the bread of mourning;
\q All who eat it shall defile themselves,
\q For their bread shall be only for their hunger,
\q It shall not come into Jehovah's temple.
\q
\v 5 What will ye do on the day of the festival?
\q Or on the day of Jehovah's feast?

\b

\q
\v 6 For behold they will soon go to Assyria,
\q Egypt shall gather them, Memphis shall bury them,
\q Nettles shall take possession of their treasure of silver,\q Thorns shall come tip in their tents.

\b

\q
\v 7 The days of visitation are come,
\q The days of recompense are at hand,
\q The Israelites shall know,
\q (Who say), The prophet is a fool,
\q The inspired man is raving mad,
\q It is because of the greatness of thy iniquity and the greatness of thy sin.
\q
\v 8 Ephraim acts the spy with my God,
\q A prophet finds the snares of a fowler are in all his ways;
\q In the house of his God they lay hostile plots,
\q 
\v 9 They commit crimes as in the days of Gibeah,
\q (Jehovah) will remember their iniquity,
\q He will visit with punishment their sin.

\b

\q
\v 10 Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel;
\q Like the first fruit on a fig-tree" I saw your fathers;
\q But as soon as they came to Baal-peor, they consecrated themselves to Baal,
\q And became as abominable as the object of their love.

\b

\q
\v 11 Ephraim—like a bird his glory flies away;
\q There shall be no more birth, no more motherhood, no more conception.
\q
\v 12 Even though they bring up their sons, I will bereave them until not a man is left.
\q Verily, woe to them when I look away from them.

\b

\q
\v 13 Ephraim—as I have seen, his sons are destined to be a prey,
\q Yea, Ephraim himself must lead forth his sons to slaughter.
\q
\v 14 Give them, O Jehovah—what wilt thou give?
\q Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts!

\b

\q
\v 15 All their evil culminated in Gilgal, yea, there I learned to hate them.
\q Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them out of my house.
\q I will no longer love them, for all their nobles are rebels.
\q
\v 16 Ephraim is blighted, their root withered,
\q
\v 17 Yea, if they do bear children, I will slay the darlings of their womb;
\q And they shall become wanderers among the nations.


\c 10


\q
\v 1 A luxuriant vine was Israel,
\q He bore fruita lavishly;
\q In proportion to the increase of his fruit he increased altars,
\q In proportion to the beauty of his land he made beautiful the pillars.

\b

\q
\v 2 Their heart is false,
\q Now must they he punished;
\q He himself will break the neck of their altars,
\q He will destroy their pillars.

\b

\q
\v 3 Yea, soon they will be saying,
\q We have no king,
\q For we have not revered Jehovah,
\q And the king, what can he do for us?

\b

\q
\v 4 Speaking words, perjuring themselves, making agreements,
\q And litigation springs up like poppy in a plowed field.
\q
\v 5 For the calf of Beth-avenh
\q The inhabitants of Samaria shall tremble,
\q Yea, his people shall mourn for him,
\q And his priestlings shall writhe for him,
\q For his glory, because it has departed from him.

\b

\q
\v 6 This also they will carry off to Assyria,
\q As a present to the great king.
\q Disgrace shall Ephraim bear.
\q And Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.

\b

\q
\v 7 As for Samaria, her king is cut off,
\q He is like a ship on the face of the waters.

\b

\q
\v 8 And the high places of Israel shall he destroyed,
\q Thorns and thistles shall come upon their altars,
\q And they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us,”

\q And to the hills, “Fall upon us.”

\b

\q
\v 9 From the days of Gibeah is Israel's sin,
\q There they took their stand.
\q Shall not war overtake them in Gibeah?
\q Against the dastards
\v 10 I will come, and chastize them,
\q And peoples shall be gathered against them,
\q To chastize them for their double crimes.

\b

\q
\v 11 Ephraim indeed was a trained heifer that loved to thresh,
\q And I myself laid a yoke upon his fair neck,
\q I made Ephraim draw; he must plow;
\q Jacob must harrow for himself.
\q
\v 12 Sow for yourselves righteousness,
\q Reap the fruits of love;
\q Break up your fallow ground;
\q For it is time to seek Jehovah,
\q To the end that the fruit of righteousness may come to you.
\q
\v 13 But ye have plowed wickedness, iniquity have ye reaped;
\q Ye have eaten the fruit of lies.

\b

\q Because thou hast trusted in chariots, in the multitude of thy warriors,
\q
\v 14 Therefore the alarm of war shall sound in thy cities
\q And all thy fortresses shall be ruined,
\q As Shahnanz laid in ruins Beth-arbel in the day of battle,\q The mother being dashed to pieces over her children.\q
\v 15 Thus will I do to you, O house of Israel,
\q Because of the enormity of your wickedness,
\q In the dawn shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.


\c 11


\q
\v 1 When Israel was young, then I began to love him,
\q And out of Egypt I called his sons.
\q
\v 2 The more I called them,
\q The further they went away from me.
\q They kept sacrificing to Baalim
\q And making offerings to images.

\b

\q
\v 3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
\q Taking them up in my arms;
\q But they did not know that I healed them;
\q
\v 4 With humane cords I ever drew them,
\q With bands of love.
\q And I was to them as one who lifts up the yoke from off their jaws,
\q And bending toward him, I gave him food to eat.

\b

\q
\v 5 He must return to the land of Egypt,
\q Or Assyria will he their king;
\q For they have refused to return to me.
\q
\v 6 Therefore the swords shall whirl in their cities,
\q And shall devour in their fortresses,
\q
\v 7 For my people are bent in rebelling against me,
\q And upon the Baalim they call with one aceord.

\b

\q
\v 8 How can I give thee up, O Ephraim! Give thee over, O Israel!
\q How am I to give thee up as Admah! Make thee like Zeboim!
\q My heart asserts itself,
\q My sympathies are all aglow,
\q
\v 9 I will not carry into effect the fierceness of my anger,
\q I will not turn to destroy Ephraim,
\q For God am I, and not man,
\q Holy in the midst of thee, therefore I will not consume.

\b

\q
\v 10 They will follow after Jehovah;
\q Like a lion he will roar;
\q When he shall roar,
\q Sons from the west shall come hurriedly;
\q
\v 11 They shall come hurriedly like the birds from Egypt,
\q And like doves from the land of Assyria.
\q And he will bring them back to their houses,
\q It is the oracle of Jehovah.

\b

\q
\v 12 Ephraim has encompassed me with falsehood,
\q And the house of Israel with deceit,
\q But Judah is still known with God,
\q And faithful with the Holy One.


\c 12


\q
\v 1 Ephraim herds the wind and hunts the sirocco,
\q All day long they heap up falsehood and fraud,
\q And make a league with Assyria,
\q And carry oil to Egypt.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah bath a charge against Israel,
\q To punish Jacob for his acts,
\q According to his deeds will he requite him,
\q
\v 3 In the womb he supplanted his brother.

\q In a man's strength he contended with God,
\q
\v 4 He contended with the angel and prevailed,
\q He wept and besought mercy of him.
\q At Bethel Jehovah found him,
\q And there he spoke with him.
\q
\v 5 And Jehovah is the God of hosts,
\q Jehovah is his name,
\q Thus thou shouldst by the help of thy God return.
\q
\v 6 Keep true love and justice,
\q Wait on thy God without ceasing.

\b

\q
\v 7 Canaanite! In his hand are false balances; he loves to defraud;
\q 
\v 8 For Ephraim says, “Yes, I have become rich; I have secured wealth for myself,”
\q All his gains will not secure for him exemption for the guilt that he has incurred,
\q
\v 9 For I, Jehovah thy God, from the land of Egypt
\q Will make thee again dwell in tents, as in time days of old.

\b

\q
\v 10 Yet I spoke continually by the prophets,
\q And it was I who multiplied visions,
\q And spoke in parables through the prophets.

\b

\q
\v 11 Gileads is iniquity, yea they have wrought vanity,
\q In Gilgal they sacrifice to demons;
\q So their altars shall be as stone-heaps,
\q Among the furrows of the field.

\q
\v 12 And Jacob fled to the territory of Aram,
\q And Israel served for a wife,
\q Yea, for a wife he herded sheep.
\q
\v 13 And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt,
\q And by a prophet he was guarded.

\b

\q
\v 14 Ephraim has given bitter provocation
\q His guilt of bloodshed his Lord will leave upon him,
\q And for his reproach he will repay him.


\c 13


\q
\v 1 When Ephraim used to speak there was trembling;
\q A prince was he in Israel.
\q But he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
\q
\v 2 And now they go on sinning;
\q They make for themselves molten gods —
\q From their silver, idols according to their own model;
\q  Smiths”
work all of it!
\q To such they speak!
\q Men who sacrifice kiss calves!

\b

\q
\v 3 Therefore they shall be like the morning cloud,
\q Like the dew that early disappears,
\q Like the chaff which blows away from the threshing-floor,
\q And like the smoke from the window.

\b

\q
\v 4 Yet it was I, Jehovah, thy God,
\q Who brought thee up from the land of Egypt,
\q And a God beside me thou knowest not,
\q Nor has there been any saviour except me.

\b

\q
\v 5 It was I who shepherded thee in the wilderness,
\q In the land of burning heat.
\q
\v 6 As they fed, they were filled to the full,
\q They were filled to the full so that their heart was lifted up;
\q Therefore they forgot me!

\b

\q
\v 7 And so I will be to them like a lion,
\q Like a leopard will I lay in wait by the way,
\q
\v 8 I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of its young,
\q And will tear open that which encloses their hearts,
\q And there the lions of the forest shall devour them,
\q And the wild beasts shall tear them in pieces.

\b

\q
\v 9 In the time of destruction, O Israel, who will help thee?
\q
\v 10 Where is thy king now that he may deliver thee?
\q And all thy princes that they may secure for thee justice?
\q Those of whom thou least said,
\q “Give me kings and princes.”
\q
\v 11 I give thee kings in my anger,
\q And take them away in my wrath.

\b

\q
\v 12 Ephrahn's iniquity is gathered up; his sin is laid by in store.
\q
\v 13 The pangs of childbirth come upon him, but he is an unwise child;
\q For this is no time to stand in the mouth of the womb.

\b

\q
\v 14 Shall I deliver them from the power of Sheol?
\q Shall I redeem them from death?
\q Come on with thy plagues, O death!
\q On with thy pestilence, O Sheol!
\q Relenting is forever hid from mine eyes.

\b

\q
\v 15 Though he is flourishing in the midst of the reedgrass,
\q There shall come an east wind, Jehovah's wind,
\q Coming up from the wilderness;
\q And his fountain shall dry up,
\q And his spring shall be parched;
\q While the foes shall strip the treasure,
\q Consisting of all precious things.

\b

\q
\v 16 Samaria shall bear her guilt;
\q For she has rebelled against her God.
\q They shall fall by the sword,
\q Their children shall be dashed to pieces,
\q And their women with child shall be ripped up.


\c 14


\q
\v 1 Return, O Israel, to Jehovah thy God;
\q For thou has stumbled through thine iniquity.
\q
\v 2 Take words with thee,
\q And return to Jehovah thy God.

\b

\q Say to him:
\q Do thou wholly pardon iniquity and let us receive favor;
\q And thus we will pay the fruit of our lips;
\q
\v 3 Assyria will not save us;
\q We will not ride upon horses to Egypt;
\q And we will no more say, “Our God,”

\q To the work of our hands.
\q For in thee the orphan finds mercy.

\b

\q
\v 4 I will heal their apostasy,
\q I will love them freely,
\q Now that my anger is turned away from them,
\q
\v 5 I will be as dew to Israel.

\b

\q He shall blossom as the lily,
\q And he shall strike in his roots like Lebanon.
\q And his saplings shall spread out,
\q
\v 6 And his beauty shall be like that of the olive tree.

\b

\q
\v 7 They shall return and dwell in my shadow,
\q And they shall live well-watered like a garden.
\q And they shall sprout like the vine;
\q Their renown shall be like that of the wine of Lebanon.

\b

\q
\v 8 Ephraim — what more has he to do with idols!
\q It is I Jehovah who respond to him and look after him,
\q I am like an ever green cypress;
\q From me is thy fruit found.

\b

\q 
\v 9 Whoever is wise, let him discern these things,
\q Prudent, let him perceive them;
\q For Jehovah's ways are straight,
\q And the righteous walk in them,
\q But the wicked stumble in them.
